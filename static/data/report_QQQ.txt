## Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) Report

**Summary:**  Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Nasdaq-100 Index.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

QQQ's cumulative return (98.01%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 73.15%. The difference is 24.9%, placing it at the 42.5th percentile of its historical range of outperformance against VOO (ranging from -3.2% to 62.9%).  This suggests QQQ's recent outperformance is notable but not exceptionally unusual within its historical context.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows periods of strong performance, exceeding 100% in 2019-2021. However, the 2020-2022 period shows a negative return of -7.0%, highlighting the volatility inherent in this investment.  Alpha consistently remains positive, indicating outperformance relative to the benchmark, particularly notable in years 2017-2019 and 2019-2021, while the beta, generally around 1, suggests similar volatility as the market.  The market cap significantly increases over time. Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate substantial potential losses during market downturns.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $423.69
* **5-day Moving Average:** $449.17
* **20-day Moving Average:** $471.11
* **60-day Moving Average:** $501.81

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price change of $0.24 (from $422.67) is minor and not indicative of a significant price movement, either upward or downward.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk category) suggests elevated risk in the market.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.03  This indicates the asset is oversold, potentially suggesting a near-term bounce but not a definitive signal.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.02. This negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.8% suggests a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 35.8% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500. This optimistic outlook should be viewed cautiously, considering the inherent uncertainties in long-term market predictions.


**Conclusion:**

While QQQ has historically outperformed the S&P 500, recent price action and indicators suggest a potential period of weakness.  The high Market Risk Indicator and negative PPO warrant caution.  The high expected return is contingent on long-term market conditions and should be weighed against the risks highlighted by the MDD values and the current oversold RSI.  Investors should consider their risk tolerance and long-term investment horizon before making any decisions.
