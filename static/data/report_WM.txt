* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.27 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so.)

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management Inc. demonstrates a strong historical track record of outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potentially short-term bearish trend. While the company shows consistent revenue growth and healthy profit margins, recent EPS figures need further investigation. The high expected long-term return is promising but carries inherent investment risk. Investors should consider the high Beta, indicating sensitivity to overall market fluctuations,  and the current high-risk MRI before making investment decisions.  Further due diligence, including a thorough review of the inconsistent EPS data and a deeper understanding of the underlying drivers of recent price movements, is recommended.
