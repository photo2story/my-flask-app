## Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) Stock Report

This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE), a leading clean energy company, based on provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return (49.20%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (73.15%).  The difference is -23.9%, placing it at the 20.3rd percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500's range of -52.7% to 89.5%.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta >1, significantly higher volatility than the S&P 500). While CAGR was high in some periods (reaching 116% from 2019-2021), recent years (2021-2025) show negative CAGR.  The high Beta suggests NEE's returns are highly correlated with the overall market, but its Alpha (which is inconsistent from year to year) suggests limited outperformance.  The substantial Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight significant periods of risk.  Note that the provided data for 2023-2025 is projected and may not reflect the actual performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

NEE's closing price is $65.06, down $2.76 from the previous close ($66.91).  This represents a recent drop, as evidenced by the moving averages:

* **5-day MA:** $69.10
* **20-day MA:** $70.69
* **60-day MA:** $70.10

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The -2.76 change in price from the previous close suggests a notable recent price drop that should be considered.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.4792 (High Risk) suggesting significant market volatility concerning NEE.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE is a financially strong company with consistent profitability and growing equity. However, its recent performance significantly lags the S&P 500, showing high volatility and significant drawdowns. While the long-term expected return is positive relative to the S&P 500, the high market risk and the recent price drop necessitate caution.  Investors should carefully consider the high beta and the substantial risk indicated by the high MDD values before investing.  Further investigation into the drivers of the recent underperformance is recommended, as is a thorough analysis of the projected 2023-2025 data.  The oversold RSI might indicate a potential short-term bounce, but the overall picture suggests a more conservative approach.
