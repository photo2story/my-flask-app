## XRP-USD Stock Report

**0. Overview:**

XRP-USD, representing Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency, shows significant price volatility and high potential returns compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), but also carries substantial risk.  Key figures indicate a strong divergence from the market benchmark, with considerably higher cumulative returns, but also periods of substantial losses.


**1. Cumulative Return Comparison:**

XRP-USD's cumulative return (235.29%) drastically outperforms VOO's (50.98%). The difference (184.3%) places it in the upper quartile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, based on the provided relative divergence of 27.1%. However, this high return comes with significant volatility as demonstrated by the Alpha and Beta analysis which shows considerable fluctuation and dependence on market conditions.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -52.0%   | 47.5%   | -69.0% | 0.2    | 11.2   |
| 2018-2020  | -303.0%  | 66.5%   | -333.0%| 0.1    | 12.8   |
| 2019-2021  | 182.0%  | 66.5%   | 108.0% | 0.0    | 48.5   |
| 2020-2022  | 26.0%   | 66.5%   | 16.0%  | -0.0   | 20.1   |
| 2021-2023  | 63.0%   | 63.5%   | 42.0%  | 0.5    | 36.4   |
| 2022-2024  | 313.0%  | 67.4%   | 293.0% | 0.4    | 121.3  |
| 2023-2025  | 226.0%  | 67.4%   | 212.0% | 2.1    | 112.5  |

The highly variable CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate),  MDD (Maximum Drawdown), and Alpha highlight the substantial risk associated with XRP-USD.  The Beta fluctuates, suggesting sensitivity to market movements, but also periods of independence.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $1.928
* **Last Market Price:** $1.930 (Slight increase of 0.63% from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $2.036
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $2.233
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $2.363

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend in the short term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Risk Assessment:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 20.57 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce but also remaining in a bearish territory)
* **PPO:** -1.26 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.6 (Short-term upward momentum)

The high MRI, low RSI, and negative PPO values suggest a bearish outlook. The positive relative divergence change indicates a recent short-term upward trend, possibly a temporary bounce before resuming the downward trend. The small positive change in the last market price doesn't signify a significant reversal, though it does suggest some degree of short term price stabilization.  

**Expected Return:**

The provided 3.2% expected return needs further context. Is this a yearly return?  A return relative to the S&P 500? Specifying this is crucial.  However, even with this information, the statement that it represents a long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500 needs further support. Given the high volatility and risk profile of XRP-USD, a long-term outperformance of the S&P 500 is not guaranteed despite the potentially larger return.  The data provided does not account for the substantial risk involved in investing in XRP-USD.

**Conclusion:**

XRP-USD has demonstrated significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 historically, but this comes with considerable risk as shown by the extreme volatility.  While the recent data hints at potential short-term upward movements, current technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  Investing in XRP-USD requires a high-risk tolerance.  Further investigation into the underlying fundamentals and market conditions is essential before making any investment decision.
