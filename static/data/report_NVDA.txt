**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $97.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $102.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $112.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $123.43

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent price increase (Last-market) shows a 3.53% jump from the previous close, indicating a potential short-term bounce.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 28.90 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.48 (Bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -2.2% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1321.1% (Significant outperformance of S&P 500 expected)

The combination of an oversold RSI and negative PPO suggests potential for a short-term rebound, but the high MRI and the price being below moving averages indicate caution.  The high expected return reflects the historical outperformance, but this is not a guarantee of future returns. The 3.53% price jump suggests a short-term market reaction but doesn't negate the overall bearish trend suggested by the moving averages.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NVDA exhibits exceptionally high growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over various periods.  However, this growth comes with considerable volatility.

The high expected return based on historical data needs to be considered alongside the current market risks and potential for short-term corrections.  Long-term investors may find the risk-reward profile attractive, but careful monitoring of the market and technical indicators is advised.
