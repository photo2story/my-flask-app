## Albemarle Corp (ALB) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** Albemarle Corporation is a leading global producer of lithium, bromine, and related chemicals.  This report analyzes ALB's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO) and examining key financial indicators.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Albemarle's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's.

* **ALB Cumulative Return:** -30.98%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 73.15%
* **Return Difference:** -104.1%  This shows ALB underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. The relative divergence of -5.1% indicates that ALB's performance is considerably below the S&P 500, compared to its historical volatility against the S&P 500.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant volatility in ALB's performance and beta over the years.  High beta values (e.g., 13.7 in 2015-2017) indicate higher sensitivity to market movements than the S&P 500.  Negative alpha values suggest underperformance compared to the market's risk-adjusted return.  The fluctuating alpha highlights the inconsistency in ALB's outperformance or underperformance relative to the market. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is also very volatile, showcasing a risky investment.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |

| 2017-2019  | -52.0%   | 19.7%    | -82.0%| 0.5   | 8.1    |
| 2018-2020  | 70.0%    | 78.0%    | 39.0% | 0.1   | 16.6   |
| 2019-2021  | 221.0%   | 78.0%    | 147.0%| -0.2  | 26.5   |
| 2020-2022  | 141.0%   | 78.0%    | 132.0%| 0.1   | 24.8   |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

ALB's price shows a downward trend.

* **Closing Price:** $58.1
* **5-day Moving Average:** $65.44
* **20-day Moving Average:** $73.04
* **60-day Moving Average:** $79.16

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting bearish momentum.  The price decreased by $0.7 from the previous close.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

The indicators suggest a bearish market sentiment for ALB.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 8.44 (Extremely oversold;  often signals a potential reversal, but not guaranteed)
* **PPO:** -2.37 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.9 (Short-term upward movement, but in context of other indicators, this is minor)

The extremely low RSI, combined with a negative PPO and the MRI placing ALB in a high-risk category,  suggest strong bearish sentiment. The recent price drop further strengthens this bearish outlook.  The high expected return is likely based on long-term projections and doesn't negate the current bearish trend.  The 1067.5% expected return is a very high number and should be examined carefully to understand the underlying assumptions.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings show significant volatility and recent losses.  The repetition of the 2023-11-01 data in the table requires clarification; It's unclear if this is a duplicate entry or a reporting error.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | -9.45  | $1.35 B       |
| 2024-07-31 | -1.96  | $1.43 B       |
| 2024-05-01 | -0.08  | $1.36 B       |
| 2023-11-01 | 2.58   | $2.31 B       |
| 2024-11-06 | 2.58   | $2.31 B       |


The substantial negative EPS in the recent quarters points to significant financial challenges for the company.  The discrepancy between the 2024 November data points needs to be resolved before accurate conclusions can be drawn.

**5) Financial Information:**

The financial information reveals a concerning trend of declining profitability.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.23B  | 11.22%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.35B  | -7.68%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.43B  | -0.74%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.36B  | 2.86%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.36B  | -29.88%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE          |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.96B  | 0.76%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $10.24B | -10.44%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $11.22B | -1.68%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.53B | 0.02%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.41B  | -6.56%       |

The significant drop in revenue and recurring negative profit margins raise serious concerns about the company's financial health.  The negative ROE in multiple quarters suggests that the company is not generating returns on its equity.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

ALB's performance is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  Technical indicators point to a strong bearish sentiment.  Recent earnings show substantial losses and declining profitability.  The company faces considerable financial challenges. While a long-term outlook might suggest higher potential returns (as indicated by the expectation of 1067.5% increase), the current situation is extremely bearish, and this expectation should be thoroughly reviewed against the current financial reports.  A thorough review of the duplicated earnings data point is necessary to provide a more accurate analysis.  Before considering any investment in ALB, a comprehensive risk assessment and in-depth analysis of the company's future prospects are crucial.  The current data strongly suggests caution.
