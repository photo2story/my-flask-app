**6. Overall Analysis:**

AEP shows mixed signals.

A deeper dive into AEP's future growth strategy and an analysis of macroeconomic factors affecting the utility sector is necessary before forming a conclusive opinion.  Further research is needed to confirm the validity of the negative expected return and to understand the drivers behind the recent price decline.  Given the current market sentiment and technical indicators, a wait-and-see approach might be prudent before making significant investment decisions.
