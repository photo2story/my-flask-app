**0. Key Figures Summary:**

Boeing Co (BA) shows a significantly negative cumulative return compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  While VOO shows substantial growth, BA's performance lags considerably.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $138.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $152.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $165.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $171.52

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The price increased slightly from the previous close ($136.59), showing a change of $1.66, which is not a significant surge.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 34.05 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce but not confirmation of a trend reversal)
* **PPO:** -2.24 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.8 (Short-term upward movement but within a larger downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -366.7% (This extremely negative expected return relative to S&P 500 over the long term is a significant red flag).

The combination of a high MRI, oversold RSI, negative PPO, and dramatically negative expected return paint a cautious outlook.  While the recent small price increase and positive short-term relative divergence suggest a possible temporary bounce, the overall picture is bearish.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistency. While revenue remains relatively stable around $25B, EPS fluctuates.  There's no clear upward or downward trend discernible from this limited data. Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying drivers of these fluctuations.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | 25.34 B$ |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.83 | 25.38 B$ |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.77 | 25.82 B$ |
| 2023-10-31 | 0.91 | 25.17 B$ |

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals significant concerns:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates, showing no consistent growth.
* **Profit Margin:**  Highly volatile profit margins, with significant negative values in recent quarters, point to operational challenges.
* **Equity:**  Negative equity in several recent quarters is a critical warning sign of potential financial distress.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Boeing Co (BA) presents a highly risky investment proposition.  The stock significantly underperforms the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility and inconsistent profitability. Negative equity and volatile profit margins raise serious concerns about the company's financial health.  While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, the negative expected return and other indicators paint a predominantly bearish picture.  A long-term investment requires careful consideration of these significant risks and the potentially massive underperformance against a broad market index like the S&P 500.  Further in-depth research is strongly recommended before any investment decision is made.  The extremely negative projected return (-366.7%) warrants intense scrutiny of the underlying assumptions and model used to generate this prediction.
