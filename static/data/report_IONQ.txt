**0. Key Figures Overview:**

IONQ Inc. is a company focused on developing and commercializing trapped-ion quantum computers.  The company shows significant growth potential but also considerable risk due to its high volatility and negative profitability.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **IONQ Cumulative Return:** 78.72%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 13.14%
* **Return Difference:** 65.58%

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility (high Beta values) and inconsistent performance across different periods.  While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is high, the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is also substantial, highlighting the significant risk associated with this investment.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $22.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $23.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $30.62

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend after a recent surge. The significant daily increase warrants further investigation into potential news or events that may have influenced the price movement.

The high MRI value indicates high risk. Despite the positive PPO and short-term upward trend, the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises concerns about long-term profitability.  The 10.01% daily price increase is a notable event, and further research is required to identify the underlying cause.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

IONQ shows high growth potential in a rapidly developing sector, reflected in its impressive past returns.  However, the company is currently unprofitable, highly volatile (high beta), and carries significant risk (high MRI). The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500, along with the consistent negative ROE, raises significant concerns about long-term investment viability.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution and thoroughly research the company's future prospects and financial sustainability before investing. The recent price surge requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.  This is a high-risk, high-reward situation.
