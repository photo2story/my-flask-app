Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of these fluctuations.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $140.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $154.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $160.20
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $156.41

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price drop (-2.18) should be considered.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 24.08 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.73 (Bearish)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -6.6% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 8.8% (above S&P 500)

The technical indicators point towards a bearish market sentiment. The RSI suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a bounce, however, combined with the negative PPO, further decline is possible. The high MRI reinforces the high-risk assessment. The expected return of 8.8% over the S&P 500 suggests potential long-term value.

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출        |

| 2024-11-07 | 3.48  | 51.92 B$    | *(Note: Duplicate entry)*


There's a duplicate entry in the data.  EPS and revenue show some volatility, with a notable decline in EPS in the most recent quarter.  More analysis is needed to understand the underlying reasons for these fluctuations.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

CVX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in the long term, although this level of underperformance is not unprecedented historically.  Short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend, with the stock trading below its moving averages and showing oversold conditions (RSI). However, the expected long-term return of 8.8% above the S&P 500 and the high risk indicator warrant further investigation.  Earnings have shown some volatility, and a deeper dive into the financial statements is needed to fully understand the company's financial health and future prospects.  The high risk indicated by the MRI should be carefully considered before making any investment decisions.  Further analysis of the reasons for the fluctuating CAGR and Alpha would also be highly beneficial.
