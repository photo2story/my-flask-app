* **Closing Price:** $143.34
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $155.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $162.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $171.81

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price drop of -$1.86 (from $146.05) reinforces this negative trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 27.24 (Significantly oversold, suggesting potential for a bounce but not confirming an uptrend)
* **PPO:** -1.15 (Negative momentum, confirming the downtrend)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.2 (Short-term upward movement, but needs confirmation)
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High risk, caution is advised)
* **Expected Return:** -77.3% (This extremely negative figure warrants further investigation and consideration of underlying assumptions.  It suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the long term and is likely a result of various risk factors including the current downward trend, and economic and market projections.)

The technical indicators suggest that SPG is currently in oversold territory, and a bounce might occur but the negative price momentum must be considered.  The -77.3% expected return is concerning and should prompt a thorough investigation into the model's assumptions and relevant market factors.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, exhibiting high volatility and inconsistent performance.  While financial statements show strong profitability and high profit margins, the negative price momentum, oversold RSI, negative PPO, and high market risk indicator warrant caution. The extremely negative projected return requires careful scrutiny of its underlying assumptions.  Before making any investment decisions, a more comprehensive analysis, including thorough due diligence and consideration of external factors, is strongly recommended.  The data suggests a high-risk investment, and further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance relative to the market is crucial.
