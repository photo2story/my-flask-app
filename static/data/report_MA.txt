**6) Overall Analysis:**

Mastercard (MA) demonstrates a strong historical performance significantly outpacing the S&P 500.  However, the recent price action indicates a potential short-term downtrend, supported by negative momentum indicators (PPO) and the price being below its moving averages.  The oversold RSI suggests a potential rebound.  Strong financial results, high profit margins, and above-expectation EPS point to a fundamentally sound company.  The high Market Risk Indicator suggests higher volatility.  While the long-term outlook remains positive based on the provided expected return, investors should carefully consider the current market conditions and volatility before making investment decisions.  Further investigation into the methodology of the expected return calculation is recommended.
