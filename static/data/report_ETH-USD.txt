ETH-USD has historically shown substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with considerable volatility and risk.  Current technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the price is still trending downwards.  The high expected return over the long term is contingent on the successful navigation of this high-risk environment.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in ETH-USD.  The provided data suggests that while long-term potential is high, substantial losses are also possible.
