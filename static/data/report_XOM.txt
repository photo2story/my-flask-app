## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

Exxon Mobil Corp is one of the world's largest integrated oil and gas companies.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

XOM's cumulative return (55.83%) lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (73.15%) by 17.3%.  This places it at the 59th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a range of -100.8% to 40.8%).

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows fluctuating performance relative to the market (S&P 500).  While showing periods of outperformance (positive alpha), particularly in 2020-2022 (likely driven by increased oil prices), there are also periods of significant underperformance (negative alpha) and high maximum drawdown (MDD).  The beta consistently hovers around 1, indicating a relatively similar volatility to the market.  Market capitalization fluctuates considerably throughout the period.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

XOM's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500.  While the company benefits from high profit margins and relatively stable revenue, the current price is below key moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term outlook.  Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) point towards oversold conditions, but the high Market Risk Indicator suggests caution. The provided 0.5% expected return for long-term investment needs clarification regarding its calculation and justification.  Further investigation into the reasons for the fluctuation in EPS and the large increase in Equity in Q2 2024 is recommended before making any investment decisions.  A thorough review of the company's future prospects, particularly regarding the energy transition and future oil demand, is crucial.
