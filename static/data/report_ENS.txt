**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

EnerSys is a global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), ENS has significantly underperformed, showing a 51.3% lower cumulative return. While the relative divergence suggests this underperformance is within the historical range of variation,  it is still considerably below the benchmark.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and a relatively high and stable beta (around 2.9-3.0) throughout the years.  This suggests ENS's returns are significantly correlated with the overall market (high beta) but with varying degrees of outperformance (alpha).  The high beta indicates high market sensitivity.  Note that the provided alpha and beta figures vary significantly year-to-year, implying that the model used to calculate these metrics is not particularly robust and should be interpreted with caution.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 13.0% | 13.4% | -16.0% | 0.1 | 2.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 34.0% | 9.6% | 15.0% | 2.9 |
| 2017-2019  | -17.0% | 17.2% | -48.0% | 1.4 | 2.8 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $81.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $86.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $93.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.78

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase of $0.21 (from $80.89) represents a small positive change, but it is still significantly below its recent highs.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 15.75 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce, but not confirming an uptrend.)
* **PPO:** -1.80 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +12.3% (Short-term upward movement, but needs further confirmation)
* **Expected Return:** -109.8% (This extremely negative figure suggests a very pessimistic outlook.  The reliability of this figure needs to be verified; such a large negative return is unlikely.)
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)

The technical indicators paint a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the PPO and the significantly negative expected return suggest a continuation of the downtrend. The MRI also shows a high market risk, reinforcing the cautious view. The recent small price increase might be a temporary bounce within a larger downtrend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  While recent earnings show growth, the stock price is trading below its moving averages and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend. The extremely negative expected return (-109.8%) needs further investigation to confirm its validity. The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  The high market risk indicator reinforces the cautious outlook.  Before investing, further due diligence is crucial, including verifying the accuracy and source of the provided data, especially concerning the expected return.  A long-term investment strategy might be considered only after a thorough review of the company's fundamentals and a more robust market analysis.  The current situation suggests high risk and low reward for a long-term investment without further research and consideration of alternative investments.
