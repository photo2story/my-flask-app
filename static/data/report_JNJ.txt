While exhibiting periods of positive Alpha (outperformance), particularly in 2017-2019 and 2018-2020, recent years show negative Alpha and a Beta consistently around 0.3-0.4, suggesting lower volatility than the overall market but also lower returns.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-23 | $1.12 | $22.47B       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the analyzed period, despite maintaining high revenue and profit margins.  Recent price action shows a downtrend, supported by bearish technical indicators. The significant fluctuation in EPS needs further investigation.  While the long-term outlook relative to the S&P 500 is unclear, the negative expected return and high market risk indicate caution is warranted before investment.  A thorough investigation of the unusual EPS spike in Q4 2023 and a deeper dive into the underlying factors influencing ROE and the recent price drop is crucial before making any investment decisions.
