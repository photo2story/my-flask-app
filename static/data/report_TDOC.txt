| Date       | EPS     | Revenue        |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19  | $0.64B         |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92  | $0.64B         |

| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35  | $0.66B         | *(Duplicate entry - potential data error)*


The company is consistently reporting losses. Revenue is relatively stable, but the massive negative EPS in August 2024 is a significant concern.  Data inconsistencies (duplicate entry) need clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B | 70.50% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B | -3.25% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77% |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58% |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24% |


While revenue remains relatively consistent, the negative ROE across all quarters is extremely worrying, pointing to significant issues in profitability and return on investment. The exceptionally low ROE in Q2 2024 (-55.77%) requires further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is currently experiencing significant challenges.  Consistent losses, negative ROE, and a substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 paint a bleak picture.  While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, the negative PPO and overall trend indicate a bearish outlook. The high risk MRI further strengthens the negative outlook.  Before considering any investment, thorough due diligence is crucial to understand the reasons behind the company's poor performance and whether a turnaround is likely.  The provided -1668.7% expected return is unrealistic and should be disregarded.  A more realistic long-term outlook requires deeper fundamental analysis of the business model, competitive landscape, and management strategy.  Addressing the data inconsistencies in the earnings reports is essential before drawing concrete conclusions.
