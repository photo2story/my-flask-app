* **20-Day Moving Average:** $145.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $158.19

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $3.28 (Last-market data) indicates a short-term positive move, but further observation is needed to confirm a trend reversal.

| 2023-12-31 | $0.31B | 51.38% |

Revenue shows consistent growth.  Profit margins are high, but this needs to be considered alongside the negative EPS, suggesting potential accounting or reporting differences that require further investigation.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE     |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.20B | -4.50%  |

| 2023-12-31 | $0.77B | -10.20% |

Equity is increasing, but the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital. This is a significant concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA exhibits high growth potential but also extremely high risk.  While past performance shows significant outperformance against the S&P 500, the persistent negative EPS and ROE raise serious questions about the sustainability of this performance. The high volatility, as indicated by the CAGR, MDD, and Beta, necessitates a cautious approach. The high expected return should be considered alongside the significant risk. Further investigation is crucial to understand the reasons behind the high profit margins despite negative EPS and to assess the long-term viability of the company's business model.  Investors should carefully consider the risks before investing in NTRA.  Independent verification of the data and professional financial advice are highly recommended.
