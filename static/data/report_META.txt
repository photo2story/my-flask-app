## Meta Platforms Inc. (META) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Meta Platforms Inc. is a technology company focused on social networking and online advertising.  This report analyzes META's performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), considering recent price movements, financial indicators, and earnings data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

META's cumulative return (177.06%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (73.15%). The difference is 103.9%, placing META at the 74.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  This suggests strong relative performance, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows significant variation in performance year over year, highlighting the volatility inherent in META's stock.  High Alpha values in recent years (2.6 and 2.7) suggest outperformance relative to the market benchmark, but this needs to be viewed in conjunction with the high Beta values which indicate high sensitivity to market fluctuations.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 60.0% | 6.5% | 30.0% | 0.0 | 445.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $516.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $544.51
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $585.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $639.08

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price change of $2.28 (from $504.73) indicates a small upward movement, but it's not substantial enough to signify a significant reversal of the downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk category)
* **RSI:** 33.16 (Suggests oversold conditions, but not a definitive buy signal)
* **PPO:** -1.32 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.2% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -1.3% (This is a short-term expectation.  Long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is positive, given the historical outperformance, but highly dependent on future market conditions and META's performance).  The relatively high Beta suggests a significant market influence on the potential outperformance.

The small price increase of $2.28 doesn't represent a significant rebound.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

META has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the past, although this has been quite volatile.  Currently, the stock price is below its moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  Technical indicators show mixed signals, with RSI suggesting oversold conditions and PPO indicating bearish momentum.  The high MRI indicates high risk.  Earnings are showing growth, and the company exhibits strong profitability and growing equity.  However, the high Beta suggests considerable market risk.  A long-term investment (2+ years) may offer potential outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this depends heavily on future market conditions and META's ability to maintain its growth trajectory.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry is necessary for a more comprehensive analysis.  The high risk indicated by multiple indicators suggests careful consideration before investment.
