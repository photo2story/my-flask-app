**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Southern Company (SO) is an American energy company providing electricity to millions of customers.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) by 25.26 percentage points. This outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical range (-46.5% to 30.2%), placing it at the 93.6th percentile of its historical relative performance.

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows varying performance across different periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market, represented by beta), others show negative alpha.  The beta fluctuates, indicating variable sensitivity to market movements. Notably, the market capitalization (Cap(B)) consistently increases over time.  A more detailed regression analysis would be needed to establish consistent and statistically significant alpha and beta values.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of $87.22 is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating a possible longer-term support level.  The recent price drop of $1.93 (from $88.94) shows a negative short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Divergence:**

The RSI of 39.77 is below 50, suggesting the stock is currently in oversold territory. The negative PPO (-0.36) indicates bearish momentum. The recent 20-day relative divergence of +8.9 suggests a short-term upward trend, which contradicts the negative price movement.  This divergence could be a signal of a potential short-term reversal, but requires further confirmation. The high MRI (0.48) suggests high market risk, indicating potential volatility.  The expected return of 0.3% over the long term suggests a relatively modest outperformance against the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |

| 2024-02-15 | 0.64   | 0.6          | 0.04       |

In several quarters, Southern Company exceeded analysts' EPS expectations.  This suggests positive earnings performance. However, a single data point for 2025 is insufficient for reliable analysis.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Southern Company (SO) shows a strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn.  While earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations in several quarters,  the current technical indicators (RSI, PPO) and high market risk indicator signal caution.  The long-term outlook, based on the expected return and historical outperformance, remains relatively positive for long-term investors, but this should be considered in conjunction with broader market conditions and a thorough assessment of the company's fundamentals and risk tolerance.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
