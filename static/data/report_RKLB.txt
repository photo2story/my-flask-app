Early years (2020-2023) show negative or low returns, while recent years (2022-2025) demonstrate substantial growth. The negative alpha values suggest underperformance relative to the benchmark (which is not specified but likely the market), except for the last two years, which suggest significant outperformance.

The daily price change of +7.03% signifies a sharp upward movement.  The combination of a high MRI and negative expected return suggests caution despite short-term positive momentum.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date        | EPS     | Revenue      |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-12  | -$0.1   | $0.10B       |
| 2024-08-08  | -$0.08  | $0.11B       |
| 2024-05-06  | -$0.09  | $0.09B       |
| 2023-11-08  | -$0.08  | $0.07B       |
| 2024-11-12  | -$0.08  | $0.07B       |

*Analysis:* The company consistently reports negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  While revenue shows some growth, it's not sufficient to offset the losses.  This aligns with the negative expected return.  There's also a potential data entry error, as the November 12, 2024 entry is duplicated.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.13B      | 27.81%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.10B      | 26.71%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.11B      | 25.56%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.09B      | 26.06%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.06B      | 25.82%        |

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE           |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.38B      | -13.69%       |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.42B      | -12.37%       |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.46B      | -9.15%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.48B      | -9.24%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.55B      | -9.11%        |

*Analysis:* Revenue shows a positive trend, with improving profit margins. However, the negative ROE consistently indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity.  This is a significant concern and needs further investigation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

RKLB shows a high degree of volatility and risk. While it has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the recent past, this is accompanied by substantial losses (negative EPS) and negative ROE.  The high Market Risk Indicator and negative long-term expected return suggest caution.  While the recent price movement and some financial metrics show positive trends, the fundamental data (negative EPS and ROE) paints a concerning picture.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price surge and the sustainability of the revenue growth is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility warrants careful consideration of risk tolerance.
