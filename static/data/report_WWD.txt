## Woodward Inc. (WWD) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Woodward Inc. (WWD) shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While detailed analysis follows, the initial observation suggests strong potential but warrants further investigation into the drivers of this outperformance and its sustainability.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Woodward Inc. is a designer, manufacturer, and service provider of energy control and related products.

* **WWD Cumulative Return:** 103.23%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 73.15%
* **Return Difference:** 30.08%  (WWD outperformed VOO by 30.08%)
* **Relative Outperformance:** 71.2% (This indicates WWD's outperformance is in the 71.2th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided min/max range).


The provided alpha and beta analysis shows a volatile relationship with the market (high beta values) and significant periods of outperformance (high alpha values, especially in 2018-2020). However, there's also evidence of periods of substantial underperformance (negative alpha in 2020-2022). This highlights the importance of considering the risk profile associated with WWD's higher-than-market volatility.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 40.0% | 10.2% | 10.0% | 4.3 |
| 2016-2018  | 27.0% | 10.0% | 9.0% | 4.2 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $160.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $173.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $181.86
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $184.59

The price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.88 (from $157.29) represents a small positive change but needs to be viewed within the context of the larger downward trend indicated by the moving averages.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)  Indicates increased market volatility.
* **RSI:** 31.39 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce, but not confirming an upward trend)
* **PPO:** -1.58 (Negative value, further confirming bearish sentiment)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -10.3% (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return:** 4.3% (Long-term expected excess return over the S&P 500, but high risk needs to be carefully considered)


The recent price increase, while positive, is not significant enough to offset the overall bearish trend implied by the technical indicators and the moving average analysis.  The high risk assessment (MRI) warrants caution.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

WWD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. However, this outperformance is accompanied by high volatility (high beta) and periods of substantial underperformance.  Current technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, with the price trading below its moving averages.  The high market risk indicator and low RSI reinforce this. While the long-term expected return is positive,  the significant risk should be carefully weighed against the potential reward.  Further investigation into the drivers of past volatility and a more in-depth analysis of earnings and financial statements are necessary before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate earnings data) highlight the need for thorough data validation before drawing strong conclusions.
