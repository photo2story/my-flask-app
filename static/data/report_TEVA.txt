**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $14.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $15.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $17.30

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase of 1.01% (from $13.8 to $13.94) is a relatively small move within the context of the larger downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 14.33 –  Significantly oversold, suggesting potential for a bounce, but not necessarily a sustained uptrend.
* **PPO:** -0.95 –  Negative and below zero indicating a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +4.2 – Suggests a short-term upward movement.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.48 – Indicates a High Risk.
* **Expected Return:** -79.1% – This extremely negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 underscores the significant underperformance and high risk associated with TEVA.  Long-term investing (2+ years) in TEVA at this point carries substantial downside potential compared to a broadly diversified market index like the S&P 500.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEVA is currently showing significant underperformance compared to the broader market (VOO), supported by negative alpha and fluctuating beta. Technical indicators (RSI, PPO, MRI) point towards high risk and a bearish sentiment. Recent earnings reveal inconsistent profitability and negative EPS in several quarters.  The financial statements highlight declining profit margins and negative ROE.  While a recent price increase suggests potential short-term upward movement, the overall outlook remains extremely negative, and significant risk is associated with investing in TEVA at this time.  The projected return significantly lags the S&P 500, making it a poor investment compared to a market index fund.  Further investigation into the company's strategic direction and operational efficiency is crucial before considering any investment.
