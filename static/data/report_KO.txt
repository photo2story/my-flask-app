* **Closing Price:** $68.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $70.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $67.23

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change of -$2.23 indicates a noticeable decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **MRI:** 0.4792 (High Risk) –  Indicates a relatively high level of market risk.
* **RSI:** 46.11 –  Approaching oversold territory (below 50), but not significantly so.
* **PPO:** -0.2581 –  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** 13.9 (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -10.1% –  Suggests a potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This needs further investigation into the methodologies used to derive this figure. The significant price drop (-$2.23) should be considered alongside this expectation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

There's a duplication in the earnings data (2024-10-24 entry appears twice).  Assuming this is an error and using only one instance, the data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  Further analysis would require a longer timeframe and a comparison to previous years' performance to assess trends.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue     |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.66 | $11.85B     |
| 2024-07-29 | $0.56 | $12.36B     |
| 2024-05-02 | $0.74 | $11.30B     |
| 2023-10-24 | $0.71 | $11.95B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows consistent profitability with high profit margins (above 57%). Revenue fluctuates slightly but remains generally strong. ROE (Return on Equity) also shows some variation, potentially influenced by changes in equity.  A deeper analysis would be needed to assess the health and sustainability of these trends.

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity     | ROE  |
|-------------|------------|---------------|------------|------|
| 2024-12-31 | $11.54B    | 60.04%        | $24.86B    | 8.83% |
| 2024-09-30 | $11.85B    | 60.65%        | $26.52B    | 10.74%|
| 2024-06-30 | $12.36B    | 61.08%        | $25.85B    | 9.33% |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.30B    | 62.52%        | $26.43B    | 12.02%|
| 2023-12-31 | $10.85B    | 57.29%        | $25.94B    | 7.61% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola shows consistent profitability and a strong market position, but its recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500. The current price is below its moving averages, and the recent price drop coupled with a negative expected return and high market risk indicator raises concerns.  While the company's fundamentals seem relatively strong, investors should carefully consider the recent underperformance and the relatively high market risk before making any investment decisions.  Further research into the methodology behind the -10.1% expected return and a longer-term analysis of earnings and financial data would be beneficial.
