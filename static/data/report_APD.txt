**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $259.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $278.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $288.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $306.20

The price is significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The recent price drop of $1.66 (-0.63%) further supports this.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (20.22):**  Indicates the stock is significantly oversold, suggesting a potential bounce.  However, this should be considered in context with other indicators.
* **PPO (-0.90):** Shows a strong bearish signal.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +0.2, suggesting a short-term upward trend, potentially a temporary bounce within the larger bearish trend.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792, classifying the stock as high risk.
* **Expected Return (-19.2%):**  A negative expected return suggests a bearish outlook.  This should be interpreted carefully; a negative expected return doesn't mean the investment will lose money, it's a comparison to a benchmark and suggests underperformance relative to the S&P 500 for the foreseeable future.  The -19.2% figure indicates a significant underperformance expectation relative to the S&P 500.

The negative price change of $1.66 from the previous close reflects recent market sentiment. While the oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, the overall picture is bearish, considering the other indicators.  The  negative expected return of -19.2% highlights a potential for substantial underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

APD's recent performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500. While the company shows consistent profitability and a healthy financial position, the current market indicators (RSI, PPO, MRI) paint a bearish picture.  The negative expected return and the price being below all major moving averages reinforce this.  The high maximum drawdowns observed over various periods suggest considerable volatility.  While the oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce,  the long-term outlook warrants caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the unusually high ROE in Q3 2024 is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests that a long-term investment strategy may not outperform the S&P 500, as the expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative.
