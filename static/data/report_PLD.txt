**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $94.52
* **Previous Close:** $98.23
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $103.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $109.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $114.74

The price is significantly below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price drop of -$3.78 indicates a short-term negative trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 21.17 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.40 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.2% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return:** 206.7% (Long-term, over 2 years, exceeding S&P 500)

The technical indicators (RSI, PPO, MRI) suggest a bearish market sentiment and potentially oversold conditions.  The significant negative price change warrants attention and monitoring for potential short-term recovery or further decline.  The expected return is very high, but relies on the long-term potential of the company and the assumption that this high return will be maintained exceeding the S&P 500. This requires cautious consideration and further investigation of the basis for this high expected return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue    |

| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | $2.04 B    |

| 2024-07-26 | 0.93 | $2.01 B    |
| 2025-02-14 | 0.93 | $2.01 B    |

There is duplicated data in this table (2025-02-14 entries).  Assuming the duplicates are errors and using the unique data points, the EPS shows a generally upward trend. However, further analysis is needed due to inconsistent reporting and limited data.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Prologis shows strong revenue and profitability, indicated by high profit margins and steady revenue growth. However, the recent stock price performance lags the S&P 500, and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The provided expected return of 206.7% needs careful scrutiny due to its unusually high value, and more detailed supporting information is needed for verification.  The inconsistent and incomplete earnings data requires further clarification. Overall, while the fundamentals appear strong, the recent negative price momentum and some inconsistencies in the data provided warrant cautious monitoring before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the methodologies used for calculating alpha, the inconsistencies in the earnings data, and the basis for the high projected return is highly recommended.
