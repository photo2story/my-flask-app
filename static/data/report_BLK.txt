**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $817.5
* **Previous Close:** $822.62
* **Change:** -$0.62 (a slight decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $886.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $931.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $966.95

The stock price is trading significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a potential bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 17.95 (Oversold; generally below 30 indicates oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -1.43 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -5.9% (Short-term bearish trend)

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative expected return, coupled with the price trading below its moving averages and the high MRI, paints a concerning picture.  The recent price drop of -$0.62 reflects a modest negative change and does not suggest a significant market event (no 급반등 or 급하락).

The duplicate entry in the earnings data requires clarification.  The negative long-term expected return should be a significant factor in any investment decision.
