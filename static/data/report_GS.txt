## Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS) Stock Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS), a leading global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm, shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.  However, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  Further analysis is required to determine long-term investment viability.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

GS exhibited a cumulative return of 74.14%, exceeding the S&P 500's 73.15% return by 0.99%.  This represents a relative divergence of 65.1% based on historical range, indicating GS's performance is in the higher percentiles compared to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta) and significant periods of negative alpha (underperformance relative to the market), particularly between 2017 and 2020. More recent years (2021-2025) show positive alpha, suggesting outperformance.  However,  CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates considerably, highlighting the volatility inherent in GS's stock.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) generally shows an upward trend.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values indicate significant potential for large losses during market downturns.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Closing Price:** $465.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $511.82
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $543.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $594.37

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price change of -$1.13 (-0.24%) from the previous close suggests a slight downward movement, though not a significant drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk category). This suggests elevated market risk.

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.83. This is below 30, indicating oversold conditions, which could signal a potential short-term bounce. However, this is not a reliable indicator for longer-term trends.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.44. A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.

* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -13.4%. A negative value indicates a recent downward trend relative to the benchmark.

* **Expected Return:** -6.3%.  This suggests a negative expected return at the current juncture.  The statement mentions a positive long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 with continued investment.  This would need further clarification, including assumptions about future market performance, to be fully assessed.


**Conclusion:**

While GS has historically outperformed the S&P 500 in certain periods, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook. The high market risk indicator and negative expected return warrant caution.  The long-term outlook requires further analysis of the assumptions underpinning the projected S&P 500 outperformance.  Investors should consider the high volatility and potential for significant losses before making any investment decisions.
