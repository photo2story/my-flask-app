**1) Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

GOOG significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return exceeding VOO by 40.65%. The provided alpha and beta data show varying results across different time periods. While some periods exhibit negative alpha (underperformance relative to the market), others show substantial positive alpha, indicating periods of significant outperformance.  The beta consistently remains above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) steadily increased, reflecting the company's growth.

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change of $1.02 (147.74 to 149.24) is a relatively small increase; hence, it does not indicate a significant price change(i.e. 급반등 or 급하락).

* **Relative Strength Divergence (20-day):** +6.2 (Short-term upward momentum)

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

GOOG exhibits strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  However, the high MRI value suggests a degree of market risk.  Recent price action shows a downward trend relative to moving averages, and technical indicators are mixed, with RSI suggesting oversold conditions.  While earnings demonstrate a clear upward trajectory, the data discrepancy from October 2023 requires further investigation.  The high projected long-term return (88.3%) relative to the S&P 500 is attractive but should be considered within the context of the inherent market risks.  Further due diligence and analysis are recommended before making any investment decisions.
