The large difference and relatively high relative divergence suggest substantial outperformance, though this past performance is not indicative of future results.  The provided alpha and beta data show a highly volatile stock with periods of significant losses and gains, and a high beta indicating higher risk than the market.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

* **Closing Price:** $77.84
* **Previous Close:** $74.01
* **Daily Change:** $5.17 (7.0% increase - significant daily jump)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $81.52
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $85.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $88.46

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend or at least a period of consolidation.  The recent significant daily increase needs further investigation to determine sustainability.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.36 (Slightly below neutral; not oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.33 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.6% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -10.1% (compared to S&P 500) - This suggests that even with long-term investment, the expected return of PLTR might be lower than the S&P 500. This requires further analysis and interpretation to properly factor risk and potential.

The recent price increase of $5.17, combined with a high MRI and negative PPO, suggests a potentially volatile situation. While the RSI isn't deeply oversold, the other indicators hint at caution.  The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 indicates lower expected returns in the long run if the current trend and forecasts continue.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown remarkable growth compared to the S&P 500, but this performance is characterized by high volatility and significant risk (high beta, high MRI).  Recent price action shows a sharp increase followed by a pullback below moving averages.  While revenue is growing and profit margins are high, some key financial metrics (ROE) show some decline. The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 and negative PPO suggest caution.  A thorough analysis of the duplicate earnings data and a deeper dive into the drivers of ROE fluctuations are necessary before making any investment decisions.  Given the volatility and significant risk, a well-diversified portfolio approach is recommended for any investment in PLTR.
