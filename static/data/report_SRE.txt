Sempra (SRE) shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish sentiment, supported by the recent price drop and moving averages.

Further investigation into the factors driving the significant underperformance and the extremely low predicted return is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The volatility in earnings and revenue also warrants closer examination.  More historical data and a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals are needed for a more comprehensive assessment.
