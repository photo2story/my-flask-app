## TEM (Unknown Company) Stock Report

**Summary of Key Figures:**

* **Cumulative Return (TEM):** -1.94%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** -29.61%
* **Current Price:** $42.70
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.48 (High Risk)


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Unknown Company (TEM) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While VOO experienced a substantial loss of -29.61%, TEM only declined by -1.94%. The relative divergence, calculated against the historical range of divergence between TEM and VOO, is 46.4%, indicating that the current outperformance is relatively high compared to past observations.

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows a negative alpha (-0.0) suggesting that TEM has not generated excess returns beyond what would be expected given its beta. The high beta (7.3) indicates a high sensitivity to market movements.  The negative CAGR of -2.0% is concerning, but the recent outperformance against the S&P 500 should be considered.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) of 80.3% highlights significant downside risk.  The small market capitalization (Cap(B)) also suggests higher volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $42.70
* **5-day moving average:** $45.71
* **20-day moving average:** $48.54
* **60-day moving average:** $54.63

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent small price increase of $0.28 is not enough to suggest a trend reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.77 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.14 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +4.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** Not provided. The high beta and negative CAGR indicate high risk and thus make prediction of future returns very challenging.


The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.48 suggests a high-risk investment.  The recent price increase is small, and  given the other negative indicators, it is unlikely a significant reversal of the overall downtrend.  Long-term (2+ years) investment in TEM requires careful consideration of its high volatility and risk profile. The possibility of outperforming the S&P 500 in the long term is difficult to assess based on the provided data alone.

| 2023-12-31  | $-1.38B     | 3.65%         |

Extremely volatile and largely negative Return on Equity (ROE)  raises significant concerns about the company's financial health.  Negative equity in several quarters is a major red flag.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TEM has shown short-term outperformance against the S&P 500, but this is against the backdrop of a significantly negative CAGR and high volatility.  The company's financial health is concerning, indicated by negative EPS, volatile profit margins, and alarmingly negative ROE and equity in several quarters. The high beta and MDD indicate considerable risk.  While the recent price movement suggests a slight upward trend,  the overall picture is negative, and significant caution is advised before considering any investment in TEM.  Further investigation into the company's business model and future prospects is strongly recommended.
