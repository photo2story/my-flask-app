## PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

PPG Industries Inc. is a leading global manufacturer and supplier of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.  Recent performance shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, characterized by negative returns and concerning financial indicators.  Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying causes and potential future performance.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PPG's cumulative return of -22.10% significantly lags the S&P 500's 73.15% return, resulting in a large divergence (-95.2%). The relative divergence of -14.4% places PPG at the lower end of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance. While periods of strong positive alpha exist (2017-2019, for example),  recent years (2022-2025) show dramatically negative CAGR and significantly high beta values, indicating a higher sensitivity to market fluctuations than the S&P 500. The high and volatile beta suggests substantial risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $96.93
* **Previous Close:** $99.15
* **Daily Change:** -$2.24 (a -2.26% decrease) indicating a recent downward trend.
* **5-day Moving Average:** $103.83
* **20-day Moving Average:** $109.63
* **60-day Moving Average:** $114.02

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting bearish momentum. The recent price drop of $2.24 warrants further investigation into potential causes.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk) indicating elevated market uncertainty.
* **RSI:** 19.92 (Oversold territory; potentially signaling a bounce, but not necessarily a sustained uptrend)
* **PPO:** -1.21 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +8.3% (Short-term upward movement, potentially a temporary bounce)
* **Expected Return:** -312.1% (This extremely negative value requires careful scrutiny; the methodology for calculating this figure should be reviewed as it's highly improbable.  The large negative number is likely indicative of a significant issue in the calculation, rather than a genuine prediction.)

The combination of a high MRI, oversold RSI, negative PPO, and a significant recent price drop points towards a bearish outlook, but the -312.1% expected return needs further clarification.  The large daily negative change supports concerns about the current trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PPG's recent performance is alarming. The stock's substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, coupled with negative expected return (requiring further investigation into its calculation), declining ROE, and high market risk, paints a bearish picture.  The recent price drop and bearish technical indicators further strengthen this outlook. While some quarters show strong profitability, the current trend is worrying.  Further investigation is needed to understand the causes of the recent downturn and whether this is a temporary correction or a more significant long-term issue.  Before any investment decisions are made, a thorough assessment of the company's future outlook, including potential catalysts for recovery, is necessary.  The significant volatility and high beta of the stock indicate considerable risk.
