**1) Company Overview and Performance Analysis:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The provided data shows COIN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return difference of 14.8% suggests COIN's superior performance. The relative divergence of 33.7% places this outperformance in the upper third of its historical range against VOO. However, the high variability in alpha and beta across the periods suggests considerable volatility in its performance relative to the market.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 81.0% | 66.1% | 78.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 128.0% | 73.9% | 108.0% | 0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 59.0% | 73.9% | 45.0% | 0.1 | 39.9 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $157.28
* **Previous Close:** $160.55
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $169.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $183.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $233.89

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price drop of $2.04 further supports this observation.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.11 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.65 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.4 (Short-term upward momentum, but this conflicts with the negative PPO and moving average trends)
* **Expected Return:** 0.8% (This is a relatively low expected return and needs further context.  It's crucial to understand the timeframe and assumptions behind this figure, particularly its relation to the high risk indicated by MRI).

The recent price drop of $2.04 from the previous close indicates a short-term downward correction, however, the short-term upward momentum signaled by relative divergence warrants further investigation.  The discrepancy between the short-term indicators and the longer-term trends needs clarification.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30  | $1.21B      |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15  | $1.45B      |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84  | $1.64B      |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01 | $0.67B      |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01 | $0.67B      |


There is significant variability in EPS and inconsistent data (two entries for 2024-10-30).  The high EPS in May 2024 is an outlier requiring investigation for potential one-time events or accounting anomalies.  Overall, earnings show instability, further supporting the high-risk assessment.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.27B | 75.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.28B | 12.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86% |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35% |

Revenue shows some volatility but generally trending upwards. Profit margins are consistently high.  ROE also shows volatility, suggesting fluctuating profitability.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers behind these variations.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase (COIN) has demonstrated strong outperformance against the S&P 500 in the given period.  However, this outperformance is characterized by high volatility, as indicated by the inconsistent alpha and beta values and the highly variable earnings data.  The high market risk indicator (MRI) and mixed technical indicators (RSI approaching oversold, but negative PPO and price below moving averages) paint a picture of a high-risk, potentially volatile investment.  The low expected return further emphasizes the need for caution.  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the causes of earnings volatility and the drivers behind the short-term upward momentum is strongly recommended.  The data presented indicates substantial risk, and investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in COIN.
