The provided alpha and beta values show fluctuating performance relative to the market.  While some periods (2017-2020) exhibited high alpha (outperformance), recent years display negative CAGR and increasing beta, suggesting increased market sensitivity and underperformance.

The stock price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price drop (-2.56) reflects a short-term negative trend.

The negative equity and ROE values are concerning and require further investigation into the company's balance sheet and financial health.  These negative values are likely related to accounting practices and should be further explored.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Starbucks currently exhibits a bearish outlook.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, showing negative CAGR in recent years and high sensitivity to market movements (high Beta). Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the negative expected return and concerning financial metrics (negative equity and ROE) raise significant concerns.  Before considering an investment, a thorough investigation into the reasons for the negative equity and ROE, along with a more comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health and future prospects, is crucial.  The provided data alone does not justify a long-term investment at this time.
