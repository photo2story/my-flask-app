The negative expected return further dampens the outlook for long-term investors. The high market risk indicator reinforces the need for caution. Before considering any investment,  further investigation into the discrepancies in the provided earnings data and a deeper analysis of the underlying reasons for the stock's underperformance are crucial.  The current situation suggests that UPS is a high-risk investment at this time.
