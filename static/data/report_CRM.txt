## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**  Salesforce, a cloud-based software company, shows significant divergence from the S&P 500, currently underperforming. While exhibiting strong revenue growth, recent performance is characterized by high volatility and a relatively low RSI, suggesting potential oversold conditions but also substantial risk.  Long-term investment requires careful consideration of its high beta and market risk.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) has accumulated a return of 34.15%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) with a return of 73.15%.  The current divergence is -39.0%, placing it at the 16.9th percentile of its historical range (max: 108.2%, min: -69.0%).

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows high volatility and significant market sensitivity (high beta).  While CAGR has been strong in some periods (reaching 59%),  recent years show substantial negative returns (-100% in 2020-2022, -38% in 2021-2023), coupled with high maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The high alpha in recent years (2021-2025) indicates potential outperformance but should be interpreted cautiously given the high risk profile.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 38.0% | 13.2% | 8.0%  | -0.0 | 97.7 |
| 2016-2018  | 59.0% | 12.7% | 40.0% | 0.1 | 130.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 59.0% | 12.7% | 28.0% | 0.7 | 155.4 |
| 2018-2020  | 56.0% | 18.0% | 25.0% | 0.5 | 212.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 42.0% | 18.0% | -32.0% | 0.5 | 242.9 |
| 2020-2022  | -100.0% | 18.0% | -110.0%| 0.8 | 126.7 |
| 2021-2023  | -38.0% | 60.0% | -59.0% | 3.0 | 251.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -8.0% | 69.3% | -28.0% | 3.2 | 321.3 |
| 2023-2025  | 23.0% | 69.3% | 9.0%  | 2.0 | 234.7 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $244.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $256.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $273.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $304.96

The stock price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The recent price change of $1.43 (a small percentage increase) is not enough to overcome the longer-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 24.71 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.93 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -127.3% (This suggests a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, but the negative value needs clarification. Is this a forecast or a historical result?)


The low RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, potentially presenting a buying opportunity for long-term investors, but the high MRI indicates significant risk.  The recent price increase is minimal and doesn't significantly alter the bearish outlook. The extremely negative expected return warrants further investigation and clarification.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Salesforce shows relatively consistent revenue growth but EPS figures show some variation. Further analysis is needed to understand if this variation is seasonal or indicative of larger trends.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce presents a complex investment case.  While revenue growth is positive and profit margins are strong, the stock's significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high volatility, high beta, and a high market risk indicator raise significant concerns.  The oversold RSI might suggest a buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high-risk tolerance, but the substantial negative expected return and historical volatility demand careful consideration.  A thorough fundamental analysis, including an examination of the competitive landscape and future growth prospects, is crucial before making any investment decision.  Clarification is needed on the -127.3% expected return figure.
