## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

DOGE-USD, commonly known as Dogecoin, is a cryptocurrency and a meme-based peer-to-peer digital currency.  The provided data shows significant volatility and outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), though this is highly dependent on the chosen timeframe.  Current indicators suggest the asset is trading below its short- and medium-term moving averages and has a low RSI, indicating potential for a further price decrease, however this is only one signal and is not a definite indication of the next price move.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 3000.15%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 50.98%
* **Return Difference:** 2949.17%  (This indicates significantly higher returns for DOGE-USD compared to the S&P 500. However, this large difference is dependent upon a long period of extreme volatility, as demonstrated by the differing alpha and beta figures over different timeframes).
* **Relative Divergence:** 12.4% (This signifies DOGE-USD's current performance lies within the top 12.4% of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500, indicating exceptional but potentially unsustainable outperformance).

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis highlights extreme volatility in DOGE-USD's performance, significantly exceeding the S&P 500's returns in several periods but also showing substantial negative returns in others. The high beta values indicate significant sensitivity to market movements, amplifying both gains and losses.  The consistently low alpha values suggest that the outperformance largely comes from market timing, not outperforming the market once risk is considered.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.1509
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.1604
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.1718
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.2023

The price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)  This suggests a high level of risk associated with investing in DOGE-USD.
* **RSI:** 32.89 (Below 30, considered oversold)  This indicates that the asset may be oversold, however this signal could also persist with further falls in price.
* **PPO:** -0.56 (Negative, suggesting a bearish trend)  This further confirms the bearish trend signal provided by other indicators.
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** -1.4 (Negative, short-term downward trend) This signal highlights the recent short-term drop in the relative divergence, further confirming the downward trend.
* **Price Change:** 1.34% increase from the previous day.  This is a small daily increase, not a significant 'sudden' or extreme movement.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 18713.8%  This extraordinary expected return, compared to the S&P 500, highlights the potential for extremely high gains, but also underscores the high-risk nature of the investment, especially with regards to the huge volatility of the asset in the past, meaning the high expected return is not certain.  This extremely high number should be carefully considered against the warnings provided by the risk indicator.

**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has demonstrated extraordinary returns in certain periods, far exceeding the S&P 500. However, this performance is characterized by high volatility and substantial risk, as evidenced by the high beta, low alpha, and high MRI. Current indicators point to a potential bearish trend.  Investors should exercise extreme caution, thoroughly understand the risks involved, and proceed with a high tolerance for volatility before investing in this asset. The extremely high long-term expected return should be viewed with skepticism, given its sensitivity to market conditions.
