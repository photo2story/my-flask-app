The data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in most years, but significant volatility, especially in 2020-2023 with negative CAGRs and high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  The beta increased significantly in recent years, indicating increased market sensitivity.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix shows a strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but recent performance indicates higher risk (MRI).  While revenue and profitability are generally positive, the company's price is currently below key moving averages, and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend in the short term. The high volatility and significant changes in beta highlight the need for cautious consideration. Long-term prospects seem somewhat positive based on the provided expected return, but further analysis, including a deeper dive into the earnings and financial information, along with examination of broader market conditions, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The provided data suggests a potentially high-risk, high-reward situation, and investors should carefully weigh these factors against their own risk tolerance and investment goals.  The inconsistent alpha values further emphasize this volatility.
