**6) Overall Analysis:**

ADSK's recent performance is concerning, showing significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  While profitability remains strong and revenue continues to grow, the negative price action, low RSI, high MRI, and projected future underperformance (-56.8%) raise serious concerns.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity, amplifying both gains and losses.  Further analysis is needed to determine the causes of the recent underperformance and to assess the long-term viability of ADSK as an investment. The duplicate entry in the earnings data needs clarification.  A thorough examination of the reasons behind the fluctuating ROE and the projected large negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.
