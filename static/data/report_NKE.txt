**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent with itself (Two entries for 2025-04-03). Assuming the duplicate entry is an error, and using one entry for 2025-04-03, we observe a decline in both EPS and revenue in the most recent quarters, potentially indicating weakening financial performance.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2025-04-03 | 0.54 | $11.27B        |
| 2025-01-03 | 0.78 | $12.35B        |
| 2024-10-07 | 0.70 | $11.59B        |
| 2024-04-04 | 0.77 | $12.43B        |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some fluctuation, but a general downward trend in the last two quarters is apparent. Profit margins have also decreased over the period.  ROE (Return on Equity) has been relatively high and consistent, except for a drop in Q1 2025.


| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-02-28  | $11.27B    | 41.49%        |
| 2024-11-30  | $12.35B    | 43.62%        |
| 2024-08-31  | $11.59B    | 45.36%        |
| 2024-05-31  | $12.61B    | 44.69%        |
| 2024-02-29  | $12.43B    | 44.75%        |

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE           |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-02-28  | $14.01B    | 5.67%         |
| 2024-11-30  | $14.04B    | 8.29%         |
| 2024-08-31  | $13.94B    | 7.54%         |
| 2024-05-31  | $14.43B    | 10.40%        |
| 2024-02-29  | $14.23B    | 8.24%         |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance is concerning.  While the stock is technically oversold (RSI), the negative return relative to the S&P 500, decreasing revenue and profit margins, and increasing Beta, all signal significant risk.  The high ROE suggests some underlying strength, but the negative outlook and market risk make a long-term investment decision complex. Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent financial performance decline, and a thorough review of the competitive landscape and future growth prospects are needed before making any investment decisions.  The -51.5% expected return highlights substantial underperformance expectations compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This analysis suggests caution is warranted.
