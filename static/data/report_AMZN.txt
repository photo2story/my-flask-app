## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**0) Overview:** Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Amazon's cumulative return (82.55%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (73.15%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 9.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 19.0% indicates that Amazon's performance is in the upper percentiles relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance over different time periods.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is generally high, particularly from 2018-2020 (84%),  the period from 2020-2023 shows significant negative returns (-110% and -115%). This highlights the inherent volatility of the stock. Beta values increase significantly from 2021, suggesting increasing sensitivity to market movements during this period.  High maximum drawdowns (MDD) also underscore the risk associated with this investment. The market cap, however, shows continuous growth throughout the period.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

The stock closed at $175.26, up $2.49 from the previous close.  This represents a short-term upward trend, however, it's significantly below its 5-day ($182.57), 20-day ($193.49), and 60-day ($213.61) moving averages, suggesting a bearish momentum in the short to medium term.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792, indicating a high-risk environment.
* **RSI:** 36.49, suggesting the stock is in oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -0.9387, a negative value indicating bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength:** Recent positive change (+1.1) in relative divergence points to short-term upward momentum.
* **Price Change:** The price increase of $2.49 suggests a potential bounce-back, but further monitoring is necessary.  It's not a significant "sharp rebound".
* **Expected Return:** A 65.4% expected return over a long-term (2+ years) horizon against the S&P 500 suggests significant outperformance potential, but this is highly speculative and depends on many factors.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings per share (EPS) and revenue have shown a general upward trend, though the recent quarters haven't shown explosive growth.  Note the duplicate entry for 2024-11-01.

**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue growth shows some fluctuations but generally an upward trend. Profit margins have remained relatively stable around 19% in recent quarters.  Equity and ROE (Return on Equity) are also trending upwards, although ROE shows some variability.  These indicators suggest a generally healthy financial position, but the high level of debt should be considered.

**6) Summary:**

Amazon shows a strong long-term growth potential, reflected in its historical outperformance against the S&P 500. However, the stock exhibits considerable volatility, as evidenced by significant drawdowns and fluctuating alpha/beta values. Recent price action suggests a possible short-term rebound from oversold conditions, but the stock trades below its key moving averages.  Financials are generally strong, but the high-risk environment and recent negative returns warrant caution.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and long-term investment horizon before investing in AMZN. The high expected return is purely speculative and depends on future market conditions.  Further in-depth due diligence is strongly recommended.
