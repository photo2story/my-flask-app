The data shows inconsistent performance, with periods of strong outperformance and significant underperformance relative to the market (Alpha). Beta generally hovers around 0.5, suggesting moderate market sensitivity.  The recent negative CAGR is concerning.


**2) Recent Price Movements:**

PEP's current price ($143.19) is below all three moving averages (5-day: $147.99, 20-day: $148.40, 60-day: $148.04), indicating a bearish short-term trend. The recent price change (-$2.33) reflects a noticeable drop.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI (36.76) suggests the stock may be oversold, potentially indicating a bounce.  The negative PPO (-0.25) confirms bearish momentum. The recent increase in relative divergence (+13.1%) hints at a short-term upward trend, but this is contradicted by the negative PPO and the price being below all moving averages. The high MRI (0.48) indicates high market risk.  The projected long-term underperformance (-19.2% relative to the S&P 500) is a significant concern.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | 23.32 B$    |
| 2024-07-11 | 2.24 | 22.50 B$    |

| 2024-10-08 | 2.25 | 23.45 B$    | *(Duplicate Entry?)*


There's a duplicate entry in the earnings data.  EPS and revenue show some fluctuation; a more detailed analysis would require additional data points.  Revenue appears to be seasonally impacted.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PEP's recent performance has been weak relative to the S&P 500. While some indicators (RSI) might suggest an oversold condition and a potential short-term rebound, the negative PPO, the price being below its moving averages, the high Market Risk Indicator and the projected long-term underperformance raise significant concerns.  The inconsistency in Alpha and Beta, combined with the fluctuating earnings and financial data, points to a need for more in-depth fundamental analysis to determine whether the current low valuation represents a buying opportunity or reflects deeper underlying issues.  The negative long-term expected return is a key factor to consider.  Before making any investment decisions, further research is strongly recommended.
