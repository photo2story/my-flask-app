## Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) is a leading cybersecurity company providing network security, cloud security, and endpoint security solutions.  PANW has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a considerably higher cumulative return. However, recent price action suggests a potential pullback.  Further analysis is needed to determine the long-term investment viability.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PANW's cumulative return of 256.88% vastly exceeds the S&P 500's 73.15% return.  The relative divergence of 65.7% indicates PANW's performance is significantly above the S&P 500 compared to its historical range.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly variable results year-over-year.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been consistently high in recent years, Alpha (risk-adjusted return) fluctuates, suggesting exposure to market risk (high Beta values in some periods).  Market cap has also increased significantly over the years. This suggests that while PANW has shown strong growth, its performance is not entirely independent of broader market movements.
