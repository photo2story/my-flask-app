The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with higher cumulative returns and a generally positive outlook, although recent price action suggests some potential near-term weakness.  However, the company's long-term prospects appear solid.

* **Closing Price:** $83.83
* **5-day Moving Average:** $86.57
* **20-day Moving Average:** $86.03
* **60-day Moving Average:** $93.24

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  The recent price increase of $0.77 (from $83.19) is relatively small compared to the overall trend.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.00 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.21 (Positive, but relatively low, suggesting less momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +2.9 (Short-term upward pressure)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 5.0% (long-term, 2+ years)

The MRI suggests a relatively high level of risk.  While RSI is near oversold levels, it's not a strong buy signal alone. The PPO is positive but weak. The positive change in relative strength suggests some short-term upward momentum, but the price is still below its moving averages indicating potential for further downside. The expected return suggests potential outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Walmart (WMT) has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Its consistent profitability and growing equity are positive signs.

Despite this, the long-term outlook, supported by the expected return and generally positive financial indicators, remains relatively strong.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy, with consideration of the inherent risk, appears to be a reasonable approach.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data entry is recommended.
