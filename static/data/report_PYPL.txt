**1) Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. is a multinational financial technology company operating online payments systems.  PYPL's cumulative return of -35.6% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's 73.8% return, resulting in a substantial difference of -109.4%.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility and inconsistent performance. While periods of high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) are present (notably 2018-2020),  recent years (2020-2025) show substantial negative returns and high maximum drawdown (MDD).  The beta fluctuates, but generally indicates significant market sensitivity.  The sharply negative alpha in 2023-2025 suggests considerable underperformance relative to the market.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 70.0% | 3.4% | 44.0% | 0.1 | 72.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 65.0% | 9.3% | 46.0% | 0.1 | 83.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 83.0% | 9.3% | 53.0% | 0.6 | 107.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 192.0% | 9.3% | 161.0% | 0.4 | 231.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 105.0% | 20.5% | 31.0% | 0.3 | 186.6 |
| 2020-2022  | -118.0% | 62.6% | -128.0% | 0.5 | 70.5 |
| 2021-2023  | -315.0% | 62.6% | -336.0% | 1.1 | 60.8 |
| 2022-2024  | -158.0% | 70.2% | -178.0% | 0.4 | 84.4 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $58.53
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.37
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $67.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.77

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The small positive daily change (+$0.27) is not significant enough to suggest a reversal of the downtrend.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (23.48):**  Deeply oversold, suggesting potential for a bounce but not necessarily a sustained uptrend.
* **PPO (-1.19):**  Significantly negative, confirming bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +2.7%, indicating short-term upward pressure, but this is minor considering the overall trend.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.48 suggests a high-risk investment.
* **Expected Return:** -885.1%  This extremely negative figure suggests a highly pessimistic outlook, but further clarification on the calculation method is needed. The statement about long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is contradicted by the negative expected return.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.19    | 1.11          | +0.08      |
| 2024-10-29 | 1.20    | 1.07          | +0.13      |
| 2024-07-30 | 1.19    | 0.99          | +0.20      |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.40    | 1.22          | +0.18      |
| 2024-02-07 | 1.48    | 1.36          | +0.12      |

While EPS has consistently exceeded expectations recently, this positive trend isn't sufficient to offset the overall negative performance.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $8.37       | 47.04%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.85       | 46.57%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.88       | 45.76%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $7.70       | 44.95%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $8.03       | 45.75%        |

Revenue has been relatively stable, but profit margin shows a slight downward trend, suggesting potential pressure on profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $20.42      | 5.49    |
| 2024-09-30 | $20.17      | 5.01    |
| 2024-06-30 | $20.62      | 5.47    |
| 2024-03-31 | $20.70      | 4.29    |
| 2023-12-31 | $21.05      | 6.66    |

Equity and ROE show some fluctuation, but no clear trend.  The ROE is relatively low compared to other sectors.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PayPal is currently experiencing significant underperformance compared to the broader market.  While recent earnings have beaten expectations and the company maintains substantial revenue and a relatively high profit margin, the stock price reflects significant investor concern. The highly negative expected return and the high market risk indicator highlight the substantial risk involved.  The oversold RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, but the negative PPO and downtrend in moving averages signal a bearish outlook.  A long-term investment requires careful consideration of the company's ability to overcome current challenges and improve its market performance, given the historical volatility and recent negative returns.  The -885.1% expected return needs clarification and should be treated with extreme caution, as it contradicts other findings.  Further research into the specific drivers of the negative expected return and their validity is critical before making investment decisions.
