## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

GE's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price movements show GE trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential downside pressure.  Technical indicators (RSI, PPO) point towards oversold conditions.  Earnings show growth in revenue and EPS, though with some quarter-to-quarter volatility.  Profit margins and ROE show fluctuation but overall positive trend.  The Market Risk Indicator suggests a relatively high-risk profile.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

General Electric Co is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors.

* **GE Cumulative Return:** 103.94%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 73.15%
* **Return Difference:** 30.8% (This is significantly above the minimum difference in historical data based on the provided relative divergence.)
* **Relative Divergence Rank:** 91.3% (This indicates GE's outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is in the top 91.3% of historical observations)

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly variable Alpha and Beta across different periods.  While recent periods (2022-2025) show positive Alpha and significant outperformance, earlier periods show negative Alpha and substantial underperformance relative to the market (high Beta values). This highlights the considerable volatility and risk associated with GE's stock.  The significant fluctuation in Beta suggests sensitivity to market movements varies considerably depending on the period being considered.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -30.0% | 14.0% | -60.0% | 0.1 | 84.3 |
| 2016-2018  | -73.0% | 21.3% | -91.0% | 0.0 | 37.6 |
| 2017-2019  | -38.0% | 21.3% | -0.1 | 57.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 15.0% | 27.7% | -0.2 | 56.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 34.0% | 27.7% | -0.3 | 61.8 |
| 2020-2022  | 2.0% | 27.7% | -0.5 | 55.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 70.0% | 17.4% | -1.4 | 107.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 112.0% | 63.3% | -0.5 | 177.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $167.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $185.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $197.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $197.64

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The price has recently increased slightly (0.53), potentially indicating a temporary bounce, but it is still substantially below the averages.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 25.90 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -2.12 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.5% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -13.2%

The low RSI and negative PPO suggest oversold conditions, potentially indicating a buying opportunity for some investors. However, the negative expected return and high MRI suggest significant risk. The recent small price increase is not significant enough to counteract the bearish trend indicated by other factors.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistencies, with duplicate entries.  Assuming duplicates are errors, revenue and EPS appear to be trending upward, but with some quarter-to-quarter variability. Further investigation is needed to understand the nature of the data duplication.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-02-03 | 1.76 | $9.88B      |
| 2024-10-22 | 1.71 | $8.94B      |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.16 | $8.22B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability show a somewhat inconsistent trend. Revenue shows an increasing trend except for the recent quarter. While the profit margin is higher in some quarters, it doesn't always correspond with higher revenue. Similar inconsistencies are observed in Equity and ROE.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.81B | 37.45% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.84B | 36.74% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.09B | 38.69% |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.05B | 27.61% |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.42B | 25.88% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $19.34B | 9.82% |
| 2024-09-30 | $18.87B | 9.81% |
| 2024-06-30 | $18.60B | 6.81% |
| 2024-03-31 | $29.86B | 5.15% |
| 2023-12-31 | $27.40B | 5.81% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE's stock has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 in the long term, but this performance has been highly volatile.  Current technical indicators suggest oversold conditions and potential downside risk. Although the recent earnings show growth, the inconsistent financial data warrants further investigation.  The negative expected return and high Market Risk Indicator highlight a significant risk profile.  Investors considering GE should carefully weigh the potential for future growth against the inherent volatility and risk.  More data and a deeper analysis are needed for a complete and conclusive assessment.  The inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate earnings entries, volatile financial metrics) limit the confidence of this analysis.
