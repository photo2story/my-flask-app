## Merck & Co Inc (MRK) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

* **Cumulative Return (MRK):** 28.29%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 73.15%
* **Return Difference (MRK vs VOO):** -44.9%
* **Relative Return Rank:** 34.2% (This means MRK's performance relative to VOO is better than 34.2% of the historical period observed for this metric.)


**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Merck & Co Inc is a leading pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, and manufacturing of prescription medicines.  Over the observed period, MRK significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), lagging by 44.9%.  While this appears negative, the relative return rank suggests that this underperformance is not entirely unusual compared to historical periods.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across the years.  Alpha, representing excess return over the market, shows positive values in most years (except 2019-2021 and 2023-2025), indicating periods of outperformance. Beta, measuring market sensitivity,  remains relatively stable around 0.3-0.5, suggesting moderate market correlation.  However, the extreme negative CAGR in the 2023-2025 period needs further investigation. The significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values also point to considerable risk associated with the investment.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $81.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $84.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $90.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $91.51

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downward trend.  The recent price change of -$0.36 reflects a minor decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 15.74 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.23 (Negative momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +12.1 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -11.9% (Long-term S&P 500 underperformance is predicted.)


The low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum.  However, the positive relative divergence hints at a potential short-term price rebound. The negative expected return underlines the current underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The negative price change of -$0.36 doesn't indicate a significant event (no sharp drop or rebound).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue. While revenue has generally been consistent above $15B, EPS experienced a drop in the latest quarter (2024-11-06) compared to the preceding quarter.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind this variation. Note there is a duplication of data for 2024-11-06.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.25 | $16.66 B      |
| 2024-08-05 | 2.15 | $16.11 B      |
| 2024-05-03 | 1.88 | $15.78 B      |
| 2023-11-03 | 1.87 | $15.96 B      |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.87 | $15.96 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows strong revenue and profit margins, consistently above 75%.  Equity has also grown steadily. However, ROE (Return on Equity) experienced a significant drop in 2023-12-31 before recovering in subsequent quarters. This volatility needs further examination.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.62B | 75.50%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $16.66B | 75.51%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.11B | 76.76%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $15.78B | 77.56%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $14.63B | 73.26%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE     |
|---------|----------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $46.31B | 8.08%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $44.50B | 7.09%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $43.58B | 12.52%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $40.36B | 11.80%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $37.58B | -3.26%  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

MRK currently shows a high-risk profile (MRI) and negative momentum (PPO).  While the company boasts strong revenue and profit margins, the recent underperformance against the S&P 500 and volatile ROE raise concerns. The negative expected return suggests that long-term investment in MRK may not outperform the broader market.  Further investigation into the causes of the recent EPS drop and the 2023-2025 period's negative CAGR is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests caution, and thorough due diligence, including analyzing the company's future prospects and strategic initiatives, is recommended.
