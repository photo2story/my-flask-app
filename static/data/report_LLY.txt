**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4792 (High Risk)  This indicates elevated market risk.

The current market conditions (shown by the price drop and oversold RSI) warrant caution in solely relying on this expectation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has demonstrated exceptionally high historical returns compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent price movements and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction.  While long-term prospects appear strong due to the high expected return and generally healthy financials, the elevated market risk and recent price decline necessitate caution.  Further investigation into the causes of the recent price drop and the duplicated earnings data entry is needed before making investment decisions.  The high beta value suggests LLY's performance is highly correlated with market fluctuations, meaning investors should be prepared for increased volatility.
