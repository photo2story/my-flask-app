**1. Performance Analysis:**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency.  BKNG significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return of 141.51% compared to VOO's 73.15%.  The 68.36% difference places BKNG at the 86.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO. This suggests a strong historical outperformance, but it doesn't guarantee future returns.

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows periods of significant outperformance (Alpha > 0) and underperformance (Alpha < 0) relative to the market.  The high Beta values in recent years (2021-2025) suggest BKNG is highly sensitive to market fluctuations, amplifying both gains and losses.  The market capitalization has also substantially increased during this period.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 23.0% | 16.5% | -6.0% | 0.1 | 56.4 |
| 2016-2018  | 24.0% | 9.0% | 6.0% | 0.4 | 55.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 8.0% | 10.7% | -23.0% | 0.9 | 66.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 6.0% | 18.7% | -25.0% | -0.0 | 72.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 24.0% | 18.7% | -50.0% | -0.3 | 77.9 |
| 2020-2022  | 10.0% | 66.8% | 1.0% | -0.2 | 65.4 |
| 2021-2023  | 95.0% | 66.8% | 74.0% | 2.1 | 115.1 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

BKNG's price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent closing price shows a decrease of $39.34 from the previous close, indicating a potential short-term bearish sentiment.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 38.77 is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce. However, the negative PPO (-0.67) indicates bearish momentum. The recent relative divergence (-0.8) confirms a short-term downward trend.  The MRI of 0.48 suggests a medium to high risk level.  The expected return of -0.9% reflects the recent price decline.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy could potentially yield an excess return over the S&P 500, given BKNG's historical outperformance, but this is not guaranteed given the high Beta.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently exceeded expected EPS in recent quarters.  The substantial beat in Q4 2024 is particularly noteworthy. This positive trend suggests strong underlying financial health.

| 날짜       | EPS    | 예상 EPS | EPS Surprise |

**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data was provided.  A complete financial analysis cannot be conducted without this critical information.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, the recent price decline, bearish technical indicators, and high Beta suggest caution. While the company's recent earnings have been impressive, the lack of revenue and gross profit data limits a comprehensive assessment.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and a thorough review of the company's financials are crucial before making any investment decision.  The high relative divergence suggests a potential mean reversion risk.  Long-term investors should consider the significant market risk and volatility associated with BKNG.
