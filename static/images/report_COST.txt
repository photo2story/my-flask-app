**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Costco Wholesale Corp is a multinational corporation that operates a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs.  The provided data shows significantly higher returns for COST compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Further analysis will delve into the drivers of this outperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **COST Cumulative Return:** 268.57%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 55.94%
* **Return Difference:** 212.6%  (This indicates COST significantly outperformed VOO.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 94.1% (Indicates COST's performance is at the 94.1st percentile relative to its historical divergence from VOO.)

The table below shows CAGR, Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta, and market capitalization for various periods.

Note that higher MDD in later years indicates increased risk, despite high returns.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 27.0% | 55.6% | -2.0% | 0.1 | 74.3 |
| 2016-2018  | 16.0% | 61.5% | -2.0% | 0.2 | 82.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 54.0% | 61.5% | 25.0% | 0.4 | 119.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 67.0% | 80.0% | 42.0% | 0.2 | 158.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 138.0% | 80.0% | 84.0% | 0.2 | 241.1 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $917.1
* **Last Market Price:** $917.69
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $944.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $924.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $976.67

The price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.05 from the previous close might indicate a short-term rebound, but further observation is needed.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk category)
* **RSI:** 56.08 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.36 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change:** +1.4 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 30.9% (Significant outperformance compared to S&P 500)

The high MRI suggests caution.  While the positive PPO and recent relative strength indicate short-term bullish momentum, the price is below its moving averages, implying potential further downside.  The high expected return, however, suggests long-term potential if the company continues its strong performance. The recent price increase of $1.05 is relatively small and doesn't suggest a significant rapid uptrend or downturn.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

COST has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, showing consistent growth in revenue and earnings.  However, the current price is below its moving averages, and the high MRI indicates a high-risk profile.  While the expected long-term return is attractive, investors should carefully consider the current market conditions and potential downside risk before investing. The recent earnings data requires clarification due to a duplicate entry.  Further research into the drivers of the Q3 2024 revenue and ROE spikes, as well as the reasons for the recent price decline, is crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.
