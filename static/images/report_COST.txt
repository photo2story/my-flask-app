## Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) is a multinational corporation that operates a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs.  The cumulative return for COST is 318.43%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.69%. The difference is 197.7%, placing it at the 93.4th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates a substantial outperformance.  The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting consistent outperformance relative to the market, although the beta values are significantly higher than 1 indicating higher volatility than the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $958.82
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $956.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $976.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $927.05

The price is slightly below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent minor downturn.  However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 32.79 (Suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity)
* **PPO:** -0.72 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -4.3% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 138.5% (Long-term (2+ years) expected outperformance versus the S&P 500)

The RSI and PPO indicators paint a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.  The negative relative divergence reinforces the short-term downward trend. The high expected return suggests strong long-term growth potential.  The current price of $958.82 is not exceptionally high or low relative to recent trends, and does not signal a major event.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue has generally increased over the reported quarters, though there's some fluctuation.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS has shown some fluctuation but has generally trended upwards.
* **Significant Changes:** There's no clear trend between the last two quarters. Q4 2024 (Dec 19) reported EPS is slightly higher than Q3 2024 (June 6) despite reporting higher sales in Q3 2024. This should be investigated further for a full analysis.
* **Beats/Misses:**  No expectations data is provided, therefore it is impossible to determine if any results beat or missed expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates, but profit margins remain consistently high (around 12.5% - 13%).

**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity and ROE show fluctuations which requires further investigation. A significant increase in equity is noted between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.  There is also some significant fluctuation in ROE which may indicate potential operational changes and therefore requires further investigation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information.  The provided data lacks information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions.  To complete this section, I need access to current news sources and financial analysis reports.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

COST has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly. While recent short-term trends suggest a minor downturn, the longer-term outlook remains positive. The high expected return is attractive for long-term investors. However, some caution is warranted due to the mixed signals from technical indicators and the volatility shown in recent quarterly earnings and financial information. Further investigation into the reasons behind the quarterly earnings and financial information volatility is recommended.   The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a fully comprehensive analysis.  Additional data is needed to assess the current market sentiment and potential risks.


**8. Recommendation:**

Given the historical outperformance, long-term growth potential, and currently oversold conditions (according to RSI), COST could be a strong consideration for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance. However, a comprehensive analysis of recent news, analyst sentiment, and a deeper dive into the fluctuations in quarterly earnings and financial information is crucial before making any investment decisions.
