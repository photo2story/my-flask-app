**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: 960.89
* Last Market Price: 970.38
* 5-Day Moving Average: 947.76
* 20-Day Moving Average: 916.78
* 60-Day Moving Average: 900.33

The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. The slight dip from the last market price to the closing price might indicate minor profit-taking.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 72.49 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term correction)
* PPO: 0.48 (Positive value indicates bullish momentum)
* 20-Day Relative Strength Change: +8.6 (Short-term upward momentum)

The RSI is nearing overbought levels, suggesting a potential pullback might be imminent. However, the positive PPO and strong relative strength change indicate continued bullish momentum in the short term. The last market price (970.38) being slightly higher than the closing price doesn't indicate a significant rapid upward or downward movement; rather a minor correction.  The expected return of 136.2% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a significant projection,  and needs to be viewed with caution as it is not guaranteed.
