## Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) is a multinational corporation that operates a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs.

The cumulative return of COST is 302.45%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 115.96%.  The difference is 186.5%, placing it at the 88.5th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong outperformance compared to the market benchmark. The provided Alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a modest outperformance relative to the market's beta, which has been increasing over the years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $922.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $945.36
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $972.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $930.21

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The significant gap between the current price and the 5 and 20-day moving averages might indicate a recent price drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (19.06):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound.  However, this should be interpreted cautiously as it could also signal continued downward pressure.

* **PPO (-0.88):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.

* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence (-5.6%):**  Indicates a recent weakening in relative strength.

* **Expected Return (28.9%):**  A projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance of the S&P 500.  This should be considered an estimate and is subject to significant market volatility and other unforeseen circumstances.  The current price of $922.21, considering it's below the moving averages and the negative indicators, doesn't suggest immediate 급반등 (sharp rebound). Rather, it aligns more with a potential for continued downward movement, albeit the RSI might signal a possible bounce from oversold conditions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COST has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downward trend, supported by technical indicators like the RSI and PPO, along with the price being below its moving averages. Despite this,  the company displays solid fundamental performance with generally increasing revenue and EPS, along with relatively stable profit margins. The long-term outlook remains positive, with a projected outperformance of the S&P 500, although this projection should be viewed cautiously.  The absence of recent news and analyst opinions limits a comprehensive evaluation of the current market sentiment. Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the financial statements and a review of current market news, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
