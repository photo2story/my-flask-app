Costco (COST) has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, supported by strong alpha generation and relatively low volatility. Recent price action indicates a short-term downtrend, potentially driven by company-specific news or market sentiment. However, the oversold RSI and strong buy signal suggest a potential buying opportunity. Analysts remain positive on Costco's prospects, with a "Buy" consensus and target prices significantly above the current level.  The company's financial performance is solid, with growing revenue and relatively stable profit margins.  The high Market Risk Indicator further suggests a favorable investment environment.

**Recommendation:**

Despite the recent price dip, Costco appears to be a fundamentally strong company with positive long-term prospects. The current price may represent a buying opportunity for long-term investors, considering the positive analyst ratings and the company's solid financial performance. However, caution is advised in the short term due to the downward price momentum and the need to investigate the factors driving the recent price decline. Additional research into the 2024-08-31 revenue spike and the cause for a repeat EPS entry on 2025-06-05 is warranted.
