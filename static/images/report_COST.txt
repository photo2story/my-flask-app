This report analyzes Costco Wholesale Corp (COST), a multinational corporation operating a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Costco's cumulative return of 321.86% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 76.08%.  The difference is 245.8%, placing it at the 99th percentile of its historical range (max: 248.5, min: -12.3). This indicates COST has historically outperformed the market significantly.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently positive alpha across all periods, indicating COST's outperformance even after adjusting for market risk (Beta).  The beta values are generally low to moderate, implying a level of market sensitivity but also potential for less volatility than the broader market.  However,  we must note that high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values, especially in recent years, might signal higher risk.  A deeper investigation of individual periods is needed to fully understand this risk-return trade-off.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $967.75
* **Previous Close:** $976.92
* **Change:** -$0.94 (a slight decrease)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $970.34
* **20-day Moving Average:** $942.09
* **60-day Moving Average:** $980.19

The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend, but above its 20-day moving average, indicating potential support.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.56 (Neither overbought nor oversold)

* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence:** +1.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 29.7% (S&P 500 outperformance)

The recent price drop of -$0.94 is relatively small and doesn't suggest a significant event.  The positive PPO and upward relative strength divergence signal potential continued upward momentum, but the MRI suggests caution due to the medium-risk level. The high expected return is promising, but it's crucial to remember that this is a projection and not a guarantee.

A comprehensive analysis involving factors like competitive landscape, future growth projections, and macroeconomic conditions is recommended for a more complete picture.
