## Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) is a multinational corporation operating a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs.  Its strong performance significantly outpaces the S&P 500, demonstrating high growth potential but also potentially high risk due to elevated valuation.  Recent financial performance shows consistent revenue growth and profitability, though some metrics exhibit volatility.  High RSI suggests potential overbought conditions.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Costco's cumulative return (361.69%) drastically outperforms the S&P 500's return (121.84%) over the analyzed period. The current divergence is 239.8%, placing it at the 99.1th percentile of historical divergence based on the provided min/max range. This indicates a significantly higher return than the S&P 500, but also carries the implication of higher risk due to its extreme position relative to historical trends.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 25.0% | 9.1% | -4.0% | 0.1 | 74.3 |

| 2020-2022  | 42.0% | 15.0% | 33.0% | 0.1 | 195.3 |
| 2021-2023  | 111.0% | 15.0% | 87.0% | 0.6 | 291.0 |

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant growth, while the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) suggests periods of risk.  Alpha, generally indicating outperformance relative to the benchmark, is highly volatile and shows periods of both underperformance and significant overperformance. Beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, fluctuates but tends to be relatively low.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $1071.85
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $1066.82
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $1002.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $969.30

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. However, the relatively small gap between the price and the 5-day moving average indicates the recent price action is less aggressive than previously.  The negative change from the previous close (-0.47%) signals a minor recent decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 85.88 –  This extremely high RSI indicates the stock is significantly overbought and potentially vulnerable to a correction.
* **PPO:** 0.76 –  A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.7 –  This signifies a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 22.8% – This implies a substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, but high risk should be acknowledged given the high current valuation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

COST has demonstrated exceptional growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, the high RSI and substantial divergence from the market suggest a potentially overvalued state and elevated risk. While the financial statements show strong revenue and profitability, there's some volatility in key metrics.  Long-term prospects seem positive based on the high expected return, but the risk of a near-term correction should be considered.  A more detailed analysis, including a deeper dive into the reasons behind the variability in financial metrics and a review of competitor performance, would provide a more comprehensive picture.  Investors should exercise caution due to the high valuation and potential for near-term corrections.
