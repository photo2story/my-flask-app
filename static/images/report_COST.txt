**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Costco (COST) exhibits a strong track record of outperformance relative to the S&P 500, supported by consistently high growth rates and generally positive alpha values. While recent price movement shows some consolidation, technical indicators suggest a generally positive outlook.  Financials show a stable and profitable company with consistent revenue and profit margins.  The high projected long-term return, coupled with a relatively stable valuation and financial strength, indicates COST could be a strong long-term investment. However, investors should be mindful of the relatively high maximum drawdown observed in the past few years suggesting a potentially higher risk profile than previously exhibited.  Further investigation into the duplicate data point in the earnings analysis and a more detailed examination of potential risks associated with the high maximum drawdown are recommended before making an investment decision.
