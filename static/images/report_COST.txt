## Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) Stock Analysis

**0. Overview:** Costco Wholesale Corp is a multinational corporation operating a chain of membership-only big-box retail warehouses.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Costco's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 346.1% for COST compared to 117.3% for VOO. The difference is 228.8%, placing it at the 94.9th percentile of the historical range of differences (max 242.0%, min -15.9%). This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the market benchmark.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data further supports this outperformance, showing consistently higher growth rates for COST than implied by the market (VOO). Alpha values, indicating excess return beyond what's expected given the market beta, are generally positive, but volatile, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market risk.  The Beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, is consistently high, indicating that COST is significantly more volatile than the market as a whole.  This high beta explains the large swings in alpha and the generally high MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  The market capitalization also shows significant growth during the period.

* **Closing Price:** $1035.60
* **5-day Moving Average:** $1044.81
* **20-day Moving Average:** $1028.02
* **60-day Moving Average:** $978.16

The price is currently below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bearish trend, while above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicating a longer-term bullish trend.  This shows recent slight price correction but remains overall strong in the longer term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.49 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.3663 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum, although small)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -4.2% (Indicates a recent short-term decline in relative strength)
* **Expected Return:** 25.5% (Long-term (2+ years) expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500).

The small price change in the `Last-market` data (0.055%) is not significant enough to classify as a sudden jump or drop.  The positive expected return suggests that despite recent minor bearish indicators, the long-term outlook remains positive due to historical outperformance.
