**Analysis:** The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend. However, it remains above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend.  The recent price change is minimal (approximately 0.02%), therefore no significant immediate price action (like a sudden spike or drop) is observed.

* **RSI:** 66.29 (Slightly above the neutral 50; not significantly overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.21 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)

* **Expected Return:** 25.8% (Long-term expected excess return over S&P 500)

**Analysis:**  The RSI indicates that the stock is not overbought, while the negative PPO confirms the short-term bearish momentum observed in the moving averages. The negative relative divergence further supports a short-term correction.  The high expected return suggests a potential long-term investment opportunity.
