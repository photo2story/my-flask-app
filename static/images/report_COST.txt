**7. Overall Analysis:**

COST shows a strong track record of outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with consistently high CAGR and relatively low MDD, although recent relative divergence and a high RSI suggest the stock may be overbought in the short term.  The company demonstrates healthy revenue growth and relatively stable profit margins.  However,  the high projected return should be considered cautiously and is heavily dependent on the continued outperformance against the S&P500.  Further research into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a comprehensive assessment before making any investment decisions.  The high RSI warrants close monitoring for potential short-term corrections.  Long-term investors with a high risk tolerance might find COST attractive, but thorough due diligence is paramount given the high valuation implied by the high relative divergence and potential overbought condition.
