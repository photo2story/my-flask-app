* **20-Day Moving Average:** $925.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $903.11

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 65.45 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in a relatively neutral territory.

* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** +10.0 – Shows a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 137.9% – This implies a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.

The recent price of $961.75 does not suggest a sudden spike in price to warrant mention of a 'rapid surge' or 'rapid decline'.

**4. Recent Financial Performance & Outlook:**

The recent earnings show some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue. While revenue has generally been increasing, EPS has shown some variability.  It's important to compare the most recent EPS ($3.79) and revenue ($58.52B) figures with analyst expectations to determine if the results exceeded or fell short of predictions.  Without analyst estimates, it's difficult to fully interpret the performance.  The provided data also shows a duplicate entry for 2024-06-06. This needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

The provided financial data (Revenue and Profitability, and Capital and Profitability) shows consistent profitability with healthy profit margins and ROE (Return on Equity). Revenue shows a general upward trend. However, further analysis is needed to evaluate the financial health comprehensively, including considering debt levels, cash flow, etc.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  To provide insightful analysis on recent news, including earnings reports from sources like Shacknews and market outlook from FINBOLD, please provide the relevant news articles or links.  Without this information, a comprehensive analysis cannot be completed.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

COST has historically exhibited strong performance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by high cumulative returns and a consistent alpha.  Recent price action suggests a long-term uptrend, but short-term consolidation is possible. Technical indicators show neutral-to-bullish sentiment.  Financial data reflects consistent profitability and revenue growth. However, a full evaluation necessitates a deeper dive into the latest earnings report compared to analyst estimates, comprehensive financial statements, and recent news and analyst opinions.  The expected long-term return is significant but needs to be viewed with the understanding that it is a projection.

This report analyzes Costco Wholesale Corp (COST), highlighting its significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the past period, supported by strong financial metrics and positive technical indicators.  While long-term prospects seem favorable based on historical data,  a comprehensive evaluation requires further information on recent news, earnings compared to analyst expectations, and a more detailed analysis of the financial statements. The absence of recent news and analyst opinion significantly limits the completeness of this report.  Further data is necessary for a fully informed investment decision.
