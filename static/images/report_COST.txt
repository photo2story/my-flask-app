Equity values show some volatility.  The data needs to be analyzed in conjunction with other relevant financial metrics for a holistic assessment.


| Quarter    | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| 2024-11-30 | 62.15         | 12.94%        | 24.45        | 7.35    |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COST has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the period considered.  While recent price action shows a slight pullback, the underlying fundamentals (consistent revenue growth and profitability, positive momentum indicators) remain strong.  The high long-term expected return is attractive. However, the relatively high RSI suggests the possibility of a short-term correction.  Careful consideration of risk tolerance and diversification is advisable.  Further research into the duplicated data entry in the earnings report is crucial before drawing definitive conclusions.  A thorough analysis of other key financial ratios (debt levels, cash flow) is recommended for a complete investment assessment.
