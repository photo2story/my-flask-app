In other words, it's been a strong performer even considering general market movements. Note the alpha of the past 2-3 years has decreased quite a bit.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are around 0.4, suggesting that COST is less volatile than the overall market. This can be a desirable characteristic for investors seeking relative stability.
*   **CAGR & MDD:** High CAGR combined with significant MDD shows high growth but also periods of large drawdowns. Investors should be aware of this potential volatility. High MDD of 80.9% are not sustainable or real so need to check data integrity.
