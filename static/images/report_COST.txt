**Recommendation:**

Given the strong long-term outlook (high expected return, solid financials) and historically consistent outperformance, COST remains an attractive investment for long-term investors *with a moderate risk tolerance*.

However, the recent short-term weakness and negative signals warrant caution. Investors should:

*   **Monitor the situation closely:**  Pay attention to upcoming earnings reports, news releases, and analyst commentary.
*   **Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging:** If interested in adding to or initiating a position, consider a strategy of dollar-cost averaging to mitigate the risk of short-term volatility.
*   **Heed the Hybrid Signal with caution:** The recommendation to sell a small portion of holdings suggests a defensive approach.

In short: Long-term buy-and-hold *potentially*, but proceed with caution and monitor the stock closely due to recent weakness.
