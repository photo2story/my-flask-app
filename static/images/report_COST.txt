## Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) is a multinational corporation that operates a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs.  The cumulative return of COST is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **COST Cumulative Return:** 349.45%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 127.58%
* **Difference:** 221.87%
* **Relative Divergence:** 100.0% (This indicates COST's performance is at the highest point of its historical range relative to VOO.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows consistently positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and a beta generally below 1 (lower volatility than the market), particularly from 2019-2021. This suggests COST has historically delivered strong risk-adjusted returns.  However, it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $964.01 (Last Market: $956.64)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $939.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $913.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $899.17

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price is relatively small, indicating stability in the immediate term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 74.63 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.46 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.11 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 8.08% (This represents the expected excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.)

The RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, and a correction could be imminent. However, the positive PPO and upward relative divergence indicate continued upward momentum in the short term. The high expected return is encouraging for long-term investors.  A significant price jump from $956.64 to $964.01 suggests a positive market reaction, potentially to recent news or earnings. This is not necessarily a *rapid* jump in the context of COST's history.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS and revenue data show some fluctuation.  While revenue generally increases, EPS shows some quarterly variation.  To properly assess the most recent results, we need the analyst estimates for 2024-06-06 EPS and revenue to compare to the actuals and determine if the company beat or missed expectations.  This information is not provided in the initial data.  A deeper dive into the financial statements and analyst reports is necessary for a complete picture.

**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

The revenue and profitability data show consistent revenue growth and a relatively stable profit margin around 12.5%.  The capital and profitability data show some fluctuation in equity and ROE, but generally indicate a healthy financial position. Further analysis requires examining the balance sheet and cash flow statement for more comprehensive insights.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  The prompt requests news within the last two days, but this information isn't provided.  To gain insights into recent market outlook, analyst opinions and performance highlights, relevant news sources like those from FINBOLD, Shacknews and others should be consulted.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

COST has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  While current technical indicators show some potential for short-term correction (overbought RSI), the long-term outlook appears positive based on the high expected return and consistent historical alpha.  However, a more in-depth analysis of the recent earnings report (including comparison to estimates), a thorough review of the financial statements, and an examination of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a complete and up-to-date assessment of the stock.  The lack of recent news data limits a comprehensive conclusion.
