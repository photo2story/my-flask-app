**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 70.34 - Approaching overbought territory (above 70).  This suggests potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.18 - Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +3.3% - Indicates a recent period of upward price movement.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 8.05% -  This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 with long-term (2+ years) investment.
