**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some variability in EPS and revenue over the last few quarters.  While revenue generally shows an upward trend, EPS fluctuates. Note that there is a duplicate entry for 2024-06-06, which may be an error in the data source.  Analyzing only the unique entries:


* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue growth is noticeable between Q4 2023 ($57.80B) and Q1 2024 ($58.44B) but then declined slightly in the subsequent quarter ($58.52B), before increasing substantially to $79.70B at the end of August 2024.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS shows fluctuation. While there's a slight decline from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024, it increased further in Q2 2024 and remained stable at $2.94 in Q3. Comparing this with the last reported quarterly EPS in the initial data section ($3.79), the most recent quarter shows an apparent discrepancy.  More complete data would be necessary to reliably interpret this variation.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows seasonal fluctuations, with higher revenue in the quarters ending August and lower in the quarters ending February. Profit margins remain relatively stable around 12.5%, indicating consistent profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows fluctuations with a notable drop in Q4 2023. ROE also fluctuates, likely reflecting changes in both equity and net income. A more in-depth analysis would require more context (understanding the drivers of equity changes).

This section requires information about recent news articles, market outlook reports, and analyst opinions to provide a complete analysis.  The provided data doesn't contain this information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COST has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the provided historical period. While the recent RSI suggests potential short-term correction, the long-term outlook appears bullish, supported by a strong expected return and consistently positive alpha.  However, some inconsistencies in the provided earnings data need clarification.  Revenue shows a seasonal pattern, and profit margins remain stable. A thorough analysis requires a more complete and consistent data set, along with current news and market outlook information.  Analyzing the most recent EPS value shows a disparity with the prior provided data, so additional information is needed for a definitive interpretation.
