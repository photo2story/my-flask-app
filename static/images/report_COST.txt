**6. Overall Conclusion:**

COST shows a strong track record of outperformance relative to the S&P 500, supported by consistent positive alpha and generally low beta. Recent price movements suggest a potential short-term correction, but the long-term outlook remains positive, especially considering the strong earnings and financial health.  However, the significant drop in price and the high MRI indicate caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and the outlier in Q2 2024 revenue is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high expected return, coupled with the high risk indicator, suggests that potential investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing.
