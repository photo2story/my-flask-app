**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $957.77
* **5-day Moving Average:** $975.25
* **20-day Moving Average:** $949.47
* **60-day Moving Average:** $981.31

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  The significant drop from the previous close ($994.50 to $957.77, a -3.69 change) indicates a recent price decline.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 52.61 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.62 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 32.5% (Long-term, exceeding S&P 500)

The relatively low MRI suggests moderate risk.  The recent price drop (-3.69) is notable but doesn't necessarily signal a major downward trend, given the positive PPO and slightly above-neutral RSI. The high expected return reflects the historical outperformance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|----------------|

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Costco (COST) demonstrates strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.

The high expected return, coupled with a moderate risk profile, makes COST an attractive investment for long-term investors.  However, further investigation is warranted to clarify the duplicated earnings data.  Considering the relatively low Beta, the investment may be more suitable for investors with moderate risk tolerance who aren't seeking aggressive market-correlated gains.
