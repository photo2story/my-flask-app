## Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) Stock Report

This report analyzes Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) based on the provided data.  Costco Wholesale Corp is a multinational corporation operating a chain of large-format membership-only warehouse clubs.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Costco's cumulative return (302.22%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (115.41%) over the measured period. The difference is 186.8%, placing it at the 88.6th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong historical outperformance. The provided alpha consistently shows a positive value, further supporting this conclusion.  The high beta values indicate significant market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $927.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $919.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $952.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $933.25

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The price is only slightly below the 60-day average. This is important.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (25.21):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.54):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.9, suggesting short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 29% above the S&P 500. This suggests a significantly higher long-term return compared to the market.  This is conditional on the conditions remaining constant.
* **Price Level:** The price of $927.37 does not immediately signal a major event (sharp increase or decrease).  More context would be needed to make any such conclusion.  However, the combination of a negative PPO and an oversold RSI presents conflicting signals, requiring further investigation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a generally upward trend in both revenue and EPS, although there are some minor fluctuations:

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue generally increased quarter-over-quarter, except for a slight dip in Q4 2024.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS demonstrates a trend of growth, though there is quarter-to-quarter variability.
* **Significant Changes:** No significant unexpected jumps or drops were observed.
* **Beats/Misses:** No expectations data was given to assess beats or misses.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some volatility, while profit margins remain relatively stable around 12.5%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity and ROE fluctuate. The ROE experienced considerable improvement in Q2 and Q1 2024.  This is likely linked to changes in market conditions and other factors that need further context to understand completely.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions were provided.  Additional information is needed to complete this section.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Costco (COST) demonstrates a history of strong outperformance against the S&P 500, as indicated by its significantly higher cumulative returns and consistently positive alpha. While recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, technical indicators (oversold RSI) hint at potential upward movement. The company's financial health seems sound, with consistent revenue and fairly stable profit margins.  However, the recent negative PPO and conflicting technical signals require more data to be confidently interpreted. The outlook is encouraging but requires more detailed current information regarding market expectations, news, and analyst sentiment to paint a complete picture.  The projected long-term outperformance suggests COST as a good candidate for long-term, buy-and-hold investment.

**8.  Caveats:**

This analysis is based solely on the limited data provided.  A more comprehensive analysis would require access to additional information, including:

* Full financial statements (including balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements).
* Detailed analyst reports and price forecasts.
* Current market news and economic forecasts.
