**1. Performance Comparison & Relative Strength:**

Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) is a multinational corporation operating a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs.  The cumulative return of COST is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  At the last data point, COST shows a cumulative return of 333.17%, while VOO shows 122.19%. This results in a difference of 211.0 percentage points.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently positive alpha values (0.1) across all periods, indicating COST has outperformed the market (presumably a market index proxied by the beta values). Beta values fluctuate between 74 and 440 but consistently show high sensitivity to market movements.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) demonstrates strong consistent growth.  However, the increasing Maximum Drawdown (MDD) suggests higher risk in recent years, despite continued strong returns.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally increased over time, with some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.  The most recent quarter shows a significant increase compared to the preceding quarter (Q2 2024).
* **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** EPS has also fluctuated, showing a dip in Q4 2023 followed by an increase in Q1 2024 and slight decrease again in Q2 2024.  There's a discrepancy in the data; 2024-06-06 shows two different EPS values, and this needs clarification.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COST has demonstrated exceptionally strong long-term performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially overbought market, but the long-term outlook remains positive.  The company demonstrates consistent revenue growth and profitability, although there is some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation. However, additional information is needed on recent news, market outlook, and analyst expectations to provide a complete picture. The inconsistencies in the earnings data require clarification. The high MDD suggests increased risk, although the company still delivers high returns.  The long-term expected return is compelling, making it attractive for a long-term investment strategy.  Investors should, however, be aware of the potential for short-term volatility and overbought conditions.
