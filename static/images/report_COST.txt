The cumulative return for COST is 300.19%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 117.62%. The difference is 182.6%, placing it at the 86.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong outperformance.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $959.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $932.11

The price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.  This aligns with the negative recent relative divergence.

The low RSI value suggests the stock may be oversold, potentially presenting a buying opportunity for long-term investors.
