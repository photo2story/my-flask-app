**6. Overall Analysis:**

Costco (COST) shows strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, evidenced by a high cumulative return and consistently positive alpha. While recent earnings show positive revenue growth, the extremely high RSI suggests potential short-term overvaluation and a possible pullback.  The positive PPO and above-average moving averages hint at continued upward momentum in the long term. However, the lack of detailed financial information limits a thorough assessment.  The expected long-term return is positive, but  investors should monitor the RSI closely and consider the possibility of a near-term correction before making investment decisions.  A deeper dive into the financials is necessary for a more conclusive analysis.
