COST has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent price movements suggest a bullish trend, supported by positive PPO and a recent increase in relative divergence.

Financial information indicates stable profitability, but equity and ROE require further analysis to understand fluctuations.  The high expected return, combined with the historical outperformance, suggests a potentially attractive long-term investment opportunity, but investors should monitor the RSI and potential short-term corrections.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in the data is needed to solidify the analysis.
