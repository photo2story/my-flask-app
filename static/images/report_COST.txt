**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Assessment):**

Costco exhibits strong fundamentals, significant historical outperformance versus the S&P 500, positive analyst sentiment, and solid revenue and profitability. However, recent technical indicators suggest a potential short-term pullback, indicated by the decreasing 20-day relative spread change, the negative PPO, and the hybrid signal suggesting some cash allocation. The recent increase in price is a positive sign, but the moving average analysis suggests potential resistance. Long-term, Costco appears well-positioned for continued growth, supported by a low-risk MRI and high expected return.
