## Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) is a multinational corporation operating a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **COST Cumulative Return:** 309.08%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 118.37%
* **Return Difference:** 190.7%
* **Relative Divergence:** 90.3% (indicating COST's performance is in the top 90% percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO).

The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a small degree of outperformance compared to the market benchmark.  The beta is consistently low, suggesting low market volatility.  However, the significantly higher CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values over the different periods showcase COST's superior growth potential. The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values remain relatively low, indicating good resilience during market downturns.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $943.19
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $925.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $933.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $937.24

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The recent price change of $2.55 (from previous close) indicates a relatively small positive movement, not indicating a significant surge.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.99 (slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.03 (positive, indicating a bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -1.5% (mildly bearish short-term trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 28% (significantly higher than the implied return from the S&P 500, reflecting COST's expected outperformance over the long term).

The recent small price increase coupled with the negative 20-day relative strength change suggests caution; the overall picture is positive, but near-term movement might be slightly volatile.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent revenue growth and relatively stable EPS (Earnings Per Share) figures.  While there's a minor dip in EPS in the December 2023 quarter, overall, the company demonstrates strong financial performance.  However, note that there's a duplicate entry for 2024-12-19.  Clarification on the data accuracy is needed.


| Date       | EPS   | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-12-19 | 4.05  | 62.15         |
| 2024-06-06 | 3.79  | 58.52         |
| 2024-03-13 | 3.93  | 58.44         |
| 2023-12-20 | 3.58  | 57.80         |
| **2024-12-19** | 3.58  | 57.80         | *(Duplicate entry?)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability show mostly stable growth, with slight fluctuations quarter-to-quarter.  There's a noticeable increase in revenue from Q2 2024, which is positive. Equity and ROE (Return on Equity) show some variance but tend towards a positive trend.  The significant jump in equity from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 should be investigated further.

| Quarter     | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin (%) | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|---------|
| 2024-11-30  | 62.15         | 12.94            | 24.45        | 7.35    |
| 2024-08-31  | 79.70         | 12.68            | 23.62        | 9.97    |
| 2024-05-31  | 58.52         | 12.55            | 21.77        | 7.72    |
| 2024-02-29  | 58.44         | 12.49            | 20.76        | 8.40    |
| 2023-11-30  | 57.80         | 12.70            | 26.15        | 6.08    |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

COST shows strong long-term growth potential, consistently outperforming the S&P 500.  While short-term indicators suggest some minor caution, the overall financial health and historical performance paint a positive picture.  The high expected return, coupled with relatively low risk (as indicated by low beta and MDD), makes COST an attractive investment for long-term investors. However, further investigation is needed to clarify the duplicate entry in the earnings data and the significant equity change between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.  Consider adding other relevant financial metrics for a more comprehensive assessment (e.g., debt levels, cash flow).
