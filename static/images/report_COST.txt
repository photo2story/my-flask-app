**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data severely limits a complete financial analysis.  This missing information prevents a comprehensive assessment of profitability and financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Costco (COST) demonstrates a strong historical performance significantly exceeding the S&P 500.  Positive alpha and growth in market capitalization support this.  However, the extremely high RSI and moderately high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values suggest a potential for a price correction.  While the recent price action shows an upward trend, the overbought condition warrants caution. The lack of key financial data prevents a full assessment of the company's financial health.  Long-term investors should consider the potential for both significant returns and periods of substantial drawdown.  Further investigation into the missing financial data and confirmation of the earnings data are crucial before making any investment decisions.
