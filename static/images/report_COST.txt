* **Closing Price:** $939.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $951.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $975.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $929.42

The stock is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend. The current price is relatively close to the 60-day MA, suggesting the price might be consolidating.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 21.66 - This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO:** -0.75 - Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -4.6% - Indicates a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return:** 27.3% - This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming continued historical trends.  Given the current price being below its recent moving averages and the low RSI, this projection may need careful consideration as it could represent a situation where the market has already priced in some of the future growth.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a generally increasing trend in both revenue and EPS, with some minor fluctuations.  There's no information on whether these numbers beat or missed expectations, as those figures are not included.

* **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue has generally been increasing quarter-over-quarter, although there is a slight decline between Q2 2024 and Q3 2024.
* **EPS Trend:** EPS has also shown an overall upward trend, although it dipped slightly in Q4 2023.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates but generally shows growth, and profit margins are consistently high and stable, ranging from 12.49% to 12.94% over the reported period.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity and ROE show some volatility. ROE is generally strong, indicating good returns on investment. However, there was a significant drop in equity from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024 and a corresponding decrease in ROE, before another increase in Q2 2024. This warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last 2 days) earnings news or specific market outlook or analyst opinions are provided.  Further research is needed to gather this information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COST has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong growth in revenue and EPS.  However, recent price action suggests a short-term downward trend, although the long-term outlook, as suggested by the 60-day moving average and the high projected return, remains positive, although the risk needs to be assessed due to recent price decreases. The current low RSI suggests the stock may be oversold, but the negative PPO suggests bearish momentum. The significant drop in equity between Q1 and Q4 2024, combined with the recent price movement, needs further investigation and analysis before making investment decisions. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits the full assessment of the current market sentiment.  The information provided suggests a potentially attractive long-term investment, but a deeper dive into recent news, financial reports (beyond the limited data provided), and analyst expectations is critical before any conclusion.
