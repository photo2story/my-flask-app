The provided relative divergence metric of 100.0 indicates COST's performance is at the highest point compared to VOO within the historical data range.  The alpha consistently shows near zero, suggesting the outperformance isn't due to factors unrelated to market movements (this needs more data to confirm). The beta is not provided directly but implied to be near 0.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $982.15 (Last market: $987.49)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $972.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $939.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $907.66

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The small difference between the closing price and the last market price implies minimal change since the last market close.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.66 (Above 70 would generally suggest overbought conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.39 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:**  `nan` (Insufficient data provided to interpret).  A negative value would indicate a recent divergence between price and momentum, possibly foreshadowing a price correction.
* **Expected Return:** 136.5% (This represents a significant outperformance relative to S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) assuming the current trend continues).  However, this should be viewed with caution; such high expected returns are rarely sustainable. The last market price of 987.49 is close enough to the reported close price (982.15) that no significant sudden movements needs to be flagged.
