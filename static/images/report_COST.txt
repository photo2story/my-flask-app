## Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:**

Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) is a multinational corporation operating a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs.  Its stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, showing high growth potential but also increased volatility.  While recent performance indicators are strong, investors should consider the elevated valuation and associated risks.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Costco's cumulative return (333.51%) vastly exceeds the S&P 500's (76.18%). The relative divergence currently sits at 100% of its historical range (max 257.3%, min -12.3%), indicating a historically high level of outperformance.

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across multiple years, despite substantial maximum drawdown (MDD).  Alphas generally indicate outperformance relative to the market (positive values), and betas represent volatility relative to the market (higher values indicate greater volatility).  COST's consistently positive alphas and varying betas across the periods suggest significant outperformance,  but with increased risk in recent years. The rising market capitalization (Cap(B)) demonstrates sustained growth.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Costco exhibits strong historical and recent performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However,  the high relative divergence, approaching overbought RSI, and moderate market risk suggest that the stock might be overvalued or at least highly priced. The substantial and consistent growth demonstrated in both revenue, profit margins and ROE indicates a financially healthy company.  Despite the current high valuation, long-term investors (2+ years) might still find the projected 29% S&P 500-relative return attractive, but should be mindful of the risk associated with the high valuation and potential volatility.  Further investigation into the duplicate entry in the earnings data is recommended.  Regular monitoring of key indicators and market conditions is crucial for managing the inherent risks.
