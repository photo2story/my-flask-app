**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $964.31
* **Previous Close:** $965.19
* **Change:** -$0.09 (Slight decrease)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $932.57
* **20-day Moving Average:** $928.85
* **60-day Moving Average:** $977.56

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, the difference is not significant.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 64.19 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.58 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** -0.4 (Short-term weakening in relative strength)
* **Expected Return:** 28.1% (Significant long-term outperformance of the S&P 500 is expected)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO is positive and RSI is not in overbought territory, the negative change in relative strength and the recent price decline suggest caution. However, the high expected return remains encouraging for long-term investors. The small price drop is not significant enough to suggest a sharp reversal.
