## Costco Wholesale Corp (COST) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures:**

* **Cumulative Return (COST):** 343.83%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 108.99%
* **Return Difference (COST vs VOO):** 234.8%
* **Relative Divergence:** 97.2% (Indicates COST significantly outperformed VOO historically, within the context of its historical range of outperformance).


**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Costco Wholesale Corp is a multinational corporation operating a chain of membership-only warehouse clubs.  Over the observed period, COST significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return dramatically higher than the benchmark.  The high relative divergence suggests this outperformance is substantial compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha and Beta data shows considerable variation year-to-year. While Beta generally indicates a high correlation with the market (above 0.6 often), Alpha (positive values) demonstrates periods of outperformance beyond market returns.  The significant increase in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and a rising market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the years is noteworthy.  However, Maximum Drawdown (MDD) also increased significantly, highlighting periods of substantial risk.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $1036.87
* **5-day Moving Average:** $1037.20
* **20-day Moving Average:** $1047.79
* **60-day Moving Average:** $985.25

The price is currently below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.  The recent price drop of -$0.95 from the previous close (-0.09%) is not a significant, sudden movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.57 (Slightly below neutral; suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.51 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.4 (Indicates short-term bearish divergence.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 24.2% (This represents a significant outperformance expectation relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, but requires further justification on the model used for this estimation)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO, combined with the negative divergence, point towards bearish momentum in the short term.  The -1.4 change in relative divergence (assuming 20-day period) suggests a recent weakening in relative strength against a benchmark. The significant positive expected return, however, is a key long-term positive.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Costco (COST) demonstrates a strong historical performance significantly exceeding the S&P 500.  While recent price action suggests short-term bearishness, the long-term outlook, supported by strong earnings, high profit margins, and a projected significant outperformance over the S&P 500 (24.2% expected return), remains positive.  However,  the high MDD values shown in the Alpha/Beta analysis warrant caution. Investors should consider risk tolerance and diversify their portfolio accordingly.  Further investigation is needed into the methodology used for the 24.2% expected return projection.  Data cleaning and validation (duplicate entry in Earnings data) are crucial for accurate analysis.
