However, data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) need to be addressed for a more accurate and comprehensive analysis.  The high Beta indicates higher volatility, which should be considered in the investment strategy.  Overall,  COST appears to be a strong performer but investors should be aware of the inherent risk associated with its higher volatility.
