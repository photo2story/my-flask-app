However, it's crucial to note that past performance doesn't guarantee future results, and the high relative divergence warrants caution.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and potential market risks is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The consistently high valuations warrant further due diligence, especially in light of current macroeconomic conditions.
