Costco (COST) demonstrates a strong track record of outperformance against the S&P 500, with consistently positive alpha and robust financial performance.  Recent price action suggests a minor correction, but the underlying fundamentals remain strong.  The medium-risk assessment, combined with positive momentum indicators (PPO) and a slightly above-neutral RSI, suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook. The high expected return (33.4%) over the long term further strengthens this positive outlook, provided the underlying trends continue.  However, close monitoring of earnings and market conditions is recommended due to recent minor price drops and seasonal revenue fluctuations.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings data) need to be resolved for a more comprehensive analysis.
