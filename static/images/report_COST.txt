**7. Overall Analysis:**

COST has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the provided period.  While recent price action suggests a healthy upward trend, the RSI is approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term volatility. The company's financial statements show consistent revenue and relatively stable profit margins, although ROE and equity show some variability.  The high projected long-term return makes it an attractive investment for those with a long-term horizon.  However, investors should monitor the RSI closely and consider the potential for short-term corrections.  Further analysis is needed to fully understand the drivers behind the observed fluctuations in ROE and equity, as well as the duplicate entry in the earnings data.  Addressing data inaccuracies would provide a much more robust analysis.
