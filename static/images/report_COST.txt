COST has demonstrated exceptional performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent indicators suggest a high-risk environment (MRI), the strong historical performance, positive momentum (PPO), and high expected returns suggest a compelling long-term investment opportunity. However,  investors should be aware of the potential volatility implied by the high Beta and MDD figures.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data point is needed, and the high risk suggested by the MRI warrants caution.  The consistently strong revenue and profitability figures support the long-term growth potential.  A thorough risk assessment considering the high market risk indicator is crucial before making any investment decisions.
