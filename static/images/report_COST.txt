COST has historically demonstrated strong performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.

However, the current high market risk indicator and recent price drop warrant caution. The duplicated data point in the earnings section needs clarification. Further investigation into the reason for the recent price drop is necessary before making investment decisions. The high expected return should be viewed with skepticism given the current market conditions and the need for further investigation into the recent price decline.
