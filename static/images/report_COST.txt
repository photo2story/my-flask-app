* **Closing Price:** $949.91
* **Last Market Price:** $958.82
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $961.12
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $977.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $925.82

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 32.69 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.76 (Indicates a bearish trend)

* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 139.0% (This represents a significant outperformance over the S&P 500 over a 2+ year period. This should be viewed with caution, as it is a projection and not a guaranteed return)
