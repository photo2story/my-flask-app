**7. Overall Analysis:**

COST shows strong historical performance significantly outpacing the S&P 500.  Recent price action suggests a short-term uptrend, supported by positive technical indicators.

Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data point is recommended.  The consistently low beta should be further analyzed to understand the high alpha, and if the low beta will persist in the future.
