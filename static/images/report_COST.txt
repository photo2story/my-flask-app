**6) Overall Analysis:**

COST has demonstrated exceptional long-term performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Financial statements show consistent profitability and revenue growth.

Despite this, the long-term outlook, supported by strong earnings, high expected return, and positive alpha, remains bullish, especially for long-term investors.  Careful monitoring of the RSI and price action is recommended to manage risk.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings) should be clarified for a more accurate analysis.
