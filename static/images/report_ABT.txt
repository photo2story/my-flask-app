The cumulative return of ABT (93.93%) lags behind the S&P 500's cumulative return (123.86%) by 29.93 percentage points. This places its current relative strength at the 12.29 percentile based on historical data, indicating underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The closing price is $115.9.  The stock price is trading slightly below its 5-day ($115.98) and 20-day ($115.94) moving averages, and significantly above its 60-day moving average ($114.85). This suggests a relatively stable, albeit slightly bearish, short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (55.85):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (-0.15):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum, aligning with the slightly bearish short-term trend observed in the moving averages.

* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The projected long-term (2+ years) excess return relative to the S&P 500 is currently zero. This implies that, based on current projections, ABT is not expected to outperform the market significantly over this timeframe.  This should be viewed cautiously given market uncertainties.  The slight discrepancy between the last-market price (115.89) and the closing price does not suggest any significant sudden price movements (e.g. rapid surge or plummet).
