This results in a significant negative divergence of -83.71, indicating a much lower return than the benchmark.

    * **PPO:** The negative PPO value of -0.47 indicates a bearish trend, aligning with the recent price movements. 
    * **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** The negative value of -8.86 indicates a recent decrease in the relative divergence, meaning the stock's performance has been weakening compared to the benchmark.
    * **Expected_Return:** The expected return of 9.87% is a positive indication, but it represents a maximum potential return over 5 years, not a guaranteed outcome.

    * PSX's most recent earnings report (2024-07-31) shows an EPS of 2.39 and revenue of $38.13 billion.
