* **Closing Price:** $204.60
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $197.75
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $202.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $222.18

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, the recent price increase ($2.43) indicates a possible short-term reversal.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.26 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** 0.66 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)

* **Expected Return:** 103.8% (over 2 years vs. S&P 500) -  This indicates significantly higher potential returns compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.  The recent price increase of $2.43, while positive, does not necessarily indicate a sharp rebound; further observation is needed to determine if this is the start of a significant upward trend.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|

Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains high.  EPS also varies, indicating potential seasonality or other factors influencing profitability.  A closer analysis of the duplicated data point (2025-01-31 and 2023-12-31 with identical values) is needed to correct the data set.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Apple (AAPL) has demonstrated exceptional performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action suggests potential short-term bearishness, the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by high growth rates, strong profitability, and a favorable expected return.  However, the data contains inconsistencies (duplicated entries) that require clarification.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the fluctuations in revenue, EPS, and ROE is necessary for a more comprehensive analysis.  Despite short-term price fluctuations,  the long-term outlook for AAPL remains strong, with a high probability of exceeding market returns.
