## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return for AAPL is 321.56%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.83%.  The difference is 198.7%, placing it at the 75.3rd percentile of historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates a strong relative performance.  The provided Alpha values of 0.0 suggest that the outperformance might be primarily due to market factors rather than manager skill.  However, the Beta is not provided making it difficult to say for sure.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $223.66
* **Last Market Price:** $222.37 (a decrease of $0.57677)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $225.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $240.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $237.20

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend in the short term.  The recent price drop of approximately $0.58 is not significant enough to be considered a sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 20.93 (This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce but not confirming it.)
* **PPO:** -1.11 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -11.3% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 82.8% (This represents an expected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if a long-term buy-and-hold strategy is employed.  This high value warrants careful consideration given the high uncertainty associated with long-term predictions.)

The low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the negative relative divergence, paint a bearish short-term picture. However, the high expected return suggests potential long-term growth.  The relatively small recent price drop doesn't warrant consideration of a significant price shift.
