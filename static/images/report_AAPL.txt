    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth over different periods. Volatility is observed across the periods.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values indicate significant potential losses during downturns, but Apple has still generated profits.
    *   **Alpha:** Positive alpha indicates outperformance relative to the market (S&P 500).  The Alpha has fluctuated significantly.
    *   **Beta:** Beta near 0 or slightly positive suggests AAPL's price movement is not strongly correlated with the overall market.
    *   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization):** Illustrates Apple's massive and growing market capitalization.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Key Numbers:**
    *   Current Price: 268.505
    *   Last-market: {'price': 268.55, 'previousClose': 269.0, 'change': -0.17}
    *   5-day Moving Average: 263.633
    *   20-day Moving Average: 256.1365
    *   60-day Moving Average: 242.1945

*   **Analysis:** The price is above all three moving averages, indicating an upward trend. The fact that the 5-day MA is above the 20-day MA, which is above the 60-day MA, further strengthens this bullish signal.  The very small change in the Last-market data suggests minimal immediate volatility despite broader market news.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Key Numbers:**
    *   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
    *   RSI: 60.65
    *   PPO: 0.37
    *   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
    *   Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change: 6.5 (+, Short-term Increase)
    *   Expected Return: 111.5% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A high MRI (0.9) suggests a favorable market environment for investment, indicating low perceived risk.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 60.65 is nearing overbought conditions (typically above 70) but not there yet, suggesting continued upward momentum.
    *   **PPO:** A positive PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which usually confirms a bullish trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** A Hybrid signal 'Buy 100% of cash' with 'Very Safe' recommendation reinforce the MRI conclusion.
    *   **Relative Spread Change:** The increase in the relative spread confirms recent outperformance.
    *   **Expected Return:**  The projected 111.5% outperformance over the S&P 500 (over 2+ years) is very optimistic, implying strong confidence in Apple's future growth.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

    *   BofA Securities Adjusts Price Target on Apple to $320 From $270, Maintains Buy Rating
    *   Nvidia's Market Cap Tops $5 Trillion

*   **Analysis:**  The news is mixed.  While there's a positive price target adjustment from BofA, the headline "Apple Crushed by Other Tech Stocks" is concerning.

*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is a "Buy" with a mean target price of $256.01. The high target of $320 suggests some analysts are very bullish, while the low of $180 indicates significant disagreement on the stock's potential. The current price is above the average target, suggesting the stock may be overvalued based on average estimates.

*   **Strengths:** Strong historical performance, bullish technical indicators, positive analyst sentiment, and robust financials.
*   **Weaknesses:**  High valuation relative to average analyst targets, mixed recent news, and declining ROE.
*   **Recommendation:** Consider a "Hold" or "Moderate Buy" strategy.  Monitor future earnings reports and market trends closely, especially regarding competition from other tech companies. Be aware that while the expected return is high, it is long term, and external factors can change.
