## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 321.56%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 122.83%.  The difference is 198.7%, placing it at the 75.3rd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a range of 270.7% to -21.2%).  The Alpha consistently shows near zero indicating a high correlation with the market, and the Beta is consistently around zero, making this a market-neutral stock.  The consistently high CAGR across all periods shows strong growth with relatively low MDD.  


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $223.66
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $225.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $240.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $237.20

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price change of -$0.0759 (approximately 0.034% change) is negligible and doesn't significantly alter the bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 20.93  (Significantly below 30, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -1.11 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -11.3% (Indicates a recent weakening of relative strength compared to the S&P 500)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 82.8%  (Significantly higher than the S&P 500's expected return, implying substantial potential outperformance over the long term. However, it is crucial to note this projection's inherent uncertainty)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally increased quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) with some minor fluctuations and the second quarter being a dip, EPS shows significant fluctuation between quarters.  The data is not presented in a straightforward way, with a duplicate entry for 2024-08-02, making a definitive trend difficult to establish without further clarification on the dataset quality.  A deeper analysis would require a more consistent and complete dataset.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-08-02 | 1.4  | 85.78        |
| 2024-05-03 | 1.53 | 90.75        |
| 2024-02-02 | 2.19 | 119.58       |
| 2023-08-04 | 1.27 | 81.80        |
| 2024-08-02 | 1.27 | 81.80        |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows generally strong profitability and return on equity (ROE). Revenue has some fluctuations but maintains a consistent high level. Profit margins are consistently high, hovering around 46%.  ROE is quite variable, indicating potential shifts in the company's capital structure and profitability drivers. Further analysis, including a comparison to previous years and industry benchmarks, is necessary to gain deeper insights.


| Quarter     | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | 94.93          | 46.22%        | 56.95        | 25.88   |
| 2024-06-30  | 85.78          | 46.26%        | 66.71        | 32.15   |
| 2024-03-31  | 90.75          | 46.58%        | 74.19        | 31.86   |
| 2023-12-31  | 119.58         | 45.87%        | 74.10        | 45.77   |
| 2023-09-30  | 89.50          | 45.17%        | 62.15        | 36.94   |



**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL's strong historical performance significantly outpaces the S&P 500.  While recent price action and technical indicators suggest short-term bearishness (oversold conditions notwithstanding), the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by the high expected return and generally strong financial performance. However, the volatility in earnings and the fluctuation in ROE warrant closer examination.  A complete picture requires a more in-depth fundamental analysis, considering macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape. The potential for significant outperformance exists, but careful consideration of risk is crucial, especially given the current market conditions.  Further investigation into the duplicate data points in earnings is necessary for a more accurate conclusion.
