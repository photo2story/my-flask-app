## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL (341.04%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (116.43%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 224.6%, placing it at the 84.2nd percentile of the historical range (max: 270.7%, min: -21.2%).  This indicates a substantially higher return compared to the benchmark.  The Alpha of 225% further confirms this significant outperformance.  The Beta of 0 suggests very little correlation with the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $234.0
* **Last Market Price:** $230.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $235.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $246.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $237.84

The price is currently below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support. The difference between the Last Market Price and Closing Price suggests a minor daily price drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 19.2  (Suggests the stock is oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.95 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.0% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 64.7% (Long-term expected excess return over the S&P 500)

The low RSI and negative PPO indicate bearish sentiment.  The negative relative divergence change reinforces the short-term bearish trend. However, the high expected return suggests a potentially positive long-term outlook if the current downturn proves temporary.  The significant difference between the closing price ($234) and last market price ($230.91) is not substantial enough to indicate a dramatic price shift (rapid upswing or downswing).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's a significant drop in revenue and EPS in the quarter ending August 2024, following a peak in February 2024. Further analysis is required to understand the underlying reasons for this fluctuation.  The duplicated data point for August 2024 needs clarification.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a very high cumulative return and a remarkably high alpha. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend.  The company's financials show some volatility in revenue and ROE, requiring further investigation. The high expected long-term return, despite the short-term bearish signals, makes it a potentially attractive investment for long-term, disciplined investors.  Further analysis is recommended to understand the reasons for the recent earnings decline and the potential for future growth. The duplicated data point in the earnings report needs to be addressed and clarified.
