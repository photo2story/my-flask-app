* **5-Day Moving Average:** $235.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $246.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $237.84

The stock is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. The price is slightly above the 60-day moving average.

* **RSI:** 19.19  (Suggests oversold conditions)

The low RSI and negative PPO indicate bearish sentiment. The negative relative divergence change confirms the short-term bearish trend. However, the high expected return suggests significant long-term potential. The relatively low last market price compared to the closing price doesn't indicate a sharp downturn or upturn.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the given period, exhibiting a strong long-term growth trajectory.  However, short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The high expected return suggests continued outperformance in the long term, despite the current short-term bearish sentiment.  Data inconsistencies in the earnings report require further verification.  A thorough review of the company's financials and future outlook is recommended before making investment decisions.  The current oversold condition (RSI) might present a buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance.
