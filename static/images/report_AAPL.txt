## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between AAPL and VOO is 199.3%, placing it at the 75.5th percentile of its historical range of divergence (max: 270.7%, min: -21.2%). This indicates AAPL has substantially outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  The alpha consistently shows as 0.0 in the provided data, indicating the model used may not fully capture the outperformance relative to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $222.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $230.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $243.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $237.42

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short-to-medium term.  The recent price change of -$3.19 indicates a short-term decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (16.94):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible.
* **PPO (-1.19):**  Shows negative momentum, aligning with the downward price trend.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-10.3%):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (82.3%):** This high expected return, relative to the S&P 500, over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon suggests significant potential for outperformance.  However, this should be interpreted cautiously and depends heavily on the model used to generate this figure.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      | Notes                                      |
|------------|--------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| 2024-08-02 | $1.40  | $85.78B      | Duplicate entry. Using the second one.     |
| 2024-05-03 | $1.53  | $90.75B      |                                          |
| 2024-02-02 | $2.19  | $119.58B     |                                          |
| 2023-08-04 | $1.27  | $81.80B      |                                          |


Revenue has fluctuated, with a significant peak in Q1 2024. EPS also shows variability, indicating potential market sensitivity and perhaps seasonality in the business.  The duplicate entry for August 2024 needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Profit margins are consistently high (45-46%), indicating strong profitability. Revenue shows some fluctuation but remains generally strong.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity and ROE show some quarter-to-quarter variation.  The high ROE values generally point to efficient capital utilization, although there is notable decline from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. Further investigation into the reasons for these fluctuations would be beneficial.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term. However, recent price action shows a short-term decline, with indicators suggesting oversold conditions. While the expected return is high, the high volatility in earnings and some financial metrics warrants caution.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the fluctuations in revenue, EPS, equity, and ROE would be necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.  The alpha of consistently 0.0 in the provided data also suggests possible limitations in the model used for the analysis.  Further analysis should include assessing the impact of macroeconomic factors and industry trends.  The discrepancy in data regarding the August 2nd earnings report needs clarification.
