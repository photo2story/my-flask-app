## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.  As of the last data point, AAPL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for AAPL is 341.04%, while the VOO's cumulative return is 116.43%.  This results in a difference of 224.6 percentage points.  The relative divergence (84.2%) indicates AAPL's performance lies in the upper percentiles of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2025  | 341.0% | 35.9% | 225.0% | 0.0 | 3457.0 |

The high alpha (225.0%) suggests significant outperformance compared to the benchmark, while a beta of 0.0 indicates little correlation with overall market movements.  This is likely an anomaly in the data provided, however.  Market cap is substantial at $3457 Billion.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $234.0
* **Last Market Price:** $230.23
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $235.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $246.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $237.84

The stock is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend.  The discrepancy between the closing and last market price requires further investigation to determine the cause.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 19.19 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO:** -0.947 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.0% – This confirms a recent short-term decline.

The significant difference between the last market price ($230.23) and the closing price ($234) needs clarification.  A sudden price jump would indicate a rapid rebound (likely due to news events).  The expected return of 64.7% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is very high and should be viewed with caution.  It's crucial to consider the volatility and inherent risk associated with such a high projected return.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|

| 2024-08-02 | $1.27 | $81.80 B      | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*

Earnings show some volatility.  Revenue is generally high but has shown a recent decline.  The duplicate entry for August 2024 needs correction. A more detailed analysis would require examination of the full data set and context for fluctuations.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Apple shows strong long-term performance significantly outpacing the S&P 500. However, recent short-term indicators suggest a potential downward trend.  The high projected long-term return should be treated with caution due to inherent market volatility.  Inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate earnings entry, price discrepancies) require further investigation before drawing definitive conclusions.  A deeper dive into the fundamental drivers of the financial data is necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.  The provided data suggest a potentially undervalued stock in the short-term based on oversold RSI but needs further investigation to confirm this.
