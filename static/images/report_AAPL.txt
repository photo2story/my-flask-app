## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 376.22%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.78%. The difference is 254.4%, placing it at the 100th percentile of the historical relative outperformance range (max: 254.4, min: -21.2).  This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the market benchmark over the observed period. The Alpha consistently shows positive values, highlighting consistent outperformance relative to the market, while Beta values are all 0.0, this is unlikely to be true and may reflect an error in the data provided.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $251.04
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $248.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $239.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $231.78

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 92.47 – Extremely overbought, indicating potential for a near-term correction.
* **PPO:** 0.396 – Positive, suggesting bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +0.8 –  Confirms short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 202.1% –  This projects significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 over the long term, but this prediction needs caution and should be considered alongside the high RSI. A 202.1% return is exceptionally high and might not be realistic. The high RSI suggests a potential near-term pullback is likely before such a return can be achieved.

The current price of $251.04, being significantly above the moving averages and with a very high RSI, suggests a potential for a short-term correction or consolidation, despite the overall strong upward trend.  A rapid decline is possible given the overbought conditions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates significantly quarter to quarter, with a peak in Q4 2023 ($119.58B) and a subsequent drop.
* **EPS:** Similar volatility, with a high in Q2 2024 ($2.19) and a subsequent drop.
* **Comparison:**  There's no consistent upward or downward trend readily apparent.  Further information, such as analyst expectations, would be needed to determine whether these were beats or misses.  The duplicated entry for 2024-08-02 should be clarified for accurate analysis.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profit Margin:** Revenue shows significant fluctuation, but the profit margin remains relatively stable around 46%, suggesting consistent profitability despite revenue volatility.
* **Equity & ROE:**  Equity fluctuates, with ROE being highly volatile, ranging from 25.88% to 45.77%.  This indicates variability in the efficiency of using shareholder equity to generate profits.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook is provided.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing.  This section requires additional information.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL shows strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent indicators suggest caution. While the long-term outlook appears positive based on the provided expected return, the extremely overbought RSI (92.47) indicates a high risk of a short-term correction.  Earnings show significant quarter-to-quarter variation, requiring further analysis with analyst expectations for a complete picture.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits the scope of this overall assessment.  The provided Beta values of 0.0 are suspect and should be verified.  The high expected return should be treated with extreme caution due to the extremely overbought conditions highlighted by the RSI and the volatility in earnings.
