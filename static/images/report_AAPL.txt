## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 361.77%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.62%. The difference is 244.1%, placing it at the 90.9th percentile of historical divergence based on the provided data.  This indicates AAPL's substantial outperformance relative to the broader market over the period considered. The provided alpha values of 0.0 throughout the years suggest that the outperformance might not be solely attributable to factors captured by the market beta.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $245.00
* **5-day Moving Average:** $246.97
* **20-day Moving Average:** $249.99
* **60-day Moving Average:** $237.13

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.99 – This indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to the oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -0.75 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -7.7% –  This confirms the short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 54.1% – This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 with a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy.  This high expected return should be viewed cautiously given the high current relative performance and the inherent uncertainty of future returns.

The current price of $245.00, while slightly below recent moving averages, doesn't indicate a significant sudden drop (no evidence of a "crash"). The price action appears to be a moderate correction within a larger uptrend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows volatility in both revenue and EPS.  While the revenue generally fluctuates, a significant drop is observed between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 ($119.58B to $85.78B), followed by modest increases in subsequent quarters.  EPS also shows similar fluctuations.  Without access to expected values, it's impossible to assess whether these results represent beats or misses.  It is noteworthy that the August 2024 EPS is reported twice with the same value, suggesting a potential data entry error.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue has shown fluctuations, with a significant peak in Q4 2023. Profit margins are relatively stable, hovering around 46%.  Equity and ROE figures also exhibit variability, with ROE significantly higher in Q4 2023 compared to subsequent quarters. This suggests potential seasonality in Apple's performance, with Q4 2023 being a particularly strong period.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, as evidenced by its substantially higher cumulative return. However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction.  Technical indicators point to neither strong bullish nor bearish signals.  Earnings data displays variability in both revenue and EPS, with a notable revenue drop between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.  Financial information shows stable profit margins and fluctuating equity and ROE, suggesting some seasonality. The extremely high projected excess return compared to S&P 500 over the next two years needs to be interpreted with caution given that it's based on past performance.  Further investigation into recent news, analyst opinions, and the discrepancies noted in the earnings data is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  Missing information in several sections (news, analyst opinions) limits the completeness of this analysis.
