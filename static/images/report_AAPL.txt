**6. Overall Analysis:**

Apple (AAPL) has historically demonstrated significantly stronger performance than the S&P 500 (VOO), as evidenced by its substantially higher cumulative return and relative divergence.  Positive alpha values and strong CAGR suggest superior risk-adjusted returns.  While recent price action suggests a potential short-term downtrend, positive technical indicators (RSI, PPO) and a high expected return suggest long-term bullish potential.  Revenue and profitability remain strong, although some seasonality is observed. However,  a more in-depth analysis incorporating more data points (for earnings and financial statements) is necessary for a more comprehensive and accurate conclusion.  The provided data suggests that AAPL's long-term prospects remain strong,  but further due diligence is warranted before making any investment decisions.
