## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Overview and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL (341.04%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (116.43%) over the analyzed period. The difference in cumulative returns is 224.6%, placing it at the 84.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 341% further underscores this strong outperformance.  A maximum drawdown (MDD) of 35.9% indicates a relatively moderate level of risk compared to the substantial returns.  The alpha of 225% suggests significant outperformance relative to the benchmark, while a beta of 0.0 implies no correlation with the market's movements (This Beta value seems unusually low and requires further investigation of data validity and methodology). The market capitalization is substantial at $3462 Billion.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $234.0
* **Last Market Price:** $230.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $235.28 (slightly above the current price, suggesting recent downward pressure)
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $246.50 (significantly above the current price, indicating a potential downtrend)
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $237.84 (slightly above the current price, suggesting a similar trend as the 5-day)


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 19.19  (Deeply oversold, suggesting potential for a bounce, but also high risk)
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.947 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.0% (Short-term bearish trend)

The significantly lower last market price ($230.03) compared to the closing price indicates a recent price drop. However, the low RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, potentially setting the stage for a price rebound. However, the negative PPO and other indicators suggest caution.  The projected expected return of 64.7% over the long term (2+ years) represents a substantial potential outperformance against the S&P 500, contingent upon the sustained growth trajectory. This high expected return should be considered in the context of the inherent risks.

**7. Summary:**

Apple (AAPL) shows strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests a bearish short-term trend, indicated by moving averages and technical indicators.  While the stock is currently oversold (RSI), the negative PPO and recent earnings data suggest caution.  The high projected long-term expected return is promising but needs to be balanced against the identified risks and potential for volatility.  The unusually low beta value warrants further investigation. A thorough due diligence process, including examination of the company's fundamentals and overall market conditions, is recommended before any investment decision.  The duplicated data points require clarification and correction.
