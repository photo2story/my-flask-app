## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.  The cumulative return of AAPL (397.93%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (129.75%) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns is 268.2%, placing it at the 96.9th percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The provided alpha values consistently remain positive, suggesting AAPL's returns are exceeding market expectations.  The beta values indicate a degree of market sensitivity.  However, the high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across all periods demonstrates strong historical growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $242.65
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $237.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $229.64
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $228.11

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 85.31 – This extremely high RSI suggests the stock is significantly overbought, indicating potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.69 – A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (-) – The lack of data prevents an assessment.
* **Expected Return:** 229.7% – This represents a significant projected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  Given the high RSI and potential for correction, this should be interpreted cautiously.  A price of $242.63 (close to the last market price), while above the moving averages, doesn't necessarily signal a sudden dramatic upward movement (e.g., a steep surge); however, the elevated RSI warns of potential vulnerability to downward pressure.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Apple demonstrates exceptional historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, the current extremely high RSI suggests a potential near-term correction is likely. The recent earnings data reveal inconsistency in revenue and EPS growth.  While long-term growth potential remains substantial (supported by historical data and high expected return), investors should proceed with caution, considering the overbought condition, the fluctuating financial metrics, and a need for further research into recent news and analyst sentiment before making investment decisions.  A more detailed analysis of the recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for informed decision-making.
