## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.  The provided data shows significantly higher returns for AAPL compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **AAPL Cumulative Return:** 308.29%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 88.48%
* **Return Difference:** 219.8% (Relative Divergence: 70.5%)  This indicates AAPL significantly outperformed the S&P 500, exceeding the average outperformance across the historical period.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals consistently positive Alpha values, suggesting AAPL's outperformance is not solely due to market movements (Beta).  The increasing CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over the years further supports this observation.  However, the high maximum drawdown (MDD) values warrant caution, indicating substantial risk involved.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) increased steadily over the period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $205.35
* **Previous Close:** $213.32
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $210.50
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $199.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $219.30

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The recent drop of $3.74 (1.75%) shows a notable negative change in the price and indicates a recent negative price movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.61 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.07 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.4% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 114.7% (Significant outperformance over S&P 500 expected over 2+ years).  This should be interpreted with caution.

The recent price drop (-$3.74) could be interpreted as a normal market fluctuation given the relative strength and medium risk indicators.  However, consistent monitoring is recommended.

Further investigation is needed to resolve the duplicated earnings data entry.  The provided data suggests a strong company with a history of growth but investing involves risk, and the provided data alone is insufficient to make a conclusive investment decision.  Thorough due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.
