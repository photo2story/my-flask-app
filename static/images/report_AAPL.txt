**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's a noticeable dip in Q2 2024 in both EPS and revenue. Q1 2024 shows strong numbers, followed by the lower Q2, and then a recovery (or at least less of a drop) in Q3 2024.  The data needs further analysis, but the consistent revenue numbers suggest stability in the business.  There appears to be a duplicated entry for 2024-08-02.  The discrepancy needs to be resolved to provide meaningful analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL shows a strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent price action indicates a potential downtrend.  Oversold conditions (RSI) suggest a possible short-term bounce, but negative PPO and the downward trend suggest caution.  The high expected return should be considered in the context of the current market sentiment and potential risks.  Further investigation into the discrepancies in the data (earnings and closing vs market price) is crucial before drawing definitive conclusions.  The fundamental financial picture, while exhibiting some fluctuations, shows a generally healthy and profitable company.  The long-term outlook for AAPL remains positive due to its strong brand, significant market share, and innovation capabilities but requires monitoring of macroeconomic factors.
