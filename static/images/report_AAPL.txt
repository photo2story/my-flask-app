The Hybrid Signal indicates a purchase, but the overbought RSI suggests waiting for a potential pullback before increasing positions. The long-term expected return is highly attractive, making AAPL a potentially rewarding investment for patient investors. Monitor market sentiment regarding the AI sector and any significant news impacting Apple's earnings or product pipeline.
