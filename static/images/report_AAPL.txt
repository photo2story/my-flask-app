**6. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has shown significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 over the analyzed periods, with a high relative divergence.  However, the recent price decline and relatively high beta suggest market sensitivity. While the long-term expected return is substantial (112.2%), this should be viewed cautiously, considering the inherent risks.  Further research into the drivers of recent earnings volatility and a thorough examination of the balance sheet and cash flow statements would provide a more comprehensive understanding of AAPL's financial health and future prospects.  The inconsistent and potentially duplicated earnings data necessitates clarification and correction for reliable analysis.  The high Alpha and Beta highlight potential for outperformance but also susceptibility to market downturns. The technical indicators suggest a near-term bearish trend, while long-term projections remain bullish, assuming current trends persist.
