## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 376.22%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.78%.  The difference is 254.4%, placing it at the 100th percentile of the historical range of divergence between AAPL and VOO. This indicates AAPL's exceptional performance relative to the broader market over the measured period.  The provided alpha values of 0.0 across all periods suggest that the excess return is not necessarily attributable to active management skill, but more likely reflects the company's inherent characteristics.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $251.04
* **Last Market Price:** $252.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $248.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $239.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $231.78

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively small gap between the closing and last market price indicates minimal recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 92.47 – This extremely high RSI value suggests the stock is significantly overbought and potentially due for a correction.
* **PPO:** 0.396 – A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum, though the magnitude is not exceptionally strong.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8 – This positive change confirms short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 202.1% – This represents a substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, assuming the current trend continues. However, given the overbought RSI, this forecast should be treated with caution. The 252.21 price is not significantly higher than other data points; there's no indication of a sudden price surge or drop.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a volatile pattern in both revenue and EPS:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates significantly quarter to quarter, with a high of $119.58B in Q4 2023 and a low of $81.80B in Q1 2024.
* **EPS:** Similarly volatile, ranging from $1.27 to $2.19, indicating inconsistent performance and likely market factors impacting profitability.  There's a duplicate entry for 2024-08-02.  This inconsistency needs clarification.

Without expectations data, it's impossible to determine if earnings "beat" or "missed" expectations. The trend is not clearly upward or downward.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is inconsistent, but profit margins remain relatively stable around 46%, suggesting strong operational efficiency.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows some fluctuation, while ROE is highly variable, ranging from 25.88% to 45.77%.  This volatility needs further investigation to determine the underlying causes.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to be completed.  Please provide this data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the given period.  However, the extremely high RSI indicates the stock is overbought and potentially vulnerable to a correction.  While long-term projections suggest continued outperformance, this should be considered in light of the current overbought condition and the volatile nature of recent earnings.  Revenue and EPS show inconsistency, requiring further investigation into the underlying factors driving these fluctuations.  The provided financial information suggests strong profit margins but fluctuating equity and ROE, needing further analysis.  Completing the "News and Recent Issues" section will add crucial context to the overall assessment.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the overbought conditions and the need for further investigation into recent earnings and market sentiment, a cautious approach is warranted. While the long-term outlook remains positive based on historical performance, investors should carefully monitor the market and the company's performance to mitigate the risk of a potential correction.  Further research into the duplicated earnings data entry is also recommended.  Additional news and analyst opinions are needed to provide more conclusive recommendations.
