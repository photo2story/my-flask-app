## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 319.89%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 52.12%. The difference in cumulative returns is 267.78%.  The relative divergence indicates AAPL's performance is at the 70.7th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500, suggesting strong outperformance.


The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows consistent high growth for AAPL over the past few years, significantly exceeding the market's performance. The Alpha consistently being 1.0 indicates that AAPL has outperformed the market, and the Beta, while fluctuating, reflects a higher than average sensitivity to market movements, but given the consistent Alpha, it's a positive indicator of outperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $222.78
* **5-day Moving Average:** $224.58
* **20-day Moving Average:** $239.31
* **60-day Moving Average:** $237.06

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.  The price has also recently decreased slightly (-$0.39) from the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 23.88 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.02 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -5.8% –  This shows a recent short-term downward trend.

The combination of a low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the price being below its moving averages, indicates a bearish short-term outlook. However, the expected return of 120.3% over the long term (2+ years) suggests significant potential for outperformance relative to the S&P 500,  assuming a long-term investment approach.  The recent slight price drop is not significant enough to suggest a dramatic shift in the outlook.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility. While revenue generally shows growth, EPS shows fluctuations. Notably, there's a repetition of the 2024-08-02 data. Assuming this is an error, the overall trend reveals a potential slowdown in earnings per share (EPS) from the peak in Q2 2024, which could be a factor in the current price dip. A more detailed analysis is required to understand the factors behind these fluctuations.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-08-02 | $1.4   | $85.78B       |
| 2024-05-03 | $1.53  | $90.75B       |
| 2024-02-02 | $2.19  | $119.58B      |
| 2023-08-04 | $1.27  | $81.80B       |


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates but maintains a relatively high level.  Profit margins remain consistently high around 45-46%, suggesting strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity fluctuates quarter to quarter but generally remains high. Return on Equity (ROE) also shows fluctuations, potentially reflecting the impact of different investments and market conditions. A decline is notable in Q3 2024 (Sep 30).


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL shows strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 historically. However, the short-term outlook appears bearish, with the stock currently trading below its moving averages and exhibiting negative momentum indicators.  The recent earnings report suggests potential near-term challenges, but the long-term outlook, supported by the high expected return, remains positive for long-term investors.  Further investigation into the reasons behind recent earnings fluctuations and a thorough analysis of the market conditions are recommended.  The oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, but this should be considered within the context of the overall bearish short-term trend.
