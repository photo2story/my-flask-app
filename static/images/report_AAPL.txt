**6. Overall Analysis:**

Apple has shown strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While the current price is below its moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend, the RSI suggests the stock may be oversold.  The company exhibits high and consistent profit margins and generally strong financial health, although there are fluctuations in ROE and revenue across quarters. The long-term expected return remains high, suggesting potential for continued growth despite short-term market dynamics.  However,  it's crucial to consider the potential risks indicated by the medium market risk indicator and the significant drawdowns observed in the past.  A comprehensive analysis incorporating macro-economic factors and Apple's competitive landscape is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The duplication in the earnings data requires clarification.
