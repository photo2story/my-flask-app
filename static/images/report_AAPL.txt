**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is approaching oversold territory.  The negative PPO confirms the short-term bearish trend. The recent decline in relative divergence indicates short-term underperformance. The Hybrid Signal suggests a buy recommendation based on a 'very safe' assessment with MRI:0.90.  The significantly high Expected Return indicates very high confidence in AAPL's future growth potential compared to S&P 500 over a 2+ year period. The price increase of 0.97 from the previous close might indicate a potential quick reaction to news, but the overall trend needs further observation.

Keep a close watch on earnings, revenue trends, and any news related to key suppliers like TSM. The analyst consensus (Buy) and strong financials support a generally positive long-term outlook.
