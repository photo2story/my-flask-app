## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 372.84%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 125.68%.  The difference is 247.16%, placing it at the 89.83rd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided data). This indicates AAPL has historically outperformed the market significantly.  The provided alpha consistently above 1 further supports this outperformance.  Beta values indicate a higher-than-average volatility compared to the market (but this is relative; the S&P 500 is the benchmark).  Note that past performance is not indicative of future results.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $229.0 (Last Market: $228.66)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $227.7
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $227.0
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $226.61

The stock price is currently trading slightly above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a modestly bullish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 56.67 (Neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral trend)
* **PPO:** 0.13 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -3.33 (Short-term weakening of relative strength)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 35.32% (This represents expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming continued historical trends; this is a significant caveat)

The relatively recent decline in the 20-day relative divergence, despite a positive PPO, suggests a potential short-term correction. The closing price of $228.66 is not drastically different from the average, so neither a sharp upturn nor downturn is particularly suggested.  The high expected return is heavily based on past performance and should be interpreted cautiously.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows some fluctuation.  Revenue has generally increased, although there was a dip in the most recent quarters.  EPS reflects a similar pattern, though the most recent quarter shows a dip compared to previous ones.  To fully assess the recent financial performance, it is important to compare actual figures to analyst expectations for each reported quarter.   The data lacks the crucial context of analyst expectations and the overall market environment during these periods.


**5.  Financial Information Analysis (Revenue & Profitability & Capital & Profitability):**

Both revenue and profit margins are relatively stable and consistently high. Profitability is strong, indicated by the healthy profit margins. Return on Equity (ROE) exhibits some fluctuation but remains generally high, suggesting efficient use of shareholder equity. Note that there is a sharp dip in Revenue, profit margin and ROE in the latest reporting quarter.  Further investigation into the causes of these changes is necessary.

**8. Overall Summary:**

AAPL has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, showing substantial growth.  However, recent financial reports show a decline in certain key performance indicators. Short-term indicators provide a mixed outlook, with slightly bullish price action tempered by a weakening relative strength.  Long-term prospects appear positive based on past performance, but this is heavily dependent on whether the company can continue to demonstrate consistent growth and profitability. The high expected return is highly speculative and relies heavily on the continuation of past trends,  requiring thorough investigation to determine its validity.  Crucially, the analysis is incomplete without real-time news and analyst data on recent performance, financial projections, and future plans.  The inclusion of analyst expectations for each quarter's performance is also key for a complete picture.
