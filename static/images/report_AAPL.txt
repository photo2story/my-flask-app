## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 333.47%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.37%.  The difference is 215.1%, placing it at the 81st percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data (max: 270.7, min: -21.2).  This indicates a substantially higher return than the benchmark index.  The alpha consistently shows 0.0 in the provided data suggesting the outperformance may be attributable to factors outside the model.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $229.98
* **5-day Moving Average:** $232.76
* **20-day Moving Average:** $245.04
* **60-day Moving Average:** $237.64

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-to-medium term.  The recent price change of $0.75 (0.33%) is a relatively small upward movement, not indicating a significant "sudden rebound" or "sudden decline".

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 18.38 (Extremely oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.07 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -6.5% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 70.6% (Significant outperformance of S&P 500 over 2+ years)

The low RSI and negative PPO values suggest the stock is oversold and experiencing bearish momentum.  However, the high expected return, if realized, suggests a positive long-term outlook.  The combination of these signals warrants careful consideration and potentially justifies a long-term investment strategy.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-08-02 | $1.40 | $85.78B     |
| 2024-05-03 | $1.53 | $90.75B     |
| 2024-02-02 | $2.19 | $119.58B    |
| 2023-08-04 | $1.27 | $81.80B     |
| 2024-08-02 | $1.27 | $81.80B     | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Earnings show some volatility.  There's a significant drop in EPS and revenue in August 2024 compared to previous quarters.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying drivers of this volatility.  A single data point is unreliable.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $94.93B    | 46.22%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $85.78B    | 46.26%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $90.75B    | 46.58%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $119.58B   | 45.87%        |
| 2023-09-30  | $89.50B    | 45.17%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE          |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $56.95B    | 25.88%       |
| 2024-06-30  | $66.71B    | 32.15%       |
| 2024-03-31  | $74.19B    | 31.86%       |
| 2023-12-31  | $74.10B    | 45.77%       |
| 2023-09-30  | $62.15B    | 36.94%       |


Profit margins remain relatively stable and high. However, there's a noticeable decline in equity and ROE in the latest quarter (2024-09-30), requiring further investigation into potential causes.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, as shown by the substantially higher cumulative return.  While recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, technical indicators show the stock is oversold.  The projected high long-term return is attractive. However, recent earnings and financial data show some volatility and a decrease in key metrics in the latest quarter.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind these fluctuations.  A long-term investor with a high-risk tolerance might consider AAPL, recognizing the potential risks associated with the recent performance downturn and the need for further due diligence.  The alpha of 0.0 should be investigated further to determine why the company has consistently outperformed the index while having an alpha of zero.
