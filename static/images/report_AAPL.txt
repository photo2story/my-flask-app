2025-01-12 - Analysis Report
## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The final cumulative return difference is 234.2%, indicating a substantial outperformance.  The relative divergence of 87.5% shows that this outperformance is in the top percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  The provided alpha values consistently show zero, suggesting that the outperformance may be driven by factors other than those captured by the market index and beta.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for AAPL across various periods, ranging from 35% to 299%.  However, the Alpha is consistently reported as 0. This suggests that standard market models fail to capture the sources of Apple’s excess returns. This could be attributed to factors such as company-specific events, unforeseen market shifts, or limitations of the model used for alpha calculation.  The Beta values aren't consistent and are not provided for all periods, precluding a proper analysis of the stock's volatility relative to the market. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has consistently grown over time, reflecting the company's overall growth and success.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) shows significant fluctuations, highlighting the inherent risk associated with investing in AAPL, despite its impressive returns.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $236.85
* **5-day Moving Average:** $242.02
* **20-day Moving Average:** $249.21
* **60-day Moving Average:** $237.71

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 35.03 – This indicates that the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price increase. However, this should be considered alongside other factors.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.97 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.0% –  Short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 59.2% –  This represents a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term assuming current trends continue.  This however is a prediction only, and the actual result may differ.  The current price of $236.85 is not significantly above or below previous levels to suggest a sudden price jump or significant drop.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There appears to be a decreasing trend in revenue from Q4 2023 to Q2 2024 followed by a slight increase in Q3 2024. The EPS shows similar fluctuation. Duplicate data is present for 2024-08-02; this should be clarified. A more complete picture would require additional historical data.


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability data show fluctuations, indicating the challenges of the business environment in the last year.  Profit margins remain consistently high, showcasing Apple's strong pricing power and efficiency.  The fluctuations in equity and ROE need further investigation into the underlying factors.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has demonstrated significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 over the past several years. While the current price is slightly below its moving averages and some technical indicators point towards a short-term bearish trend, the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by high profit margins and significant expected returns. However, the high MDD values indicate a considerable level of risk. The data discrepancies (duplicate entries) and lack of complete beta data for all periods necessitate a more thorough investigation using broader data sets and additional analytical approaches. Further analysis is needed to interpret the meaning of the consistently reported Alpha value of zero.
