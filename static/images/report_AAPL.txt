**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Compound Annual Growth Rate. Shows Apple's growth over various 3-year periods, with significant growth spikes.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown, indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period, all consistently high, indicating substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Measures outperformance relative to the benchmark. Apple consistently shows high alpha, especially in the 2018-2021 period, indicating significant value added by the company beyond market returns, but recently decreased.
*   **Beta:** Measures volatility relative to the market. Beta is generally low, suggesting Apple is less volatile than the overall market, but recently increased. A negative Beta for the period 2015-2018 is odd and warrants further investigation into the data's accuracy.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 272.19

*   **20-day SMA:** 277.1745
*   **60-day SMA:** 266.9058

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 60-day SMA, but below both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs. This suggests a short-term downward trend, but a potential for support around the 60-day SMA. The small change from the previous close suggests relatively stable trading in the very recent period.

**3. Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 37.55
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.55
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.6 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 98.8% (Excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests moderate risk, but still within an acceptable range for investment.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is below 40, indicating that the stock may be oversold and could potentially rebound.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming a potential short-term downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  This signal suggests a strong buy recommendation, likely based on a combination of factors including the high MRI (presumably based on a different calculation or timeframe).
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Reinforces the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** A high expected return compared to the S&P 500 indicates a bullish long-term outlook.
