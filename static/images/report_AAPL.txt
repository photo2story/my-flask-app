*   **CAGR:** Compound Annual Growth Rate
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown (risk metric). High MDD values in recent years suggest heightened volatility and potential for significant losses.
*   **Alpha:** Outperformance vs. benchmark.  Notice the recent negative Alpha.
*   **Beta:**  Volatility relative to the market. Beta values near 0 or negative values suggest that the stock's price movements are less correlated with the market, potentially offering some diversification benefits.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in Billions

*Analysis:*

*   The recent period (2023-2025) shows a negative Alpha, indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark during that time. This is consistent with the cumulative return data.
*   Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values are quite high in recent periods (68.7% to 71.7%), indicating significant potential losses during those periods. This high volatility may be a concern for risk-averse investors.
*   Beta values are generally low (close to 0 or negative), suggesting that AAPL's price movements are less correlated with the overall market. This could be attractive for investors looking for diversification.
*   CAGR has been strong in some periods, such as 2022-2024 (43.0%) and 2021-2023 (25.0%), but lower in other periods, such as 2020-2022 (-9.0%).

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 226.01
*   **Previous Close:** 230.56
*   **Change:** -1.97 (-1.97%) - *This is a notable negative change from the previous close.  Suggests some selling pressure in the very short term.*
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 230.37
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 219.14
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 209.60

*Analysis:* The price is below the 5-day moving average, suggesting short-term downward momentum.  However, the price is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating that the medium-term and longer-term trends are still positive. The gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages suggests a relatively strong upward trend in recent months, but the recent price decline could signal a potential shift in momentum.

### 3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3316 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 68.95 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.37
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.32)
*   **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** 4.1 (Positive - short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 128.0% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

*Analysis:*

*   **MRI:**  The low-risk MRI is a positive sign.
*   **RSI:** The RSI approaching 70 suggests the stock may be nearing overbought conditions, potentially indicating a pullback or consolidation.
*   **PPO:** The PPO is an oscillator that measures the percentage difference between two moving averages. The exact signal is difficult to interpret without context of history
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The hybrid signal recommends a strong buy, which contradicts the negative data of the past week(from 230.56 to 226.01)
*   **20-day Relative Divergence Change:**  The positive change in relative divergence suggests the stock may be starting to gain ground against the S&P 500, but a negative return of -1.97% contradicts the divergence metric
*   **Expected Return:** The significantly high expected return is a strong bullish signal but should be considered carefully.  It suggests that the model predicts significant outperformance over the S&P 500 with a long-term investment horizon.

### 7. 종합 Analysis

*   **Mixed Signals:**  The data presents a mixed picture. AAPL has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, and the RSI suggests it may be nearing overbought territory. However, the MRI indicates low market risk.
*   **Volatility:** The high MDD in recent years points to increased volatility, which investors should be aware of.
*   **Long-Term Potential:** The extraordinarily high expected return (128%) suggests significant potential for long-term outperformance. This, coupled with the low Beta, might appeal to investors seeking long-term growth with potentially lower market correlation. However, this figure should be viewed cautiously, as it is a model-based prediction.
*   **Earnings & Financial Health:** Apple's revenue and profitability remain strong, with consistent profit margins. The ROE fluctuates but generally indicates healthy profitability relative to shareholder equity.
*   **News Impact:** The recent news highlights volatility and active market discussion, suggesting that investors should closely monitor company announcements and industry trends. The recent market reaction of -1.97% should also be closely monitored.

**Recommendation:**

Given the contradictory signals, a cautious approach is warranted. While the long-term expected return is enticing, recent underperformance, high volatility, and the mixed technical indicators suggest that investors should proceed with caution.

*   **Monitor the stock's price action closely,** paying attention to support and resistance levels.
*   **Stay informed about company announcements,** industry trends, and economic factors.
*   **Consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy** to mitigate the risk of short-term volatility, especially given the recommendation to invest.
*   **Re-evaluate the investment thesis** if there are significant changes in the company's fundamentals or the overall market conditions.
