**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR is highly variable, with significant growth periods (e.g., 2018-2020, 2019-2021) and periods of slower growth (e.g., 2022-2024).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is consistently high, indicating substantial potential for temporary losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Apple consistently exhibits positive Alpha, except for 2022-2024. This suggests the stock generally outperforms its expected return based on its risk (Beta).  The Alpha values vary significantly, indicating different levels of outperformance in different periods.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally low (between 0-0.6), suggesting that AAPL has been historically less volatile than the overall market (S&P 500). A beta of 0.6 means for every 1% move in the S&P 500, Apple tends to move 0.6% in the same direction.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):**  Market capitalization has generally increased significantly over the periods, with some volatility.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 273.67
*   **Last-market:** Price: 273.67, Previous Close: 272.19, Change: 0.54
*   **5-day SMA:** 273.28
*   **20-day SMA:** 277.55
*   **60-day SMA:** 267.19

**Analysis:** The stock price closed slightly higher than the previous day. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which in turn is above the 60-day SMA. This *could* suggest a short-term downtrend or consolidation within a longer-term uptrend. However, the difference between the SMAs is relatively small, so this is not a strong signal. The closing price of 273.67 is below the 20-day SMA, which could suggest some short-term bearishness.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 23.71
*   **PPO:** -0.52
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00). (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.6 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 98.8% (Over 2 years, compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A reading of 0.7 indicates a medium level of risk, suggesting that the current market conditions are moderately favorable for investment, according to this indicator.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 23.71 indicates that the stock is *oversold*. This often suggests a potential for a price rebound.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of -0.52 suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, which *could* indicate a potential downtrend, but it's a weak signal.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The hybrid signal suggests a "Buy" recommendation, allocated 100% of available cash into AAPL, while emphasizing "Very Safe" investment.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence (-1.6) reinforces the idea of a recent short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 98.8% (over 2 years compared to S&P 500) is very high and should be viewed with caution. It suggests a potentially very optimistic outlook.
