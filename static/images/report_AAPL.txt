**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 38.0% | 11.0% | 9.0% | -0.1 | 597.4 |
| 2016-2018  | 42.0% | 61.6% | 24.0% | -0.0 | 565.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 107.0% | 61.6% | 78.0% | 0.8 | 1068.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 230.0% | 62.6% | 204.0% | 0.4 | 1947.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 315.0% | 62.6% | 260.0% | 0.3 | 2621.6 |
| 2020-2022  | 96.0% | 69.1% | 90.0% | 0.2 | 1929.4 |
| 2021-2023  | 44.0% | 69.2% | 27.0% | 0.5 | 2874.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 52.0% | 70.8% | 35.0% | 0.5 | 3757.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 33.0% | 81.8% | 19.0% | 0.6 | 3042.3 |

The alpha values show periods of both outperformance (positive alpha) and underperformance (negative alpha) relative to the benchmark.  Beta values generally indicate moderate sensitivity to market movements, although some periods show less sensitivity (beta near 0).  The significant increase in market capitalization over the years reflects company growth. Note that Alpha values seem unusually high compared to CAGR.  Further investigation into the calculation methodology would be beneficial.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $202.52
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $192.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $208.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $224.85

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price increase of $2.21 (Last-market data) represents a small positive change, but it doesn't negate the overall downtrend indicated by the moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.76 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so.)
* **PPO:** -0.3769 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum.)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +6.8% (Short-term upward movement.)
* **Expected Return:** 106.5% (This represents a significant expected outperformance over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if the predicted return materializes).  The provided data does not specify how this expected return was calculated, which is a limitation.


The recent price increase, while positive, is within the context of a broader bearish trend suggested by moving averages and PPO. The high MRI indicates relatively high risk. The relatively low RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, but more factors need to be considered for a complete assessment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | 2.41  | $124.30 B     |
| 2024-08-02 | 1.40  | $85.78 B     |
| 2024-05-03 | 1.53  | $90.75 B     |
| 2024-02-02 | 2.19  | $119.58 B     |
| 2025-01-31 | 2.19  | $119.58 B     | *(Note: Duplicate entry. Likely an error in data.)*

Revenue fluctuates throughout the year, with peaks in Q1 and Q4.  EPS follows a similar pattern.  There's a significant jump in revenue and EPS between Q1 2024 and Q4 2024. The duplicate entry for 2025-01-31 suggests a data error requiring correction before robust conclusions can be drawn.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $124.30B   | 46.88%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $94.93B    | 46.22%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $85.78B    | 46.26%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $90.75B    | 46.58%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $119.58B   | 45.87%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE          |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $66.76B    | 54.42%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $56.95B    | 25.88%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $66.71B    | 32.15%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $74.19B    | 31.86%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $74.10B    | 45.77%       |

Both revenue and profit margins remain relatively stable, indicating a healthy and consistent financial performance. ROE fluctuates but generally remains high, suggesting efficient use of equity.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has historically shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, as indicated by the large cumulative return difference and relative divergence. However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term bearish trend, despite a small recent price increase.  The high MRI suggests caution.  While long-term projections show high expected returns, these are predicated on several assumptions which were not clearly defined.  The financial statements show strong and consistent profitability, and the company's strong market position continues to generate substantial revenue.  Further investigation into the data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data, unexplained Alpha values, and the methodology behind the 106.5% expected return) is necessary before reaching definitive conclusions.  A thorough fundamental and technical analysis, along with a careful consideration of the broader market conditions, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
