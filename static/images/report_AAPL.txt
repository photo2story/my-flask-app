| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|

Revenue shows some fluctuation.  A thorough analysis requires more data and context, especially clarifying the duplicate entry for May 2025.  EPS also demonstrates variability, needing further investigation.


**5) Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This is a significant limitation.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

AAPL has historically demonstrated strong performance compared to the S&P 500, supported by high CAGR and generally positive alpha. However, recent price action suggests a short-term slowdown. While long-term prospects remain promising based on the expected return, the lack of complete financial data and the mixed technical indicators necessitate caution. Further investigation into the earnings data inconsistencies and the acquisition of complete financial statements are crucial for a more robust assessment.  The current data suggests a medium-risk investment with potentially high long-term rewards, but careful monitoring of short-term price movements is advised.
