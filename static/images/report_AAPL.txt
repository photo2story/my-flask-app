The cumulative return of AAPL is 384.24%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.56%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 266.68%.  The provided relative divergence metric of 100.0% indicates AAPL's performance is at the highest point of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  Alpha consistently shows 0.0, suggesting the performance is mainly driven by market movements (Beta is not consistently reported). The high CAGR figures across the years reflect strong growth, although this has varied considerably.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $245.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $233.89

* **PPO:** 0.1985 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) indicating a recent slight downturn.
* **Expected Return:** 203.2% (This is a high figure;  further context on calculation methodology is needed for proper interpretation.  It represents a projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500 if the investment is made at the current price. The claim needs further justification)

The high RSI suggests potential overbought conditions and a possible short-term correction. However, the positive PPO indicates continued upward momentum.  The last market price of $258.20 is slightly higher than the closing price, but not indicative of a dramatic shift.
