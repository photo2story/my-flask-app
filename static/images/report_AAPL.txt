## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 341.79%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.47%.  The difference is 229.3%, placing it at the 85.8th percentile of the historical range of divergence (max: 270.7, min: -21.2).  This indicates AAPL has substantially outperformed the market over the period considered.

The provided Alpha values are consistently 0.0, suggesting that the outperformance isn't solely attributable to factors beyond market movements (alpha represents excess returns compared to a benchmark).  The high Beta values (not explicitly shown but implied by the significant CAGR figures and market correlation) indicate high sensitivity to overall market movements.  The consistently increasing market capitalization reflects the company's growth over the years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $234.40
* **5-day Moving Average:** $240.23
* **20-day Moving Average:** $248.60
* **60-day Moving Average:** $237.72

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (29.81):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is due.
* **PPO (-1.08):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (-4.5%):** Short-term weakening.

The current price of $234.40 is below the moving averages, not signaling a sharp rebound or decline; itâ€™s consistent with a short-term bearish trend.  The projected 62% long-term (2+ years) return, exceeding the S&P 500, shows strong long-term potential,  but this is still an *expected* return, subject to market fluctuations.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

There is inconsistency in the earnings data provided.  The table shows duplicate entries for 2024-08-02.  Assuming the first 2024-08-02 entry is correct, we observe a general decline in EPS and revenue in the recent quarters (though there's an apparent jump in Q4 2023).  More reliable data would be required for a more thorough analysis.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-08-02 | 1.40 | 85.78         |
| 2024-05-03 | 1.53 | 90.75         |
| 2024-02-02 | 2.19 | 119.58        |
| 2023-08-04 | 1.27 | 81.80         |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability, and Capital and Profitability tables show some volatility quarter-over-quarter. While revenue fluctuates, profit margins remain relatively consistent, suggesting efficient cost management.  Equity and ROE also show fluctuations, with a notable drop in Q1 2024, possibly influenced by seasonal factors or other operational matters. More context is needed for a conclusive analysis.


| Quarter     | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE    |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| 2024-09-30  | 94.93         | 46.22%        | 56.95        | 25.88% |
| 2024-06-30  | 85.78         | 46.26%        | 66.71        | 32.15% |
| 2024-03-31  | 90.75         | 46.58%        | 74.19        | 31.86% |
| 2023-12-31  | 119.58        | 45.87%        | 74.10        | 45.77% |
| 2023-09-30  | 89.50         | 45.17%        | 62.15        | 36.94% |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting strong historical growth.  However, current technical indicators point towards a short-term bearish trend.  While the long-term expected return is promising,  the recent earnings data requires clarification, and the recent financial information shows some volatility.  Investors should consider the short-term weakness alongside the impressive long-term potential, employing a well-diversified investment strategy.  Further research into the inconsistencies in the provided data is recommended before making any investment decisions.
