2025-01-17 - Analysis Report
## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL (341.04%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (116.43%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 224.6%, placing it at the 84.2nd percentile of the historical range of the difference between the two.  This indicates strong relative performance.  The Alpha of 225% further reinforces this exceptional outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  A beta of 0.0 suggests very little correlation with the overall market movement.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $234.00
* **Last Market Price:** $228.79
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $235.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $246.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $237.84

The stock is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it remains above its 60-day moving average, indicating a relatively stronger long-term trend. The recent drop to $228.79 from $234 could be interpreted as a minor pullback.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 19.20  (Significantly oversold, suggesting potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.95 (Negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -6.0% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 64.7% (Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500)

The low RSI suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. However, the negative PPO and negative relative divergence confirm a short-term bearish trend. The high expected return suggests significant long-term growth potential, exceeding the S&P 500's projected returns. The drop to $228.79, while not a dramatic drop, should be monitored for any sustained downward pressure.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Apple shows strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. While short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend, the oversold RSI and high expected return suggest a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors.  However, the recent earnings volatility and inconsistencies in the provided data require further investigation to fully assess the current market position and the long-term outlook.  Clarification on the duplicated data point in the earnings report is crucial.
