## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**0. Overview:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Apple's cumulative return (281.39%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (89.44%).  The difference is 192.0%, placing it at the 75th percentile of the historical range (max: 264.0, min: -23.5).  This indicates AAPL's substantial outperformance relative to the broader market over the observed period.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals varying performance relative to the market (S&P 500) across different years.  While Alpha is positive in most years, indicating outperformance, Beta values are consistently above 0.1 implying higher volatility than the S&P 500. The significantly high CAGR values, especially in 2017-2021, demonstrate strong growth. Note the substantial market capitalization (Cap(B)) increase over time.

Apple exhibits strong historical performance significantly exceeding the S&P 500. While recent price action shows some short-term weakness, long-term projections suggest substantial outperformance.  However, some data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) require clarification.  The high expected return coupled with reasonably stable financial performance and high profit margins makes it an attractive investment candidate.  Further due diligence, including a thorough analysis of the inconsistent data points and a deeper dive into the underlying drivers of ROE and equity fluctuations, is recommended.
