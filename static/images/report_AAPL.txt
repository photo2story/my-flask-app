## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 371.36%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) is 125.6%.  This represents a difference of 245.76%.  The relative divergence of 89.36% indicates that AAPL's performance significantly outpaces the S&P 500 based on historical data, placing it in the top 90th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this is a historical measure and doesn't predict future performance.

The provided alpha values consistently exceed 1, suggesting that AAPL has outperformed the market benchmark (S&P 500) over the analyzed periods.  The beta values, generally around 1.1-1.4, show that AAPL is more volatile than the market.  Market capitalization has grown significantly over the years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $228.28
* **5-day Moving Average:** $226.93
* **20-day Moving Average:** $227.07
* **60-day Moving Average:** $226.59

The stock price is slightly above its recent moving averages, suggesting a modestly positive short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.25 (Slightly below neutral; not oversold or overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.07 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, though weak)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.67% (Suggests a recent weakening in momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 35.29% (Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 expected over the long term)

The relatively low RSI and slightly negative recent relative divergence suggest caution, despite the positive PPO.  The 228.34 price is not significantly different from recent moving averages so there is no indication of a rapid price change (either up or down).  The high expected return is noteworthy but should be considered in the context of the inherent market risk.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue figures. While there's a general trend of growth, the figures for August 2024 (1.4 EPS and $85.78B revenue) are lower compared to previous quarters. Further context and comparison to analyst expectations for August 2024 results are needed for a thorough assessment.  The data suggests some revenue variability quarter-to-quarter.

**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability show strong and consistent profitability. However, there's fluctuation in specific metrics such as ROE (Return on Equity).  A deeper analysis should consider the factors driving these fluctuations.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

AAPL has demonstrated historically strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500, showing high cumulative returns and consistently positive alpha.  However, recent indicators (RSI, relative divergence change) suggest a potential slowdown in momentum.  The company shows strong financial performance based on the data, although recent reported earnings showed some decline compared to previous quarters.  The long-term outlook remains positive, with a substantial expected return exceeding the S&P 500.  However,  investors should monitor recent news, analyst opinions, and market sentiment for a more nuanced perspective.
