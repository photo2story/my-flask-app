## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 374.64%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 127.58%.  The difference is 247.06%, placing it at the 89.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates AAPL has substantially outperformed the market benchmark over the observed period.  The provided Alpha values consistently exceed 1, further supporting this superior performance compared to the market benchmark (Beta reflects market sensitivity).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $229.87 (Last Market: $229.76)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $228.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $226.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $226.65

The price is slightly above all three moving averages, suggesting a modestly positive short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (67.65):**  Indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (0.2):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -3.67%, indicating a recent slight downward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 35.38%  This represents a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.  The recent price of $229.76 doesn't signal a drastic change (no significant sudden jump or drop).

**4. Recent Financials and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally trended upward, there are fluctuations quarter-to-quarter.  The most recent EPS (1.4) is lower than the previous quarter (1.53), but the provided data lacks the predicted EPS value for comparison.   Further analysis of the entire dataset and comparing this data against analyst predictions would be necessary to provide a comprehensive assessment.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains strong, with profit margins consistently around 45-46%.  The quarter ending December 2023 shows significantly higher revenue and profit.  This suggests potential seasonality or possibly other factors driving this pattern which needs further investigation.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  ROE fluctuates but generally remains high, indicating good profitability relative to equity.  Again, further analysis is needed to understand the causes of the variations.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* *(This section requires accessing real-time news sources such as Shacknews and FINBOLD.  I cannot access real-time information.)* To complete this section, I would need to research recent news articles (within the last two days) for Apple Inc., focusing on earnings announcements, analyst ratings, and market outlook.  I would look for information related to the latest earnings report,  recent product launches or announcements, and any significant market events impacting Apple's stock.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, exhibiting strong growth and profitability.  However, recent data show some slowing in growth momentum and potentially an overbought condition, as suggested by the RSI. The relatively high expected return suggests a potentially attractive long-term investment, but careful consideration should be given to the recent decrease in growth rate, the slightly bearish short-term technical indicators (RSI and relative divergence) and the need for a full comparison of latest earnings versus predicted values.  Further research into recent news, analyst opinions, and a deeper dive into the financial data are crucial before making any investment decisions.
