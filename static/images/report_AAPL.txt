## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 375.04%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 115.09%.  The difference is 259.9%, placing it at the 96.3rd percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (max: 270.7%, min: -21.2%).  This indicates AAPL has substantially outperformed the market over the measured period.  The provided alpha values of 0.0 throughout the periods suggests that this outperformance is not necessarily due to factors independent of market movements, but rather potentially due to higher beta (market sensitivity).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $250.42
* **Last Market Price:** $243.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $255.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $249.81
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $236.20

The price is currently below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potentially stronger longer-term trend. The difference between the closing price and the last market price ($250.42 vs $243.15) signals a recent upward movement; however, a more detailed look at intraday trading activity is needed to determine whether this constituted a rapid surge.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.98 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.21 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.7% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 47.1% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500)

The relatively low PPO value and negative divergence indicate a potential short-term weakness, but the high expected return suggests a positive long-term outlook for the stock, exceeding that of the S&P 500 significantly.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows volatility in both EPS and revenue.

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates significantly quarter-to-quarter, with a peak of $119.58B in Q1 2024 and a low of $81.80B in Q4 2023.
* **EPS:** Also shows variability, reaching a high of $2.19 in Q1 2024 and a low of $1.27 in Q4 2023.  There is a duplicate entry for Q4 2024. This discrepancy needs clarification.

Without comparative expectations, it's impossible to definitively identify beats or misses.  The data suggests a cyclical pattern in both revenue and EPS.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue is relatively stable over the past year, with a notable drop in Q4 2023 followed by recovery.
* **Profit Margin:**  Maintains a high and relatively stable profit margin (45-46%) throughout the periods.
* **Equity:** Equity shows fluctuation, peaking in Q1 2024.
* **ROE:** ROE is also variable but remains at a consistently high level (above 25%), exceeding the average for most companies in most industries, indicative of strong profitability.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, with a high expected return.  However, recent price movements and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downturn.  While financial statements show strong profitability and relatively stable revenue, quarter-to-quarter fluctuation is present.  More information is needed regarding recent news, analyst opinions, and competitive landscape to provide a more complete assessment.
