2024-11-29 - Analysis Report
## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return for AAPL is 385.08%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%.  The difference is 256.2%, placing it at the 92.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance over the considered period.

The provided Alpha values consistently exceed 1, suggesting AAPL has generated returns above what would be expected based solely on its market beta (systematic risk).  Beta values generally hover around 1.5-1.9, indicating higher volatility than the overall market. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) demonstrates strong and consistent growth over the analyzed periods, although it fluctuates across different time frames.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) shows periods of significant price declines, but these are followed by recovery.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $234.93 (Last Market: $234.99)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $232.25
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $227.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $227.17

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average and significantly above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 68.02 -  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.45 - Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +0.5 - Indicates a recent short-term upward trend in relative performance against the S&P 500.

The closing price of $234.99 doesn't indicate a dramatic surge or decline.  The expected return of 238.8% (presumably a misprint and likely represents 23.88% or a different metric) needs clarification on its calculation and timeframe. The provided statement regarding long-term (2+ years) outperformance over the S&P 500 needs further details on the underlying model or assumption used to reach that conclusion.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates significantly across quarters. Q4 2023 shows the highest revenue, but Q1 2024 shows a notable decrease. This is followed by some recovery in subsequent quarters.
* **EPS:** Similar to revenue, EPS shows fluctuations. A significant peak in EPS is observed in Q1 2024, followed by a decline in the subsequent quarter.  The reported EPS for the most recent two quarters (2024-08-02 entries) appears to be duplicated. This inconsistency requires clarification.
* **Comparison:** There is no direct comparison with expectations as those are not provided, making definitive judgment on "beats" or "misses" impossible.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows seasonal variations, with Q4 2023 being the strongest. Profit margins remain relatively stable around 45-46%, suggesting consistent profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows some fluctuation. ROE (Return on Equity) is highly variable across quarters, with a significant peak in Q4 2023.  This requires further investigation to understand the underlying factors.

The data suggests profitable performance but with quarter-to-quarter fluctuations needing more context to fully understand.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent earnings news (within the last two days) is explicitly provided.  Missing information on market outlook, analyst opinions and performance highlights prevents a complete assessment.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, showing strong growth potential. However, recent earnings data reveals some volatility in both revenue and EPS. Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction, but the long-term trend appears positive.  Crucial missing information, including the clarification of contradictory data points, expectations for earnings and analyst opinions, hinders a complete and precise assessment.  The provided "expected return" requires substantial clarification.  Further analysis is needed to fully understand the underlying factors driving recent performance and potential future prospects.
