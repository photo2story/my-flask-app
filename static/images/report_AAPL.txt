## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 215.1%.  This places the relative divergence at the 81st percentile based on historical data, indicating strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

However, the provided data presents inconsistencies in the Alpha and Beta values. Further investigation is needed to ascertain their accuracy.
