Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return for AAPL is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 247.4%, placing it at the 99.3rd percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500 based on the provided data. This indicates AAPL has substantially outperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.  The provided alpha consistently shows 0.0, however, it's important to note this might only reflect the specific time frames considered within the analysis. Further investigation would be required for a more comprehensive view. Beta values are also shown to be significant, indicating a strong correlation with the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $246.75 (Last Market: $246.81)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $243.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $233.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $229.58

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day MA indicates recent price stability.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 96.02 – This extremely high RSI value suggests the stock is significantly overbought and potentially due for a correction.
* **PPO:** 0.63 – A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +4.9 – This confirms a short-term upward trend.

The provided 20-day relative divergence change of +4.9 indicates short-term upward momentum, although the extremely high RSI suggests caution.  Given the closing price of $246.81, there is no immediate evidence of significant up or down volatility.  The expected return of 202.6% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 indicates a substantial projected outperformance. This however, should be treated cautiously due to the inherent uncertainty in long-term predictions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows considerable volatility, with a significant peak in the quarter ending 2024-02-02 ($119.58B) followed by decreases.  However, the latest quarter at $85.78 Billion indicates a downward trend compared to the preceding two quarters.
* **EPS:** EPS also fluctuates, reaching a high of $2.19 in the quarter ending 2024-02-02 and declining subsequently.  The latest EPS is $1.27 (8/2/2024) the same as the quarter ending 2023-08-04.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has shown exceptionally strong performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided cumulative returns.  However, recent price action suggests potential overbought conditions (RSI = 96.02).  Earnings show significant volatility, with no clear consistent upward trend. The high long-term expected return should be viewed with caution due to inherent uncertainties.
