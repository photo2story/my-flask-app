While the relative divergence of 88.6% highlights substantial outperformance compared to its historical range against VOO, it's crucial to remember this is a relative measure against the S&P 500's performance and doesn't represent absolute outperformance in all market conditions.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over the years, with Alpha generally exceeding 0, suggesting outperformance compared to the benchmark (although the magnitude fluctuates).  Beta values generally remain above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) steadily increased over the period.  However, itâ€™s crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $240.79

The stock price is currently slightly below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend, but above its 20-day moving average indicating recent recovery.  The price is very close to its previous close, showing minimal daily change.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 58% (This represents significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. This projection is subject to market volatility and uncertainties.)  The small negative daily price change ('Last-market') doesn't indicate a significant event that would alter the overall outlook.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Apple has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, current indicators suggest potential short-term corrections. While long-term prospects appear positive, based on the provided expected return, the high RSI suggests caution.  Further analysis is needed to address data inconsistencies (duplicate entries in earnings data) and to compare Apple's performance against industry benchmarks and economic forecasts for a holistic assessment.  The significant fluctuation in quarterly earnings and ROE necessitates deeper examination of the underlying factors influencing these variations.  Investors should consider the volatility indicated by the beta value and the potential for short-term corrections before making investment decisions.  The long-term outlook is promising, subject to market conditions and future performance.
