**6) Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, showcasing strong long-term growth potential.  However, current technical indicators and recent price action suggest a potential short-term downturn. The high MRI and negative PPO raise concerns about market risk. Although the RSI suggests oversold conditions, this does not guarantee an immediate reversal.  Despite the negative short-term outlook, the projected long-term (2+ years) expected return remains very high, suggesting that a potential dip could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high-risk tolerance.  Further analysis of the earnings data and news impacting the recent price drop is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated earnings data point also requires clarification.
