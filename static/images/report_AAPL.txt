## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.  The provided data shows a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO).  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction, but long-term prospects remain positive, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** AAPL's cumulative return (283.24%) significantly outpaces VOO's (66.36%). The difference (216.9%) places it at the 71.6th percentile of historical divergence from VOO, indicating a substantial outperformance.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided table shows varying alpha and beta values across different periods.  While beta generally fluctuates around 0.5-1 (meaning Apple's price is moderately sensitive to market movements), Alpha (the excess return compared to the market) varies significantly from periods of underperformance (-0.1) to significant outperformance (0.8).  This suggests periods of both market-correlated returns and periods of significant company-specific performance drivers. Note the correlation between increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) and increased Alpha over the years.  This indicates potential for continued outperformance as the company grows.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $198.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $188.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $209.21
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $225.28

The closing price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term. The recent price jump of $4.06 (a positive change), however, might suggest short-term buying pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4715 (High Risk category).  This suggests caution despite potential upside.
* **RSI:** 40.06 (Slightly below the oversold threshold of 30).  While it's in oversold territory, it isn't extremely oversold, so the risk remains.
* **PPO:** -0.89 (Negative value indicating bearish momentum).
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** 2.6 (Positive, suggesting short-term upward momentum).
* **Expected Return:** 107.7% This represents a long-term (2+ years) expected outperformance of the S&P 500.

The relatively recent price jump of $4.06 might be interpreted as a brief upswing, but given the other indicators (MRI, RSI, PPO) this price jump might be temporary.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |

ROE fluctuates, but generally remains strong, reflecting Apple's ability to generate returns on its equity.  The significant drop in ROE during Q2 2024 aligns with the revenue and EPS dip, requiring further investigation.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Apple demonstrates consistent long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500. While short-term indicators suggest a potentially bearish trend, the high expected long-term return, strong financial performance (despite some recent quarter-to-quarter fluctuations), and historically high alpha values warrant further consideration.  The relatively high market risk indicator, however, signals a need for cautious monitoring and risk management strategies.  Further analysis into the Q2 2024 earnings dip is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The conflicting signals warrant a cautious approach, potentially leaning towards a long-term buy-and-hold strategy for investors with a high-risk tolerance.
