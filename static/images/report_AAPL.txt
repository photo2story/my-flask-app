2024-12-08 - Analysis Report
## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 360.66%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.19%.  The difference in cumulative returns between AAPL and VOO is 238.5%. This places AAPL at the 96th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data, indicating a substantial outperformance.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows consistent strong growth of AAPL over the past several years, significantly exceeding the market.  However, it's important to note that the Alpha is consistently reported as 0.0, suggesting that the outperformance may be primarily driven by market factors (Beta) rather than unique company-specific factors.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects Apple's growth.  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) numbers indicate periods of significant price declines, which should be considered alongside the high CAGR.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $242.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $242.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $232.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $229.18

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 95.84 – Extremely overbought, suggesting a potential short-term pullback is likely.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.61 – Positive, indicating upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +2.3 – Confirms a short-term uptrend.

The high RSI value (95.84) suggests the stock is significantly overbought and a correction is possible.  The closing price of $242.86, being very near the last market price, does not suggest a significant immediate jump or drop.  The projected expected return of 209.1% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is very high and should be treated with caution. Such a prediction depends on many factors and is not guaranteed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals some volatility in both EPS and Revenue.  While Revenue generally shows a strong upward trend, the most recent quarter (2024-08-02) shows a decrease in both revenue and EPS compared to the previous quarter (2024-05-03).  Revenue also dipped in 2023-08-04. A notable jump in revenue and EPS occurred during 2024-02-02, although the exact causes aren't provided.  There is no context for assessing whether any of these numbers are "beats" or "misses" versus expectations.  Without comparison data to predicted earnings, a true assessment of success or failure cannot be given.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Shows fluctuation, with a significant peak in the 2023-12-31 quarter. Overall, revenue generally remains high but not consistently rising.
* **Profit Margin:** Remains relatively stable around 46%, indicating consistent profitability.
* **Equity:** Fluctuates but remains substantial.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):**  Shows significant fluctuation, peaking at 45.77% in 2023-12-31 and declining afterwards.  This indicates variability in how efficiently the company is utilizing shareholder equity to generate profits.

This section requires information not provided in the data.  To complete this section, recent news articles, analyst reports, and market outlook information would be needed.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has shown exceptional long-term growth significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, the recent price action and RSI suggest an overbought condition, potentially leading to a short-term correction. While the fundamentals (Revenue and Profitability) generally look strong,  there's considerable variability in the data, particularly in EPS and ROE. The very high long-term expected return requires significant caution and should be considered in light of the inherent risks in any investment.  Additional information on recent news and analyst sentiment is crucial for a more complete picture.
