**6. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has shown exceptionally strong performance compared to the S&P 500, significantly exceeding market returns over the analyzed period.  While short-term indicators suggest potential for a minor correction (high RSI), long-term prospects look positive, supported by a strong expected return and generally healthy financial performance. However,  the volatility in earnings and ROE requires further analysis to fully understand the drivers behind Apple's financial health and long-term sustainability.  Additional factors beyond this analysis, including macroeconomic conditions, competitive landscape, and technological disruptions, should also be considered for a complete investment decision.  The duplicated earnings data point needs clarification.
