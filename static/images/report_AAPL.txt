**Analysis:** Profit margins remain relatively stable and high across the periods, indicating strong profitability.  However, revenue shows considerable volatility.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has shown exceptional long-term growth significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price movements suggest a potential short-term downtrend. While technical indicators (RSI) suggest oversold conditions, the negative PPO and downward moving averages point to bearish momentum.  The high expected return suggests continued strong long-term potential.  Earnings data exhibits volatility, requiring further investigation to identify the underlying drivers.  Financial statements show strong profitability but significant variability in revenue and ROE.  A more thorough fundamental analysis is needed, considering macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape, to arrive at a conclusive investment recommendation.  The discrepancies in the provided data (duplicate earnings entry) need resolution.
