## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return for AAPL is 384.24%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 117.56%.  The difference in cumulative return is 266.7%, placing it at the 100th percentile of the historical relative divergence range (max: 266.7, min: -21.2).  This indicates a substantially higher return compared to the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.  The provided Alpha values of 0.0 suggest that the outperformance is not attributable to factors outside of market movements (beta).  However, the context of the Alpha and Beta calculations is missing, making a definitive conclusion impossible.  Further information about the calculation period and methodology is needed.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $255.27
* **Last Market Price:** $258.20
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $252.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $245.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $233.89

The stock price is currently above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The difference between the last market price and the closing price indicates minor price fluctuations.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.87 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.1985 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** 0.0 (-) - Short-term downward movement.  This contrasts with the general upward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 203.2% (Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 projected).  The context for this expected return is needed for a meaningful interpretation. The reliability of this estimate needs to be assessed before acting on it.  The provided statement lacks crucial detail for evaluation.

The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, potentially indicating a short-term correction. However, the positive PPO and the overall strong upward trend could continue. The 20-day relative divergence showing a slight downward trend suggests caution, despite the larger upward trend.  The high expected return is notable but requires additional context and justification.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, showing substantial cumulative returns.  However, recent earnings data reveals substantial revenue and EPS volatility.

Filling these gaps would significantly improve the quality of this analysis and lead to more actionable insights.  The high RSI cautions against assuming continued immediate outperformance.  Before making any investment decisions, complete information on all relevant aspects of AAPL's performance is needed.
