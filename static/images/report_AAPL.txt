2025-01-26 - Analysis Report
## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 319.89%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 122.16%.  The difference is 197.7%, placing it at the 75th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates AAPL has generally outperformed VOO over the measured period, but the provided data doesn't show the timeframe of this outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows consistently high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) for AAPL across several years, ranging from 35% to 299%, with Alpha consistently at 0. This suggests that the stock's outperformance is primarily due to systematic market factors (high Beta), rather than manager skill.  Note that a zero Alpha is likely due to the limitations of the model. A more robust analysis is needed to confirm this.  The Beta values are missing from the table, hindering a complete assessment of market sensitivity.  Market capitalization has also increased significantly over the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $222.78
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $224.58
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $239.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $237.06

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend. The recent price change shows a slight decrease (-0.39%).

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (23.88):** Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce.
* **PPO (-1.02):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-5.5%):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (83.5%):**  This suggests a high potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), assuming continued long-term investment.  However, this estimate requires further validation. The information provided doesn't specify the methodology used to calculate this expected return, which is crucial for assessing its reliability.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. There appears to be a duplication of data for 2024-08-02.  A more thorough analysis would require a cleaner dataset and more contextual information.  There are missing quarters, and seasonal effects need to be considered before making any robust conclusions.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue fluctuates between quarters but generally remains high.  Profit margins are consistently strong, ranging from 45% to 46%. This shows a healthy financial condition.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has fluctuated in the given period.  ROE is high, indicating strong profitability relative to shareholder equity. However, there is significant quarter-to-quarter variation. Further analysis is needed to identify the causes of this variation, as this volatility could be a sign of potential risk.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, evidenced by its significantly higher cumulative returns and high CAGR. However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downtrend. While the RSI indicates oversold conditions, the negative PPO and declining relative strength suggest bearish momentum in the near term.  The high expected return (if accurately calculated) points towards a positive outlook for long-term investors. Nevertheless, the provided data contains inconsistencies and omissions requiring further clarification and investigation.  A complete analysis necessitates a broader dataset covering a longer period and a deeper dive into the factors driving the quarterly fluctuations in financial metrics.  The quality of the data provided limits the confidence of the analysis.
