The difference in cumulative returns is 268.2 percentage points (397.93% - 129.75%). The high relative outperformance (96.9%) indicates AAPL's performance consistently sits at the higher end of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

* **PPO (0.69):**  A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (NaN):**  Missing data prevents analysis of recent relative divergence.  
* **Expected Return (229.7%):**  The expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is substantial.  However, this is a forecast and not a guaranteed return.  The current price near $242.63, being above the moving averages, doesnâ€™t necessarily suggest an immediate correction, but the extremely high RSI value warrants caution.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, with consistently positive alpha. However, the extremely high RSI (85.31) indicates an overbought condition, potentially suggesting a short-term correction is likely. The recent earnings data shows some volatility in both revenue and EPS, warranting further investigation into the underlying causes. While long-term prospects appear positive based on the high expected return, the overbought condition suggests caution in the short term. The absence of recent news and market outlook data limits the completeness of the overall analysis.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the overbought condition and the volatility in recent earnings, a cautious approach is advised.  While the long-term outlook remains positive, consider the risk of short-term price correction. Further investigation into the causes of recent EPS and revenue fluctuations is crucial. Additional information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions would significantly enhance this analysis. The high projected return should be considered cautiously alongside the high RSI value which suggests the high valuation may not be sustainable in the short term.
