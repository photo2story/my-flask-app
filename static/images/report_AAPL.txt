**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Summary:** Apple has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, and continues to show high growth potential.

Recent news is largely positive, with analysts generally maintaining a "Buy" rating. However, the recent layoff news warrants consideration. The financial data demonstrates consistent profitability and improving equity.
*   **Investment Recommendation:** Based on the "Buy" analyst consensus, the high expected return (90.7%), and the "Buy" Hybrid Signal, a long-term investment in Apple appears attractive, provided you are comfortable with medium risk. It might be prudent to monitor the impact of the layoffs. The current price is around the average target set by analysts.
