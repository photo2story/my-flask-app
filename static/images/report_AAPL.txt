2025-01-15 - Analysis Report
## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company that designs, develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services.

The cumulative return for AAPL is 339.68%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.74%. The difference in cumulative returns is 226.9%.  The relative divergence of 85% indicates that AAPL's performance is in the upper 85th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests historically strong outperformance.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for AAPL across various periods, ranging from 35% to 214%.  The Beta is consistently 0.0, which is unlikely and suggests a problem with the data provided.  A beta of 0 implies no correlation with the market, which is unrealistic for a major stock like AAPL.  Further investigation into the data source is required to understand this discrepancy.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) fluctuates, indicating periods of significant market corrections impacting AAPL. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth over the years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $233.28
* **5-day Moving Average:** $237.89
* **20-day Moving Average:** $247.87
* **60-day Moving Average:** $237.75

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 19.29 - This indicates the stock is oversold, potentially suggesting a bounce back, but it's crucial to consider this within the broader context.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.13 -  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.9% - Shows a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 63.3% - This represents an expected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) assuming current conditions continue.  However, this should be treated with caution; long-term projections are inherently uncertain.  The provided value would be significantly higher than historical returns.
The closing price of $233.28 is below the moving averages, supporting the interpretation of a downward trend.  A sudden jump would be a significant anomaly.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicates (two entries for 2024-08-02). The trend appears to be downward over the past few quarters from a peak in Q1 2024.  Further analysis with corrected data is needed.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

Revenue shows some volatility, peaking in Q4 2023. Profit margins are consistently high (around 46%), showing strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:**

Equity and Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuate. The ROE is high, reflecting a good return on investment.  However, the data should be scrutinized for inconsistencies.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downward trend.  While long-term projections indicate substantial outperformance, this is highly speculative.  The provided data contains inconsistencies (particularly regarding the Beta and duplicate earnings data) requiring clarification and correction before drawing definitive conclusions.  The high RSI and PPO values suggest caution.  Thorough examination of the data sources and a review of the assumptions of the expected return calculation is crucial.
