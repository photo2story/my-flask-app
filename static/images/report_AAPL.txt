## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return for AAPL is 347.81%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 121.09%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 226.7 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 84.9% indicates AAPL's performance is substantially higher than the S&P 500 historically,  considering the range of historical divergences.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows consistent high growth, particularly between 2017-2020 and 2019-2021. However, Alpha consistently remains at 0.0, indicating the excess returns are not attributed to factors beyond market movements, while the high Beta suggests that the stock's performance is strongly correlated with overall market trends.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $237.59
* **5-day Moving Average:** $233.57
* **20-day Moving Average:** $235.31
* **60-day Moving Average:** $237.44

The price is slightly below the 60-day moving average and above the 20-day and 5-day moving averages, suggesting a slight bearish trend in the short-term, though within a range-bound environment.  The recent decrease of $-0.74 from the previous close indicates a small negative short-term movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.20 – This suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory, but not significantly so.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.31 – A positive value indicates upward momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +9.6 –  Indicates a short-term upward trend.

The recent price change reflects a minor downward correction.  Given the positive PPO and upward relative divergence, this may be a temporary dip within a longer-term upward trend. The expected return of 63.6% over the long-term (2+ years) significantly exceeds the S&P 500, suggesting potential for outperformance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue. While there's a general upward trend in revenue, EPS has seen some fluctuation, notably a significant increase in Q1 2024 ($2.19 EPS), followed by decreases in subsequent quarters. This could potentially warrant further investigation into the underlying factors contributing to this variance.  The duplicate entry for 2024-08-02 should be clarified.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some variability but generally remains strong. Profit margins are consistently high, hovering around 46%, indicating strong profitability.  The significant drop in revenue in Q3 2024 should be explored.


**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity fluctuates, and Return on Equity (ROE) is relatively high. However, there's a significant drop in ROE between Q1 2024 and Q2 2024.  This needs further investigation to understand the contributing factors.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has historically shown significantly stronger performance than the S&P 500. While recent short-term price action shows a minor downward trend, technical indicators suggest potential for further growth.  High profitability and strong revenue (with some quarter-to-quarter variations) support a positive outlook. However, the fluctuating EPS and ROE warrant closer examination to identify the underlying drivers and assess potential risks.  The expected return significantly exceeds the market, implying a positive long-term outlook for the stock, if the current trends prevail.   More in-depth analysis, including future projections and consideration of macroeconomic factors, would be beneficial for a comprehensive assessment.
