## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL (341.04%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 224.6%, placing it at the 84.2nd percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500 based on the provided data's range.  This indicates AAPL's substantial outperformance over the given period.  The alpha of 225% further highlights this significant outperformance.  A beta of 0.0 suggests minimal correlation with the overall market movement.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

| Metric             | Value      |
|----------------------|------------|
| Closing Price       | $234.00    |
| Last Market Price   | $231.95    |
| 5-Day Moving Average | $235.28    |
| 20-Day Moving Average| $246.50    |
| 60-Day Moving Average| $237.84    |

The current price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (19.19):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound.
* **PPO (-0.947):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -6.0% signifies a recent weakening in relative strength.

The provided last market price of $231.95 does not indicate a significant sudden price movement (neither a sharp rebound nor a sharp drop) based on the given context and the relatively small price difference from the closing price.

The expected return of 64.7% over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, exceeding the S&P 500, reflects a bullish outlook.  This prediction should be treated with caution, as it's highly dependent on various market factors.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.

However, inconsistencies in the provided earnings data and fluctuations in financial metrics require further investigation before drawing definitive conclusions.  The high beta suggests high market sensitivity. The apparently contradictory data regarding some financial aspects may lead to erroneous results and more detailed and corrected data should be provided.
