2024-11-24 - Analysis Report
## Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in consumer electronics, software, and online services.

The cumulative return of AAPL is 374.64%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 127.58%.  The difference is 247.06%, placing it in the 89.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates AAPL has substantially outperformed the market benchmark over the analyzed period. The provided Alpha values consistently above 1 further support this superior performance, indicating AAPL generated returns exceeding those expected based solely on its market beta.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for AAPL across all periods, ranging from 51.4% to 220.2%.  The Alpha values (ranging from 1.1 to 1.4) consistently show that AAPL outperformed the market benchmark, while the Beta (around 1.2 consistently) suggests moderate market sensitivity.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates substantial corrections during certain periods but the subsequent recoveries showcase the stock's resilience.  The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) highlights AAPL's growth.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $229.87
* **5-day Moving Average:** $228.74
* **20-day Moving Average:** $226.84
* **60-day Moving Average:** $226.65

The price is slightly above the 5-day and significantly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 67.65 –  Suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating a potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.2 – A positive value indicates upward momentum, though the value itself is relatively low.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -3.67 – Shows a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.  Indicates short term bearish sentiment.
* **Expected Return:** 35.38% – This represents a significant potential outperformance of the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  This is a projected and not a guaranteed return.  

The closing price of $229.76 is not significantly different from the previous day's closing price making it unlikely that a major immediate market fluctuation caused the result.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue. While the most recent quarter (2024-08-02) shows lower EPS than the preceding quarter,  overall revenue remained relatively stable and strong.  A comparison with analyst expectations for the most recent quarter is crucial to get a full picture of performance, which isn't provided in the data.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Consistent high revenue and profit margin across quarters, demonstrating robust financial health.  Note a slight dip in both during 2024 Q2 followed by a return to a similar level in Q3.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Strong equity position, with a high ROE (Return on Equity) in most quarters.  A notable dip in ROE in 2024 Q2 likely corresponds to the Revenue and Profitability dip.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Data:**  The report lacks crucial information, including specific recent news (especially within the last two days, as requested), analyst opinions from sources like FINBOLD, and a detailed outlook. This prevents a complete evaluation of recent market sentiment and potential catalysts impacting the stock price. To complete this section, I need access to real-time news sources and financial analysis platforms.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AAPL has historically shown strong performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent price action suggests an upward trend, though RSI indicates potential short-term correction.  Consistent high revenue and profitability demonstrate financial strength.  However, the lack of current news, analyst ratings, and comparison to earnings expectations prevents a thorough assessment of near-term prospects. The high expected return suggests long-term potential, but this is contingent on various market and company factors. The provided data alone is insufficient to provide confident advice.  Further information is needed to formulate a more complete investment recommendation.


**8. Next Steps:**

To provide a more comprehensive and accurate analysis, I need the following:

* **Analyst ratings and price targets:** from sources such as FINBOLD and other reputable financial analysis sites.
* **Comparison of actual earnings to expectations:** to assess market reaction to the results.
* **Recent news and events:** including press releases, earnings calls transcripts, and market commentary.
* **Detailed analysis of the 2024-08-02 earnings report**, including any downward revisions or potential issues in supply chain or other market factors.


With these additions, a more robust and detailed investment recommendation can be developed.
