*   **60-day SMA:** 195.45

**Analysis:** The stock is slightly above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, but below its 5-day moving average. This suggests a potential for short-term correction. The small positive change in the most recent trading day indicates limited upward momentum.

*   **Divergence Change:** A short-term increase in relative divergence is a positive sign.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-794.4%) is very concerning and suggests very high risk and potential for significant losses if held long-term. This may be an error or outlier in the calculation.

*   **Recent Trends:**  Recent earnings and revenue figures are positive, and ROE has shown improvement.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Technical indicators are neutral to slightly positive in the short-term. The PPO is slightly negative and the RSI is around the 50 level.
*   **News:** The news is mixed, with some positive announcements offset by concerns about a lowered profit outlook and stock sales.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:**  Analysts are generally positive with a "Buy" rating, but the low end of the target price range is at the current stock price.

*   **Financial Health:** Revenue growth and strong profitability margins.

**Overall Conclusion:**

While Honeywell exhibits some positive financial trends (revenue and profitability) and receives a "Buy" rating from analysts, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative Alpha, and concerning news regarding profit outlook and stock sales, warrant caution. The extremely low expected return should be investigated to verify accuracy. The short term indicators are neutral and suggest the stock might slightly be on the rise but this needs to be verified with real time data.
