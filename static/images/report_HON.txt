* **20-day Moving Average:** $200.84

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HON's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500.  While the company shows strong financial fundamentals with high profit margins and ROE, the recent price action suggests a bearish short-term trend. However, the RSI suggests potential for a short-term rebound. The relatively low beta suggests lower volatility than the market.  The positive long-term expected return and relatively stable revenue make it a potentially attractive long-term investment for risk-tolerant investors comfortable with the underperformance relative to the market.  Further investigation into the causes of EPS variability and the duplicate entry in the earnings data is recommended.  A thorough review of the company's strategic direction and industry outlook is also crucial for a complete assessment.
