The consistently high CAGR, even in the face of these negative alphas in some years, indicates consistently strong revenue generation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HON shows a mixed picture.  While it boasts high revenue and generally strong profit margins, its recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 considerably. Technical indicators suggest the stock may be oversold, but the negative expected return and high maximum drawdowns raise concerns.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the negative alpha and the significantly lower projected long-term return compared to the S&P 500 is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The -124.2% expected return is a particularly alarming figure and requires further investigation to verify its accuracy and underlying assumptions.  Consider reviewing HON's future earnings reports and conducting a more thorough fundamental analysis before considering an investment.  The volatility of both EPS and revenue also warrants closer examination to assess the sustainability of their current performance levels.
