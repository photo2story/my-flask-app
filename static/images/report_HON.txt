However, the recent negative CAGRs and significantly increasing Max Drawdowns (MDD) indicate potential challenges. The Beta, generally around 0.5-0.7, suggests moderate market sensitivity.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $208.25

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price increase (2.13) might indicate a temporary bounce, but more data is needed to confirm a trend reversal.

The recent price change of 2.13 suggests a potential short-term bounce after a period of decline.  However, the overall technical picture is mixed, requiring further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HON has shown a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 recently, despite historically positive alpha.  While the financials appear strong (healthy profit margins and increasing equity), the recent negative CAGR and high MDD are concerning. The technical indicators are mixed, with the price below key moving averages but showing some short-term upward momentum.  The relatively low RSI suggests potential for further recovery, but caution is warranted due to the overall negative trend. A more detailed investigation into the reasons behind the recent underperformance and a thorough risk assessment are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided expected return of 1.3% should be considered with caution, given the recent volatility and the need for more comprehensive analysis. The duplicate data entry in the earnings report also needs to be addressed.
