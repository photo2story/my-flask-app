**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Honeywell's cumulative return (72.04%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (118.39%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -46.4%, placing it at the 16.1st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  This indicates HON's underperformance relative to the broader market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **20-day Moving Average:** $228.97
* **60-day Moving Average:** $221.65

The stock price is trading slightly above its short-term moving averages, suggesting a relatively stable recent trend.  However, the 60-day average indicates a modest upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.61 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.17 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** -2.4% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -69.6% (This suggests a significant underperformance expectation relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon of 2+ years.  This should be viewed cautiously; the reliability of long-term projected return is questionable and should not be taken as definitive.  Contextual factors not included here could significantly affect future performance.)

The substantial negative expected return highlights the significant underperformance against the S&P 500, warranting further investigation.
