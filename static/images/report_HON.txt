The analysis shows varying CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different periods. Alpha is generally positive, suggesting outperformance relative to the benchmark (although the last two years show negative alphas).  Beta is relatively stable, hovering around 0.5-0.7, indicating moderate sensitivity to market movements.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $193.28
* **Previous Close:** $198.81
* **Change:** -$2.78 (a significant drop)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $196.86
* **20-day Moving Average:** $203.76
* **60-day Moving Average:** $209.55

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent significant price drop warrants further investigation into potential underlying factors.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4118 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.68 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.2993 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +2.5% (Short-term upward trend, but needs to be considered in context of overall downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 2.5% (This is a very optimistic estimate given the current negative trends and needs better justification and a more robust model)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum. The recent price drop of $2.78 warrants further investigation.  The 2.5% expected return is questionable without a detailed explanation of the methodology used to derive this figure and it is especially doubtful given current market conditions reflected by the moving averages.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 2.17 | $9.73B        |
| 2024-07-25 | 2.37 | $9.58B        |

| 2023-10-26 | 2.29 | $9.21B        |
| 2024-10-24 | 2.29 | $9.21B        | *(Duplicate Entry)*


Earnings show some fluctuation, with a slight downward trend in recent quarters.  The duplicate entry for October 24, 2024 needs clarification. Further analysis requires more historical data and a comparison with analyst expectations.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

HON's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, although its underperformance is within the range of its historical fluctuations.  Recent price action shows a bearish trend, supported by technical indicators (RSI, PPO). While the financial statements show a relatively healthy financial position, earnings show some recent weakness.  The provided 2.5% long-term expected return is highly suspect and needs substantial justification.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and a more detailed analysis of earnings and market conditions are needed before making any investment decisions.  Consideration should be given to the relatively high beta, indicating sensitivity to market downturns.
