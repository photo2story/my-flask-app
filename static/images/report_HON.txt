2025-12-23 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Honeywell International Inc. (HON) based on the provided data, broken down into sections for clarity.

**1) Return Rate Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Honeywell International Inc. is a diversified technology and manufacturing company serving customers worldwide with aerospace products, building and industrial control technologies, and performance materials.
*   **Cumulative Return:**
    *   HON: 9.39%
    *   VOO (S&P 500): 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -91.5 (Relative Divergence: 4.8)
*   **Analysis:** HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. The large negative divergence indicates a considerable gap in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 4.8 suggests that, compared to its historical range of divergence with the S&P 500, the current underperformance is near the lower end of the historical range. This means that while significant, the underperformance isn't unprecedented.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD  | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|------|---------|--------|--------|

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR has declined significantly in recent periods, reflecting weaker performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD figures indicate significant volatility and potential for substantial losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha has been mostly negative in recent years, indicating HON has underperformed its benchmark. The particularly large negative Alpha in the 2023-2025 period is concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta has been increasing, suggesting that HON's price is becoming more sensitive to market movements (S&P 500). A beta of 2.0 for 2023-2025 indicates a high degree of market-related risk, with the stock being twice as volatile as the market.
*   **Cap (B):** Market capitalization fluctuates, providing a general scale for the company, but it's important to correlate the change in capitalization against revenue and profit trends.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 199.11
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 195.96
    *   Previous Close: 199.11
    *   Change: -1.58
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 198.56
    *   20-day SMA: 193.45
    *   60-day SMA: 200.20
*   **Analysis:** The current price is below the 60-day SMA, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, indicating a possible short-term positive momentum, but further confirmation is needed. The last market data indicates a slight recent price decrease.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 65.41 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.67
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 2.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -625.4%
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI indicates a medium investment recommendation.
    *   The RSI value suggests the stock is approaching overbought conditions, which could precede a price correction.
    *   The Hybrid Signal is recommending a full investment, which is slightly contradictory to the negative expected return and recent news.
    *   The PPO is positive, but very small.
    *   The recent positive divergence change suggests a short-term upward trend.
    *   The *extremely* negative expected return is highly concerning and likely indicative of a significant problem identified by the analysis algorithm which generated this number, or an anomaly. It strongly suggests *avoiding* a long-term investment at this time.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes:** The recent news is predominantly negative, focusing on a potential large settlement related to Flexjet, portfolio reshaping, and underperformance compared to competitors.
*   **Specifically:**
    *   The $470M settlement is a significant financial burden.
    *   Mentions of business spin-offs imply restructuring and potential uncertainty.
    *   Comparisons with 3M suggest HON may not be the strongest pick in the industrial sector.
*   **Impact:** This negative news flow is likely contributing to the stock's recent underperformance.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:**
    *   Rating: Buy (Mean: 2.07)
    *   Opinions: 24
    *   Target Price: $237.40 (Avg)
*   **Analysis:**  Despite the recent challenges, the analyst consensus remains a "Buy" with a significant upside potential based on the average target price. However, the lack of information on recent rating changes is a limitation.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Honeywell faces a mixed outlook. While recent earnings and revenue figures are positive, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Negative news related to a potential legal settlement and business restructuring weighs on investor sentiment. Technical indicators suggest the stock is approaching overbought territory. The high and increasing Beta indicates greater volatility relative to the market, which is undesirable in the current context. The extremely negative "Expected Return" figure is a major red flag. While analysts maintain a "Buy" rating, the overall picture suggests caution.

**Recommendation:**

Due to the substantial underperformance, negative news flow, very negative expected return, increasing Beta, and potential overbought conditions, a conservative approach is warranted. While analysts may see long-term potential, the immediate outlook appears challenging. *Waiting for more positive signals and clarification on the settlement and restructuring is recommended before considering a long-term investment*. The positive earnings revisions are a potentially positive sign. Watch for upcoming quarterly reports. If those turn negative, that will further reduce confidence in the stock.
