* **20-day Moving Average:** $208.72
* **60-day Moving Average:** $218.50

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting some short-term momentum but potential resistance around the 60-day average.  The recent price increase of $1.54 reflects a short-term positive trend.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |

| 2024-10-24 | 2.29  | $9.21B        |
