| 2023-2025  | -25.0% | 79.7% | -90.0% | 2.0 | 130.2 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR has decreased significantly in recent periods, even showing negative growth in the last few years.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD has remained high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha has been significantly negative in recent years, meaning Honeywell has been underperforming its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis. The last row is especially concerning at -90.0%.
*   **Beta:** The Beta has been consistently above 1, indicating that Honeywell's price is more volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B) Market Cap:** While the market cap initially increased, it has decreased again recently.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 193.215
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 193.22, Previous Close: 190.22, Change: 1.58
*   **5-day SMA:** 191.015
*   **20-day SMA:** 194.5458
*   **60-day SMA:** 204.0694

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The 5-day SMA is close to the current price indicating that the stock has slightly rebounded recently.  The last market data shows a positive change, indicating an upward move on the last trading day, but the magnitude of the recent rebound is unclear without historical context.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.05
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.07
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.7 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3100.1 (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" which may be misleading given the other indicators.  It is important to note that MRI is not a universally accepted indicator and its reliability is questionable.
*   The RSI of 45.05 indicates a neutral condition, not overbought or oversold.
*   The PPO of 0.07 indicates that the 12-day moving average is slightly above the 26-day moving average, hinting at a weak bullish signal.
*   The hybrid signal is suggesting aggressive buying but contradicts the other data. The "Very Safe" characterization is questionable given the negative expected return and the underperformance against the S&P 500.
*   The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days confirms a short-term decline.
*   The extremely negative expected return of -3100.1% is a major red flag. This suggests that the model anticipates significant further underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if invested long-term.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Several articles highlight negative analyst opinions (downgrades from Barron's, reduced price target from TD Cowen).  The CNBC article argues against the double downgrade, but the fact that it happened is itself noteworthy.
*   **Positive News:** The DailyForex article discusses whether it's time to go long, and the Insider Monkey article mentions Honeywell supporting expansion at Dangote Refinery, suggesting potential future growth.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The Forbes article asks whether the stock is a "Smart Buy Or Caution Ahead?", indicating uncertainty.

**Analysis:** The news flow is mixed, but the presence of several negative headlines concerning downgrades and price target reductions is a cause for concern. The positive news about the Dangote Refinery is potentially a long-term positive, but the immediate sentiment seems bearish.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.00)
*   **Opinions:** 20 analysts
*   **Target Price:** Average: 241.67, High: 271.00, Low: 205.00

**Analysis:**  Despite the recent negative news and stock performance, the analyst consensus remains a "Buy" with a significant average target price above the current price.  This suggests analysts believe the stock is undervalued and has the potential for future growth. However, the recent rating changes (which are not provided) would be important to consider in determining if the consensus is shifting. The wide range between the high and low target prices (271 vs 205) indicates significant uncertainty in the outlook.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출          |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-10-23 | 2.87 | 10.41 B$      |
| 2025-07-24 | 2.46 | 10.35 B$      |

| 2025-10-23 | 2.17 | 9.73 B$       |

**Analysis:** Earnings per share (EPS) and revenue have been generally increasing over the reported quarters, particularly with a spike in the most recent quarter (2025-10-23). This could be a positive sign, but needs to be interpreted in light of the previously discussed concerns. Note there is a duplicate record of 2025-10-23 which should be reconciled.

| 2024-09-30 | $17.41B | 8.12% |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profit Margin:** Revenue shows a general increase in the last few quarters. Profit margins are relatively high, but fluctuate. The most recent quarter saw a revenue high but a dip in profit margin.
*   **Equity & ROE (Return on Equity):** Equity has been decreasing overall. ROE has increased recently, coinciding with the increase in EPS and revenue, but it remains volatile.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Honeywell presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Signals:** It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a very large negative divergence. Its Alpha has been poor in recent years. The technical indicators and the recent change in relative divergence suggest a short-term downtrend. Several recent news articles highlight analyst downgrades. The expected return is shockingly negative (-3100.1%). Equity has been decreasing overall.
*   **Positive Signals:** Recent earnings (EPS and revenue) have shown positive growth. Analyst consensus remains a "Buy" with a target price considerably above the current level, indicating a belief in future growth. The MRI indicator misleadingly suggests a high investment recommendation, and the DailyForex article offers a contrasting view of possible rebound.
*   **Neutral Signals:** The RSI is neutral. PPO is weakly bullish.
*   **Overall Assessment:** While analysts are still optimistic and recent earnings are encouraging, the overwhelming evidence suggests caution. The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the negative alpha, the short-term downtrend, the negative news flow, and the alarmingly negative expected return are all red flags.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this data, a cautious approach is warranted. While the analyst consensus is positive, the negative signals are strong enough to suggest that a "Buy" recommendation may be premature. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and the drastically negative expected return. Before investing, consider:

*   **Understanding the divergence:** Why has Honeywell lagged the S&P 500 so significantly? Is it industry-specific, company-specific, or a broader market trend?
*   **Investigating the negative expected return:** What is driving this incredibly negative projection? What assumptions are being used?
*   **Monitoring analyst rating changes:** Are analysts revising their ratings downward in light of recent performance and news?
*   **Analyzing management's strategy:** What are Honeywell's plans to improve performance and address the challenges it faces?

In summary, while there are some potentially positive signs, the current data raises significant concerns about Honeywell's performance and future prospects. Prudence dictates a cautious approach and further research before making any investment decisions.
