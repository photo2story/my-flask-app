* **5-day Moving Average:** $197.45
* **20-day Moving Average:** $200.22

* **PPO:** 0.27 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -5.0% (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.9% (This represents expected S&P 500 outperformance over the long term.  This value should be viewed with caution as it is a single point estimate and not an investment guarantee.)  The recent price increase should be considered; however, the small increase does not significantly alter the overall medium-risk assessment.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Honeywell (HON) has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in recent times, despite a generally positive historical alpha.  While financial statements indicate a relatively healthy financial position with stable profit margins and increasing revenue, recent earnings show some volatility, and the stock price is trending downwards, sitting below its 60-day moving average.  The medium-risk assessment from the MRI, combined with a relatively low RSI and recent negative relative strength change, suggests a cautious outlook in the short term.  The projected long-term outperformance (0.9%) should be interpreted carefully.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance, including a review of industry trends and company-specific factors, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data needs to be addressed.
