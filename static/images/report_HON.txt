## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Honeywell International Inc. (HON), a diversified technology and manufacturing company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Honeywell's cumulative return (63.85%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (112.20%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -48.3%, placing it at the 13.8th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (a range of -59.9% to 24.4%).  This indicates HON's underperformance compared to the broader market.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $218.19
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $221.45
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $226.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $223.03

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 31.18 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.63 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.7 – This reinforces the short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -86.4% – This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and warrants further investigation into the underlying assumptions of this projection.  A return of this magnitude is highly improbable, and the projection may be inaccurate.

The current price of $218.19, given the other indicators, doesn't necessarily suggest a sharp rebound or decline.  However, the combination of low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the price being below its moving averages, warrants caution.

**7. Overall Summary:**

Honeywell's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While the company shows relatively stable revenue and strong profit margins, the projected long-term underperformance relative to the market (-86.4%) is deeply concerning and likely inaccurate.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, but the negative PPO and downward trend warrant caution.  Further investigation into the data errors, particularly the duplicate entry in the earnings data, and the methodology behind the -86.4% expected return projection is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current data alone does not provide a clear buy or sell signal; more thorough due diligence is required.
