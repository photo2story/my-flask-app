2025-01-15 - Analysis Report
Here's an analysis of Honeywell International Inc. (HON) based on the provided data, formatted as a report.

**1. Performance Comparison and Overview**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), HON's cumulative return lags significantly.  While VOO shows a cumulative return of 112.74%, HON's cumulative return is 64.08%. This results in a difference of -48.7%, placing it at the 13.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided min/max range.  This indicates HON underperformed the market significantly during the analyzed period.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows fluctuating performance over different periods, ranging from a high of 41% to a low of -3%.  The alpha consistently remains around 0.4, suggesting a slight outperformance compared to the benchmark after accounting for beta (market risk). However, the negative CAGR in 2021-2023 and the relatively low CAGR in 2023-2025  highlights recent underperformance.  The beta, while relatively high, indicates sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement**

As of the provided data, HON closed at $218.50.  The stock price is currently below its 5-day ($219.32), 20-day ($225.95), and 60-day ($223.09) moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  This reinforces the underperformance noted in the previous section.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

The RSI of 28.73 indicates that HON is currently in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible.  However, the negative PPO (-0.57) suggests bearish momentum.  The recent increase in the relative strength index (+2.9) over 20 days is a positive sign but needs more context.  The provided expected return of -91% is extremely negative and likely indicates a significant downside risk.  This significantly contradicts the alpha provided earlier, and further investigation is required to resolve this discrepancy.  The value of 218.50 does not appear to signify a major uptrend or downtrend given the broader context, but the context is crucial in considering whether the RSI and PPO indicators warrant a long position.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis**

The recent earnings data show some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's no clear upward or downward trend discernable from this limited data.  Further analysis, including a comparison with analyst expectations, would be necessary to draw meaningful conclusions.  Note the duplicate entry for 2024-10-24. This should be checked for accuracy.

**5. Financial Information**

The financial data shows relatively stable revenue around $9.5 billion. Profit margins have been consistently high (34-39%), suggesting strong profitability. Equity has also shown growth, and ROE remains reasonably healthy, although it fluctuates.  A more in-depth analysis is needed, including comparison with industry benchmarks, to comprehensively assess the financial health.

| 2024-09-30 | 9.73         | 38.54%        | 17.41       | 8.12    |
| 2024-06-30 | 9.58         | 38.85%        | 16.95       | 9.11    |

| 2023-12-31 | 9.44         | 34.31%        | 15.86       | 7.97    |

**7.  Overall Analysis**

HON's recent performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While the company shows consistent profitability and healthy financial ratios, the recent price action and negative expected return raise concerns. The discrepancy between the alpha and the predicted return highlights the need for more thorough research.  The oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the negative PPO and the overall underperformance relative to the market indicate caution.  More data and a deeper dive into the fundamentals, including a comparison to industry peers and future earnings expectations, are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The -91% expected return is highly suspect and warrants investigation into its source and calculation methodology.
