## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  Its cumulative return of 70.06% significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) return of 114.36% over the measured period.  The difference is -44.3%, placing it in the 18.4th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided minimum and maximum divergences).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $226.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $230.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $228.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $219.40

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a slightly bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 46.52 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.18 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +7.2% (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates no expected alpha over the S&P 500 based on the given data.  Long-term outperformance is not guaranteed.)

The current price of $226.86, slightly below recent moving averages, doesn't indicate a significant immediate price surge or crash.  The low expected return and negative PPO suggest caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally remained stable around $9.5B, with some slight fluctuations. There is no clear upward or downward trend.
* **EPS:** EPS has also fluctuated, ranging from $2.17 to $2.37.  There is no strong consistent trend apparent from the given data.  Comparing the Oct 24th data points might indicate an error in data input.  Further investigation into these potentially duplicated entries is necessary.

Without access to expected EPS and revenue figures, it's impossible to determine whether earnings "beat" or "missed" expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows relative stability. Profit margins are consistently high (around 38%), though there was a dip to 34.31% in Q4 2023.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally increased, while ROE fluctuates but generally remains above 8%.  There appears to be some quarter-to-quarter variance that requires further scrutiny to identify potential causes.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent earnings news (within the last two days) is provided.  Market outlook and analyst opinions are missing.  This information is crucial for a comprehensive investment analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

HON's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly in the measured period.  While the company shows generally strong financial health (high profit margins and reasonable ROE), the recent price action and technical indicators suggest a relatively bearish short-term outlook.  The lack of recent news and analyst sentiment makes a definitive judgment difficult.  The provided data lacks sufficient context to give a robust investment recommendation.  Further analysis is necessary, particularly regarding the duplicated Oct 24th data point in the earnings report and the missing market outlook and analyst opinions.  A long-term investment strategy, potentially using dollar-cost averaging, might mitigate some risks given the lack of strong directional guidance currently available.
