*   **Analysis:** HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period covered by the cumulative return data. The relative divergence being at 0% suggests this underperformance is near its historical worst (compared to VOO). The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance.  While some periods show strong Alpha generation, recent years (2021-2025) show negative Alpha, indicating underperformance relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark. The increasing Beta over time suggests HON is becoming more correlated with the market.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** $214.25
*   **Last Market Price:** $214.75 (change: +0.23)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** $215.41
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $217.89
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $225.39

*   **Analysis:** The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The small positive change in the last market price doesn't drastically alter this overall bearish signal from the moving averages. The recent price action suggests continued downside momentum.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 44.22 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.0786 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.6 (Short-term decline in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return:** -610.5% (Significant underperformance vs. S&P 500 over long-term)

*   **Analysis:** The MRI indicates a low-risk environment, but the negative PPO and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence, combined with the low RSI, point to continued short-term underperformance. The very low expected return suggests a significant level of pessimism regarding HON's future relative performance. The Hybrid signal suggests a buy rating but also highlights caution due to the MRI.

*   **Analysis:** Revenue and EPS have generally been increasing. Profit margins are consistently high. However, Equity has been decreasing, and ROE has fluctuated. The recent decrease in equity could be related to the Solstice spin-off.

**7. Overall Assessment:**

Honeywell presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Factors:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative momentum indicators (PPO, Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence), concerning expected return, and declining Equity. The recent Solstice spin-off adds uncertainty.
*   **Positive Factors:** Low Market Risk Indicator, strong analyst consensus with upside potential, leading position in the physical security industry, and generally positive earnings trends.
*   **Conclusion:**  While analysts are optimistic, the data suggests caution.  The underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern. Investors should carefully consider the potential impact of the Solstice spin-off and the reasons behind the declining Equity before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the causes of the underperformance is warranted.
