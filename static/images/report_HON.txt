**Analysis:** The news headlines paint a mixed but concerning picture.  The articles comparing Honeywell to 3M suggest uncertainty about Honeywell's relative performance. The double downgrade and the article questioning the bull case are clear warning signs.  The acquisition by Marshall Wace warrants further investigation.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 2.04 (~Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 21
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 239.40 / 271.00 / 195.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is currently "Buy", despite the negative news and performance indicators. This creates a *divergence* between analyst sentiment and the quantitative data. The average target price of $239.40 suggests significant upside potential *if* the analysts' expectations are met.
