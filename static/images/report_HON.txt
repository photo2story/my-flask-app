**1) Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  Its cumulative return of 69.59% significantly lags the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 121.38%.  The divergence is -51.6%, representing a 9.7% deviation from the minimum observed divergence (-59.8%).

**2) Recent Stock Price:**

The closing price is $226.38 (Last market price: $225.14).

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility but generally positive trends.

* **Latest Quarterly Results Comparison:**  The most recent quarter (ending 2024-10-24) shows a slight decrease in both EPS (from $2.37 to $2.17) and revenue ($9.73B vs $9.58B) compared to the previous quarter (2024-07-25).  However, both EPS and revenue remain above levels seen earlier in 2024 and 2023.  There's a discrepancy in the table showing two entries for 2024-10-24; this needs clarification.

* **Revenue Growth Trends:** Revenue fluctuates between $9.11B and $9.73B over the provided timeframe, indicating relatively stable revenue, with some minor quarterly fluctuations.  No clear upward or downward trend is evident from this limited data.

* **EPS Trends and Significant Changes:**  EPS shows some fluctuation but no clear sustained trend.  The significant decrease from $2.37 to $2.17 in the most recent quarter is notable.  Without knowing expected EPS, we cannot assess whether this constitutes a "beat" or "miss".  Again, the duplicated 2024-10-24 data needs clarification.

* **Beats or Misses:** Cannot be determined without expected EPS values.


**5) Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

Revenue remains relatively stable around $9.5B, with minor fluctuations. Profit margins are generally strong, hovering around 38%, except for a dip to 34.31% in Q4 2023. This dip needs further investigation to understand the underlying causes.

**Capital and Profitability:**

Equity shows a general upward trend, reflecting growth in the company's net worth. Return on Equity (ROE) is also relatively stable, ranging from 7.97% to 9.11%, indicating consistent profitability relative to shareholder equity.  A noticeable dip in equity and ROE is observed between Q1 2024 and Q2 2024. Further analysis is required to ascertain the reason for this.

**6) News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last 2 days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.

**7) Overall Analysis:**

Honeywell's performance shows a mixed picture.  While the company demonstrates consistent revenue and strong profit margins, its stock price underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is a concern. The recent decline in EPS and the inconsistencies in the provided earnings data require further investigation.  A deeper analysis incorporating missing data (expected EPS, market outlook, and analyst opinions) is needed for a comprehensive evaluation. The seemingly duplicated data point for 2024-10-24 requires clarification.  Addressing the data discrepancies and incorporating missing context from point 6 will give a more accurate assessment of HONâ€™s current standing and future outlook.
