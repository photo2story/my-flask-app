**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuating performance over different periods, with negative growth in recent years (2021-2025).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD values indicate significant potential losses during these periods. Consistently high, suggesting volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Recent periods show negative alpha, meaning HON has underperformed relative to its benchmark (risk-adjusted). The 2023-2025 period is particularly concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally above 1, indicating the stock is more volatile than the market. The 2023-2025 period shows a Beta of 2.0, suggesting very high market sensitivity.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization remains substantial, but consistent growth is not guaranteed based on the negative CAGR of the last few years.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** $209.05
*   **Previous Close:** $211.01
*   **Price Change:** -$0.93
*   **5-day Moving Average:** $209.96
*   **20-day Moving Average:** $210.69
*   **60-day Moving Average:** $218.99

**Analysis:** The price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60 days), indicating a short-term downtrend. The recent price drop (negative change) and position below moving averages suggest continued bearish momentum.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 38.72 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet there)
*   **PPO:** 0.19 (Positive, suggesting the short-term moving average is above the long-term average, but the value is small.)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Difference Change:** -0.8 (Negative, indicating short-term decline relative to the benchmark)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2512.9 (Extremely negative, suggesting significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.)

**Analysis:** The MRI is high, suggesting a generally favorable market environment. However, the RSI is relatively low, hinting at potential short-term overselling. The extremely negative expected return is very concerning and contradicts the MRI, suggesting Honeywell-specific challenges. The recent price change of -0.93 further contributes to the downward trend. The Hybrid Signal suggests a "Buy" strategy despite these negative signals, possibly due to the high MRI or other factors in the model.

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, indicated by a large negative return difference and negative alpha in recent years. The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. The stock is currently trading below its moving averages, indicating a downtrend. Beta is generally above 1, indicating the stock is more volatile than the market. The 2023-2025 period shows a Beta of 2.0, suggesting very high market sensitivity.
*   **Positives:** Recent earnings show positive trends in EPS and revenue. Analyst consensus is "Buy" with a significant potential upside based on average target prices.

**Conclusion:**

While analyst opinions and some recent news are positive, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the extremely negative expected return raise concerns. The recent downtrend in price action further reinforces this caution. Investors should carefully weigh these risks against the potential upsides before making investment decisions. Consider investigating the reasons behind the underperformance and the reliability of the extremely negative expected return calculation.
