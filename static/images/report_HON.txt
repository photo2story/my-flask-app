| 2023-2025  | -23.0%  | 79.7%   | -91.0%  | 2.0   | 133.0   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate has varied significantly over the periods, showing strong growth in some periods but negative growth more recently. The recent decline is a concern.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, which measures performance relative to a benchmark, has been largely negative in recent periods, especially the most recent year, meaning HON has been underperforming its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta has generally been around 1 or slightly above, suggesting HON's price movements are similar to the market, but with potentially slightly higher volatility in recent years.
*   **Cap:** Market capitalization is volatile and difficult to analyze.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 197.37
*   **Previous Close:** 196.93
*   **Change:** 0.22
*   **5-day SMA:** 196.97
*   **20-day SMA:** 194.75
*   **60-day SMA:** 199.33

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) but below the 60-day SMA. This *could* indicate a short-term upward trend, but a longer-term downtrend needs to be considered.

**3) RSI, PPO and Hybrid Signal Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 64.45
*   **PPO:** 0.31
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 2.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -625.4%

**Analysis:**

*   The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests a "High Investment Recommended" rating, *but* this should be viewed with caution given the other indicators.
*   The RSI of 64.45 is approaching overbought territory (above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.
*   The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is slightly positive, indicating a slight upward trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal is providing a strong buy signal but the extremely negative expected return makes it suspect.
*   The recent divergence change indicates a short-term upward movement, which needs to be evaluated in the context of its recent news and earnings data to understand the reasons behind the change.
*   **Critical:** The Expected Return is *extremely* negative (-625.4%), suggesting significant risks are perceived. This contradicts the MRI.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Holdings Lessened:** Meyer Handelman Co. reduced its holdings in HON.
*   **Stock Sinks:** Honeywell stock sank as the market gained.
*   **HON vs. 3M:** Comparison of HON and 3M in the industrial sector.
*   **Stock Outlook:** "What to Know Before the U.S. Market Opens" type of article (often brief summaries).
*   **Potential Settlement:** Honeywell potentially facing a $470M settlement, which caused a tumble.
*   **Quantum Computing:** Mention of Honeywell in the context of quantum computing as a potential tech play.

**Analysis:**

*   The news is mixed. The reduced holdings and "stock sinks" headlines are negative. The settlement news is particularly concerning as it represents an immediate potential financial liability.
*   The comparison to 3M might provide useful context, but requires further investigation to understand which company is viewed more favorably and why.
*   The quantum computing mention is a potential positive, suggesting future growth opportunities, but is likely a long-term, speculative factor.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.07)
*   **Opinions:** 24
*   **Target Price:** Average: 236.61 / High: 271.00 / Low: 195.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** (No specific changes provided)

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus is generally positive (Buy rating), with an average target price significantly above the current price. This suggests analysts see potential for future growth, but these opinions should be weighed against the other data.

    *   Recent news regarding reduced holdings and a potential settlement are negative.
*   **Positive Signals:**
    *   Recent upward trend in EPS and Revenue.
    *   Strong analyst consensus (Buy rating) and target price.
    *   High MRI (Market Risk Indicator) indicating high investment is recommended.
    *   Significant increase in Return on Equity (ROE) in the most recent quarter.
    *   5-day SMA above the 20-day SMA indicates a short-term uptrend.
*   **Mixed/Neutral Signals:**
    *   The RSI is approaching overbought territory.
    *   The news regarding quantum computing is a potential long-term positive, but speculative.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the data provided, a conservative approach is warranted. While analysts are generally positive and recent earnings data shows improvement, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the potential settlement, and the extremely negative expected return suggest caution. The MRI's "High Investment Recommended" signal seems overly optimistic given the other indicators. A more thorough analysis of the reasons for the negative expected return and the details of the potential settlement are crucial before making any investment decisions.

Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards, and consider conducting further due diligence before investing in HON. Specifically, further investigation is necessary to understand the discrepancy between the MRI and the negative expected return.
