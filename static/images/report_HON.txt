    *   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, indicating inconsistent growth.  The recent period (2023-2025) shows a significant decline.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown remains relatively stable, suggesting Honeywell's stock price decline are pretty consistent.

Alpha indicates how much an investment has outperformed (positive alpha) or underperformed (negative alpha) its benchmark index.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values around 1 indicate Honeywell's price tends to move similarly to the market (S&P 500).  A Beta less than one from 2021 onwards suggest lower volatility.

    *   60-day SMA: 196.1174

    The rising moving averages indicate a recent upward trend in the stock price. The fact that the 5-day SMA is above the 20-day, and the 20-day is above the 60-day SMA reinforces this bullish signal.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment). This suggests a moderate level of risk associated with investing in HON.

*   **Expected Return (%):** -794.4. This is an extremely negative expected return, indicating significant projected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon. The accuracy of the expected return should be verified, as such a large negative number is not realistic.

*   **Financial Health:** Honeywell's financials appear relatively strong, with consistent revenue and healthy profit margins.  However, the decrease in equity should be monitored.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Despite recent underperformance, analysts maintain a "Buy" consensus with a significant upside target price.
*   **Mixed Signals:** While the Hybrid Signal recommends a buy, the extremely negative expected return and the market risk indicator warrant caution. Also, the news about the $470M settlement may affect the stock price.
*   **Considerations:** Investors should carefully weigh the recent positive momentum against the long-term underperformance, the potential impact of the settlement, and the concerning expected return. The recent upward trend in earnings and revenue is a positive sign, but needs to be sustained.
