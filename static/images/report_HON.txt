## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Honeywell International Inc. is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  As of the last data point, HON's cumulative return is 64.53%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 112.47%.  This represents a difference of -47.9%.  The relative divergence of -47.9% places HON in the 14.2nd percentile of its historical range (relative to the S&P 500), indicating underperformance compared to the benchmark.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistent positive alpha (0.4) across all periods, suggesting HON has outperformed the market by approximately 4% annually. However, the high beta (ranging from 76.0 to 147.0) indicates that HON's price is highly sensitive to market movements.  The large swings in Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlight significant volatility in the stock price.  The recent negative CAGR (-3.0% in 2021-2023) is a significant concern.

* **Closing Price:** $219.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $219.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $226.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $223.08

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.74 (Suggests the stock is oversold, but this alone isn't a buy signal)
* **PPO:** -0.60 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.9 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -83.7% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further explanation and context.  Is this a typo or based on a specific model that should be detailed?)

The current price of $219.10 does not suggest a significant recent price jump or drop.  Given the negative expected return, caution is warranted.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HON shows mixed signals. While it demonstrates consistent positive alpha, suggesting outperformance relative to market risk, its high beta and significant volatility are significant concerns.  The recent negative CAGR and the extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 raise major red flags.  The current technical indicators point towards a bearish trend.  Before making any investment decisions, a more detailed analysis of the -83.7% expected return projection is crucial, along with a comprehensive comparison of key financial metrics to industry benchmarks.   A deeper dive into the reasons behind the recent underperformance and the volatility is necessary before reaching a definitive conclusion.  The data provided suggests further investigation is warranted before considering investment.
