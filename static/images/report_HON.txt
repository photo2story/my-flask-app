## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  The provided data shows HON's cumulative return of 72.60% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 122.07%.  This represents a difference of -49.5 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -49.5 places HON at the 12.2 percentile of its historical divergence range from a minimum of -59.8% to a maximum of 24.5%.  This indicates HON underperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis indicates consistent positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) averaging around 0.4, suggesting that HON tends to outperform the market, at least in some periods. However, this is inconsistent with the overall cumulative performance against the S&P 500. This discrepancy might be attributed to differing time frames analyzed. The cumulative return only covers a specific time frame, whereas the Alpha and Beta analysis involves various shorter-term periods. The Beta is consistently high (around 0.8), demonstrating HON's relatively high sensitivity to market movements.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth throughout the analyzed years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $229.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $227.18
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $228.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $216.45

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent slight upward trend. However, it is significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a stronger upward trend over a longer period.  The Last-market price of $228.97 is very close to the closing price, suggesting minimal price change since market close.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.42 (slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting a slightly bullish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.38 (negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.6 (indicates a short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests that the model does not predict any significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, based on current data)

The conflicting signals from the RSI and PPO suggest a degree of uncertainty in the short-term market direction.  The negative 20-day relative divergence change reinforces the bearish indication from the PPO.  Given a long-term investment (2 years or more) and the lack of predicted outperformance relative to the S&P 500, there's not a strong indication of this stock being exceptionally suitable for that strategy.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-10-24).  However, we will analyze based on the available unique data points:

* **Revenue:** Shows fluctuating but generally upward trend in revenue throughout the periods.
* **EPS:**  Shows some fluctuation; it isn't consistently increasing or decreasing. Note the slight dip in EPS in the quarter ending 2024-09-30.

Without expectations data, we can't determine if there were any "beats" or "misses" regarding reported earnings.  The provided numbers only show actual reported values.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue remained relatively stable but showed a slight increase over the past four quarters. Profit margin has fluctuated between approximately 34% and 39%, indicating a high level of profitability but with slight variations from quarter to quarter.  The dip in profit margin at the end of 2023 suggests possible influencing factors that need more detailed investigation.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows growth except for a minor dip in 2023-12-31 which was then reversed.  Return on Equity (ROE) shows some volatility, fluctuating around 8-9%, indicating reasonable profitability in relation to equity.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Therefore, this section cannot be completed with the information provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

HON shows mixed performance. While the company exhibits high profitability and consistent revenue, its recent performance has lagged the S&P 500. The technical indicators present a somewhat bearish outlook in the short term, while the long-term outlook isn't clearly positive, based on the provided data, particularly the expected return of 0%. Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance compared to the S&P 500, along with review of more recent news, financial filings and analyst commentary is necessary before making investment decisions. The slightly volatile nature of both profit margins and ROE should also be considered.
