2025-02-12 - Analysis Report
## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Report

**0. Overview:** Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company that develops and manufactures aerospace products and services, building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

HON's cumulative return of 54.90% significantly underperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return of 120.25% over the analyzed period.  The difference is -65.3%, placing it at the 0.0 percentile of the historical relative divergence range (max: 24.4%, min: -65.3%). This indicates HON has substantially underperformed the market benchmark.

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals mixed results:  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates significantly, showing periods of strong growth (e.g., 2017-2019),  Alpha consistently remains positive, suggesting HON outperforms the market in some periods after adjusting for the market's risk.  However, the consistently high Beta (above 0.8) indicates high volatility and strong correlation with the overall market.  It also shows a strong relationship between the market and HON.  This means that when the market is going up, HON typically goes up more than the market as a whole, and inversely when the market is going down.  However, this advantage is negated by the significant underperformance in the period under consideration.  Market cap has shown steady growth.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $206.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $210.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $219.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $224.95

The stock is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price drop (-0.76% from previous close) confirms this downward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 31.93 - This suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity for some investors, although the trend remains negative.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.80 - A negative PPO confirms the current downtrend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -9.8% -  Indicates a recent short-term decline in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** -1583.7% - This extremely negative projected return over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500 suggests significant underperformance is expected to continue unless the company's fundamentals improve dramatically.  This figure warrants careful consideration and may be overly pessimistic based on limited information.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $9.73B    | 38.54%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.58B    | 38.85%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $9.11B    | 38.68%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.44B    | 34.31%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $9.21B    | 38.45%        |

Revenue remains relatively stable, although there's a noticeable dip in the last quarter of 2023. Profit margins are consistently high, except for a drop in Q4 2023.  This warrants further investigation.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE          |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $17.41B   | 8.12%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.95B   | 9.11%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.45B   | 8.89%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $15.86B   | 7.97%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $17.23B   | 8.79%        |

Equity and ROE show some variability.  A drop in equity and ROE in Q4 2023 mirrors the profit margin drop, indicating potential underlying issues.


**6. Summary:**

HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, exhibiting substantial negative relative divergence.  While its alpha suggests periods of outperformance, its high beta indicates significant market correlation and volatility.  Recent price action shows a downtrend, supported by technical indicators (RSI, PPO) signaling oversold conditions but still negative momentum.  Earnings show some fluctuation, and financial information reveals inconsistencies requiring further investigation into the reasons for the drops observed in the last quarter of 2023.  The extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 raises significant concerns about future performance.  More comprehensive fundamental analysis, including examination of company-specific news and future projections, is needed to provide a complete assessment.  The data provided suggests caution before investing in HON.
