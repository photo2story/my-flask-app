Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company providing aerospace products and services, building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions.

The cumulative return of HON (81.58%) lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (124.78%) by 43.2 percentage points.  This places HON's performance at the 19.93 percentile relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500, based on the provided min/max range.

While alpha is generally above 1, implying outperformance, it fluctuates, and beta is consistently high (above 0.8), indicating significant correlation with market movements.  The high beta signifies higher risk compared to the market average.  Noteworthy is the negative alpha of -32.1% from 2019-2021 which strongly contrasts with other periods.
