## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  Recent performance shows underperformance relative to the S&P 500, with declining recent trends in key indicators. While long-term potential exists, current market conditions suggest a cautious approach.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Honeywell's cumulative return (43.5%) significantly lags the S&P 500's (VOO) return (72.4%) resulting in a -28.9% divergence. This places its relative divergence at the 21.3 percentile based on historical data.  The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance. While showing positive alpha in several periods, suggesting outperformance, recent years (2021-2025) show negative CAGR and increasing beta, implying greater sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Market capitalization remains substantial, exceeding $100B.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 41.0% | 56.3% | 9.0% | 0.2 | 82.4 |
| 2016-2018  | 27.0% | 63.3% | 6.0% | 0.3 | 75.6 |
| 2017-2019  | 48.0% | 63.3% | 14.0% | 0.6 | 103.4 |
| 2018-2020  | 59.0% | 63.3% | 29.0% | 0.5 | 127.1 |
| 2019-2021  | 56.0% | 59.5% | -5.0% | 0.6 | 126.7 |
| 2020-2022  | 41.0% | 71.1% | 32.0% | 0.5 | 132.9 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

HON's closing price is $194.23, down $1.21 from the previous close.  The stock is trading below its 5-day ($196.63), 20-day ($202.25), and 60-day ($208.62) moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.4082 suggests a medium risk.  The RSI (38.89) is below 50, suggesting oversold conditions, but this should be interpreted cautiously. The PPO (-0.1669) is negative, further supporting the bearish sentiment.  The recent 20-day relative divergence increase (+5.9) hints at potential short-term upward momentum, but the price drop contradicts this.  The expected return of 1.3% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is relatively low and should be considered in the context of the negative recent trends. The substantial price drop (-1.21) does not indicate a sudden rebound or crash, but rather continued downward pressure.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings show some volatility. While revenue generally increased, EPS fluctuates.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying drivers of these fluctuations.

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출        |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Honeywell shows mixed signals. While boasting strong financial fundamentals (high profit margins, increasing equity), recent stock performance lags the market significantly, and key indicators point to a bearish short-term trend.  The negative CAGR and increasing beta in the recent years raise concerns about future performance.  While the long-term outlook might still be positive considering the strong financial health, a cautious approach is warranted given the current market dynamics.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and earnings volatility is necessary before making any investment decisions.  A deeper dive into industry trends and competitive analysis would also provide a more comprehensive assessment.
