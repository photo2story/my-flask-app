**2. Recent Stock Price Movements**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 45.19
*   **PPO:** -0.54

*   **Expected Return (%):** -1425.5%

The small price change of 0.75 at the last market might reflect slight positive sentiment, but needs to be examined in the context of the longer-term trends.
