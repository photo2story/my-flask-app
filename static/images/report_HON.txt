**0. Key Figures:**

* **Cumulative Return (HON):** 31.95%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 66.94%
* **Return Difference (HON vs VOO):** -35.0%
* **Relative Divergence (HON vs VOO):** 14.6% (Indicates HON underperformed VOO, but relatively closer to the average underperformance compared to historical data)


**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Honeywell International Inc. is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  Its cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, lagging by 35 percentage points. While the relative divergence suggests this underperformance is not an extreme outlier historically, it's still a considerable difference.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO). While Alpha is mostly positive (indicating outperformance), it's highly volatile and Beta shows increasing market sensitivity over the recent years.  The significant negative CAGR in the last two years indicates recent substantial underperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $199.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $193.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $206.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $211.52

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase from the previous close ($182.86 to $199.10) represents a significant daily jump (8.88%), possibly indicating a short-term rebound.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.74 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -1.11 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.0% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -6.7% (Anticipated underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term)


The combination of high MRI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests a bearish outlook. The recent price jump may be a temporary bounce, and the long-term expected return suggests continued underperformance against the S&P 500.

Further detailed fundamental analysis, including an investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the duplicate earnings data, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
