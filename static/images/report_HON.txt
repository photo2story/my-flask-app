## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Review

This report analyzes Honeywell International Inc. (HON), a diversified technology and manufacturing company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Honeywell's cumulative return (81.69%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (123.86%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -42.17%, placing it at the 21.1th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (relative divergence).  While this indicates underperformance compared to the broader market, the historical context suggests this level of underperformance is not exceptionally unusual.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $228.99
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $229.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $215.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $209.22

The stock price is currently above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it's slightly below its 5-day moving average, indicating some recent minor price correction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (81.03):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction.
* **PPO (0.95):**  A positive value suggests bullish momentum, aligning with the price movement above the moving averages.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+9.52):**  Shows a recent increase in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided 0% expected return for long-term investment needs further clarification.  It may refer to expected *alpha* (outperformance relative to the market), rather than total return. This requires additional context and analysis.  The current price ($228.99) doesn't indicate a dramatic price swing (no significant sudden spike or crash).


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows relatively stable revenue around $9.5B-$9.7B in recent quarters. EPS fluctuates slightly, with a recent dip in the October 2024 report (2.17 vs 2.37 in July).  Further analysis is needed to compare these numbers to analyst expectations and assess whether the latest EPS is below, in line with, or above expectations.  More detailed financial statements and guidance are needed for a comprehensive assessment.


**5. Financial Information (Revenue & Profitability & Capital & Profitability):**

The provided data shows consistent revenue and relatively stable profit margins in the high 30% range during the last four quarters, with a slight dip in Q4 2023. ROE (Return on Equity) also shows some fluctuation around 8-9%. This data requires comparison to previous periods and industry benchmarks for a meaningful interpretation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

(This section requires information from recent news sources such as Shacknews and FINBOLD.  Please provide relevant news articles for analysis.  I cannot access real-time information, including news.)  The analysis would include summaries of recent earnings calls, analyst ratings, and any significant market events affecting HON.  The "Recent Market Outlook," "Analyst Opinions," and "Performance Highlights" would be included here based on the news analysis.


**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Honeywell's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 in the period reviewed, although this is not exceptionally unusual relative to its historical performance.  Recent technical indicators suggest a short-term uptrend, but the RSI points to overbought conditions.  Fundamental analysis requires a deeper dive into the recent earnings and comparing them to expectations.  Profitability remains relatively stable, but a complete picture needs comprehensive financial statements and relevant industry benchmarks. The lack of recent news data and a clearer definition of the 0% expected return prevents a fully comprehensive conclusion.


**8. Recommendations:**

Based on the limited data, HON's current valuation and future outlook require additional investigation.  The relative underperformance to the S&P 500 and the overbought RSI suggest caution.  A thorough analysis incorporating complete financial statements, analyst forecasts, and recent news is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The 0% expected return necessitates clarification and further analysis regarding expected alpha.  More information about the expected return calculation and underlying assumptions is critical for evaluating the long-term investment potential.
