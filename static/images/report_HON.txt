**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate fluctuates significantly, with recent periods showing negative growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial potential losses during the periods.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, which measures performance relative to a benchmark, is mostly negative, suggesting underperformance. The recent drop to -91% is particularly concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally around 1, indicating the stock's volatility is similar to the market. The recent jump to 2 suggests increased volatility.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated but generally increased over the years, indicating company growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 197.37
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 197.09, Previous Close: 197.37, Change: -0.14
*   **5-day SMA:** 196.97
*   **20-day SMA:** 194.75
*   **60-day SMA:** 199.33

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 60-day SMA but above the 5-day and 20-day SMAs. This *might* suggest a short-term upward trend, but the overall picture is mixed.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 64.45 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.31
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** +2.5 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return:** -625.4%

**Analysis:**

*   Despite the MRI suggesting a high investment recommendation, the extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.
*   The RSI near 65 suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory and may be due for a pullback.
*   The recent divergence change indicates a short-term upward trend, but this contradicts the longer-term underperformance.
* The Hybrid Signal is indicating Buy.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-10-23 | 2.87 | 10.41 B$    |
| 2025-07-24 | 2.46 | 10.35 B$    |

**Analysis:** Both EPS and revenue have generally been increasing over the last few quarters, which is a positive sign. The EPS and Revenue numbers from 2025-10-23 look like they might be duplicates or a typo, as the 2025-10-23 numbers have the highest EPS and Revenue, and the 2024-10-24 numbers have a similar EPS and Revenue as one of the 2025-10-23 readings.

*   **Equity:** Equity has generally decreased over the past five quarters.
*   **ROE:** ROE has generally increased over the past five quarters.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Honeywell presents a mixed investment picture:

*   **Negative Long-Term Performance:** HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The long-term expected return is extremely negative.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Recent performance indicators and news are contradictory. Some short-term indicators suggest a potential for upward movement, but institutional sentiment and the Forbes comparison need further investigation.
*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Reality:** While analysts have a "Buy" consensus, the data suggests caution.
*   **Financial Performance:** Revenue and ROE have been generally increasing, which is a positive factor.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, a strong note of **CAUTION** is warranted. The significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the negative long-term expected return, and the mixed signals from recent news and performance indicators outweigh the positive aspects of increasing revenue, ROE, and analyst ratings. Further investigation into the comparative analysis from Forbes and recent rating changes is highly recommended before making any investment decisions. The incredibly negative expected return must be investigated to determine its validity. The data suggests that the market may be pricing in something significantly negative that is not immediately apparent in the other metrics.
