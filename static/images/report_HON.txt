## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Relative Strength:**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  Over the measured period, HON's cumulative return (84.81%) lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (130.06%).  The difference is -45.2%, placing it in the 17.6th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500.  This indicates HON's underperformance relative to the broader market, particularly in recent periods (as reflected in the negative CAGR of 2% from 2021-2023).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows a consistent alpha around 0.4, suggesting HON has historically outperformed the market by a modest amount. However, the beta consistently near 0.4 indicates a relatively similar level of volatility to the market.  The significant variation in MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different periods highlights the risk associated with holding HON. The decrease in CAGR from 2019-2021 and 2021-2023 demonstrates periods of underperformance.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (nan):** Lack of data makes interpretation impossible.  A negative value would indicate short-term weakening relative to the broader market.

This suggests that, based on the provided data, there is no expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment in HON.
