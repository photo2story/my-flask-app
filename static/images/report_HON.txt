## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Review

This report analyzes Honeywell International Inc. (HON), a diversified technology and manufacturing company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Honeywell's cumulative return (69.86%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (115.96%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -46.1%, placing it at the 16.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a range of -60% to +24.5%).  This indicates HON's underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.5 suggesting it's slightly outperforming the market after adjusting for risk,  however, this is contradicted by the large negative cumulative return difference.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $226.60
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $228.80
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $228.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $222.04

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it's above its 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (52.12):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (-0.24):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence (-0.5):** Indicates a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (-68.2%):** This extremely negative projected return, relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), is concerning and requires further investigation to understand the basis of this prediction.  This dramatic negative figure needs clarification. Is this a projected alpha, a total return, or another metric?  Further details are required.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-10-24). Focusing solely on the unique entries and available information:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally fluctuated around $9.5B over the past year, with slight quarter-to-quarter variation.  A clear growth trend is not evident from this limited data.

* **EPS:** EPS has also been relatively stable, showing minor fluctuations.  There's no clear upward or downward trend observable from this data.

* **Significant Changes:** There is no clear pattern in EPS or revenue growth.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remained relatively consistent throughout the provided period, with profit margins generally hovering around 38%, showing good consistency but no significant growth. The notable drop in profit margin to 34.31% in Q4 2023 needs further investigation.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown growth, however the Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates, suggesting some variability in profitability.  The significant drop in ROE from 9.11% in Q2 2024 to 8.12% in Q3 2024 also requires further investigation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news or market outlook is provided. Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing. This information is crucial for a comprehensive analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Honeywell (HON) has shown underperformance against the S&P 500 over the given period.  While the company displays consistent revenue and relatively stable profit margins and EPS, there's no significant growth pattern observed in the limited data provided.  The negative expected return (-68.2%) is a major red flag and warrants significant investigation into its calculation methodology.  The short-term price movement indicates bearish momentum, while longer-term indicators are more neutral.  Crucial information, such as recent news, analyst opinions, and a complete understanding of the extremely negative long-term expected return, is missing and is necessary for a more complete and accurate assessment.


**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data, HON presents a mixed picture.  Consistent financials are observed, but significant growth is absent. The considerable underperformance relative to the market and the exceptionally negative projected return raise serious concerns. More comprehensive data, including recent news, analyst ratings, and a clearer explanation of the projected return calculation, are needed to provide a conclusive assessment of HON's investment prospects.
