**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  The provided data shows HON's cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  While HON achieved a cumulative return of 69.02%, VOO's return was 120.36%. This results in a difference of -51.3%, placing it at the 10.2nd percentile of the historical range of differences (min -59.9%, max 24.4%).  The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance relative to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $221.68

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $223.23

The price is slightly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum.  However, the proximity to the averages indicates potential volatility.  The recent price increase (1.12) does not suggest an extreme jump in either direction.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -4.0 – Indicates a recent short-term weakening of the relative performance compared to the benchmark.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HON's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While some technical indicators suggest potential short-term buying opportunities (oversold RSI), the extremely negative long-term expected return relative to the market is a major concern.  The recent earnings data show some inconsistencies and a slight decline in EPS.  Profitability remains strong, but the negative outlook necessitates further investigation into the factors driving the -126.1% expected return projection.  The accuracy of the provided data needs to be verified, particularly regarding the duplicate earnings entry and the extremely negative long-term expected return.  Additional fundamental analysis and a thorough review of the company's strategic direction are needed before making any investment decisions.
