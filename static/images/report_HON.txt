Okay, let's break down this Honeywell International Inc. (HON) analysis step-by-step.

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Honeywell International Inc. is a diversified technology and manufacturing company serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services, building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions.
*   **Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**
    *   HON Cumulative Return: 6.39%
    *   VOO Cumulative Return: 100.36%

    | 2018-2020  | 6.0% | 79.4% | -18.0% | 1.0 | 143.3 |
    | 2019-2021  | 19.0% | 79.4% | -28.0% | 1.2 | 140.5 |
    | 2020-2022  | 9.0% | 79.4% | 10.0% | 1.4 | 144.4 |
    | 2021-2023  | -9.0% | 77.9% | -10.0% | 1.2 | 141.3 |
    | 2022-2024  | -2.0% | 79.7% | -22.0% | 1.2 | 152.2 |
    | 2023-2025  | -25.0% | 79.7% | -90.0% | 2.0 | 130.5 |

    *Analysis:*
    *   **CAGR:**  Shows fluctuating growth, with negative growth in recent periods.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Relatively high and consistent around 70-80%, indicating significant potential for losses during downturns.
    *   **Alpha:**  Mostly negative in recent years, meaning HON has underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis. The Alpha is significantly low for the recent period (2023-2025)
    *   **Beta:** Generally above 1.0, suggesting HON is more volatile than the market. Beta has increased up to 2.0, potentially meaning HON is two times more volatile than the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close Price: 193.655
*   Last Market Price: 193.6718, Previous Close: 193.15, Change: 0.27
*   5-day SMA: 192.014
*   20-day SMA: 194.34
*   60-day SMA: 203.7178

*Analysis:* The current price is slightly above the 5-day SMA, but below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a short-term upward trend, but a potential longer-term downward trend as the 60-day SMA is significantly higher. The small positive change in the last market price suggests limited upward price fluctuations, and potentially bearish view to come.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, & Expected Return**

*   MRI (Market Risk Indicator): 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 36.4493347250745
*   PPO: 0.193
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -3.7 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   Expected Return (%): -3100.1 (Expected underperformance vs. S&P 500)

*Analysis:*

*   **MRI:** Indicates that Honeywell is a stock with medium investment.
*   **RSI:**  At 36.45, the stock is nearing oversold territory (below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity, but needs confirmation from other indicators.
*   **PPO:** Is slightly below 0, suggesting that the short term (20 days) is underperforming the long term (60 days).
*   **Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence signals a short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:**  The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, indicating significant potential for underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** The news headlines paint a concerning picture:
    *   Downgrades (Barron's)
    *   Price Target Reductions (TD Cowen)
    *   Shares Sold by Invesco
*   **Mixed Signals:**
    *   Cramer's disagreement with the downgrade suggests some bullish counter-arguments exist.
    *   DailyForex points to a potential "long" opportunity based on charts, contradicting the overall negative sentiment.
    *   Forbes suggests considering key levels for a buy or caution signal.

*Analysis:* Recent news is predominantly negative, with downgrades and reduced price targets dominating.  However, there are conflicting opinions, suggesting the situation is complex and not universally bearish.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   Target Price (avg/high/low): 241.67 / 271.00 / 205.00

This suggests analysts believe the stock is undervalued and has potential for growth. However, note that there have been recent rating changes, but without the details, the impact is unknown.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Volatility:** Beta suggests higher volatility than the market.
*   **Negative Momentum:** Negative alpha, negative divergence change, and a very concerning negative expected return all point to potential continued underperformance.
*   **Conflicting Signals:**  The analyst consensus is still "Buy," and earnings data (EPS and revenue) show a positive trend. However, recent news is overwhelmingly negative (downgrades, price target reductions).
*   **Financial Health:** Revenue and profit margins appear healthy. The equity shows decreasing trend while ROE is increasing, indicating efficient management of shareholder's capital.

*Conclusion:*  The analysis presents a mixed picture. While the underlying financial health of Honeywell seems reasonably good, the technical indicators, news sentiment, and comparative performance against the S&P 500 are concerning. The extremely negative expected return is a significant red flag. A potential investor should proceed with extreme caution, carefully weighing the positive analyst ratings and recent earnings against the overwhelming negative signals. Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and negative outlook is warranted. The conflicting news and analyst opinions suggest a lack of clear direction for the stock.
