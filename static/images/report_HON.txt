*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):**  Generally increasing over time, but dropped recently.

**Analysis:** HON's performance has deteriorated in recent years based on alpha, beta, and CAGR compared to market. The high MDD highlights the risk associated with the stock. The trend of increasing Beta indicates the stock is increasingly reactive and volatile relative to the overall market.

**Analysis:**  The stock price closed higher than the previous day, indicating a slight positive movement. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This configuration suggests a potential short-term downtrend or at least a lack of strong upward momentum.

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -977.1%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI of 35.44 is near the oversold territory (below 30), potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
*   The negative PPO suggests that short-term moving average is moving below long-term moving average, which is bearish trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests buying shares (OverSold Boost).
*   The negative divergence change indicates that HON has been underperforming the S&P 500 in the recent short-term.
*   The extremely negative expected return should be viewed with caution. Such a large negative number is highly unusual and may indicate an error in the model or data used to calculate it. It strongly suggests investors should *not* expect long-term gains relative to the S&P 500 at the moment.
