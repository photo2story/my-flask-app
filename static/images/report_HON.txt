**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind this underperformance and assess future prospects.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **HON Cumulative Return:** 58.64%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 118.31%
* **Return Difference:** -59.7% (HON underperformed VOO by 59.7%).
* **Relative Divergence:** 11.0% (This indicates that the current underperformance is in the higher 11th percentile of the historical underperformance range between HON and VOO).


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a relatively stable Beta (around 0.8-0.9), indicating HON's price movements are moderately correlated with the overall market.  Alpha, representing excess return over the market, is generally positive but fluctuates across the years, sometimes indicating significant outperformance (e.g., 2017-2019) and sometimes underperformance (e.g., 2021-2023). Market capitalization (Cap) generally increases throughout the period.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values in several periods highlight significant risk associated with investing in HON during those periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $211.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $208.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $214.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $222.53

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent small price increase (0.28%) is not substantial enough to signal a reversal of the trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (34.88):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so.
* **PPO (0.0458):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although quite weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+11.0):** Suggests short-term upward momentum relative to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (-125.2%):** This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a significant concern, indicating potential for further underperformance.  This figure needs further context to be understood properly; it is likely a highly uncertain long-term prediction and should be interpreted with great caution.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |

Earnings show some fluctuation, with a slight recent downward trend in EPS. Revenue remains relatively stable around $9.5B-$9.7B. The duplicate entry needs clarification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While the financial statements show some positive trends in revenue, profit margin, and equity, the relatively low and unstable Alpha, the high MDD in various periods, and the substantially negative projected long-term return against the S&P 500 raise serious concerns. The current price is below key moving averages, and while some technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce, the overall picture indicates caution.  The extremely negative expected return (-125.2%) requires further investigation into its calculation and underlying assumptions before drawing any conclusions.  Investors should carefully consider the risks before investing in HON.  Additional research is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The conflicting signals between the financial health data and the performance compared to the S&P 500 indicate a complex situation requiring a more in-depth analysis, possibly including industry comparisons and a broader macroeconomic assessment.
