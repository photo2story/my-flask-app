**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)**

Honeywell International Inc. is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  The cumulative return of HON is 67.15%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's cumulative return of 118.37%. The difference is -51.2%, placing it in the 10.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided min/max range.  This indicates HON has underperformed the broader market significantly over the measured period.

**2. Recent Price Movement**

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $220.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $224.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $223.17

The price is slightly below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a mild downward trend in the short-term.  The 5-day moving average being below the others strengthens this indication.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **RSI:** 28.4 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -124.2% – This suggests a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term based on the current analysis.  This is a strikingly negative prediction and should be viewed with extreme caution.  The methodology used to arrive at this figure should be critically examined.

The current price of $222.58 doesn't appear to reflect any significant recent rapid price changes (sharp upturn or downturn) based solely on the provided moving averages.  However, the low RSI suggests oversold conditions that could precede a price increase.

**7.  Overall Analysis**

HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, showing a substantial negative alpha. While the company demonstrates solid financial fundamentals with stable revenue and healthy profit margins, its recent performance is concerning. The technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce due to oversold conditions, but the long-term outlook, based on the provided -124.2% expected return, is extremely negative and requires further investigation into the methodology used to derive this figure.   Further analysis of the underlying reasons for the underperformance is critical before making any investment decisions.  The data also contains inconsistencies that need to be resolved (duplicate earnings data).  Independent verification of data is crucial.
