**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 209.08
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 206.61, Previous Close: 209.08, Change: -1.18
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 204.748
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 206.9626
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 213.303

**Analysis:** The stock is trading below its 60-day moving average, but above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages.  The recent price decline (-1.18 change) suggests potential short-term downward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 48.36 (Neutral)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.2077 (Potentially bullish if trending upwards)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -2.2 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -920.1 (Significant Underperformance Expected)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The PPO, if trending upward, could signal a potential buying opportunity. The negative change in relative divergence indicates recent underperformance. A large change of  {'price': 206.61, 'previousClose': 209.08, 'change': -1.18}  may not reflect a significant issue. The very negative expected return is a major red flag.
