* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +4.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -140.9% (This is a significant negative number. It should be clarified, as an expected return should not be this low. Possible negative values only in the context of a specific prediction of market changes, while it can not be predicted with certainty)

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |

There appears to be a duplicate entry.  Revenue is relatively stable, but EPS shows some fluctuation. More data is needed for a thorough trend analysis.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Honeywell (HON) presents a mixed picture.  While it demonstrates solid revenue and profitability, its stock performance significantly underperforms the S&P 500.  The negative alpha in recent years is a major concern.  Technical indicators suggest neither strong bullish nor bearish signals.  The extremely negative expected return needs clarification.  Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance relative to the market, alongside a more detailed earnings analysis and a reevaluation of the expected return figure, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A deeper dive into the company's specific sector performance and future growth prospects is recommended.
