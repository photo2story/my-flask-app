## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Review

This report analyzes Honeywell International Inc. (HON), a Fortune 100 company that develops and manufactures aerospace systems, building technologies, performance materials, and technologies.  The analysis incorporates provided financial data, market indicators, and recent news.


**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Honeywell's cumulative return (81.69%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (123.86%) over the unspecified period.  The difference is -42.17%, placing it in the 21.1th percentile of the historical range of relative performance (-60.82% to 27.57%).  This indicates HON's performance has lagged behind the broader market. The provided CAGR data shows variable performance across different periods, with some periods exceeding the S&P 500's likely return, but overall consistently below the given benchmark.  Alpha values generally hover around 1, suggesting performance is roughly in line with the market, except for 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 which show alpha values below 1,  indicating underperformance against the benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $228.99
* **5-day Moving Average:** $229.47
* **20-day Moving Average:** $215.70
* **60-day Moving Average:** $209.22

The stock price is currently above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. However, it's slightly below its 5-day moving average, hinting at a potential minor short-term correction.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 81.03 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.95 – A positive PPO indicates an upward momentum, although the value needs context within a broader historical range.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +9.52 – This confirms a short-term upward trend.

The current price ($228.99) is not exceptionally high given the recent trend, and doesn't suggest a sharp reversal. The expected return is 0.0%, but this is likely based on a specific model not provided.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy involving consistent contributions would likely offer some level of diversification against S&P 500 risks, but significant S&P 500 outperformance is unlikely based on the presented data.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows relatively stable revenue, ranging from $9.11B to $9.73B over the last five quarters. EPS fluctuates slightly,  but doesn't show a clear declining trend.  More information is needed on the expected EPS for the most recent quarter (2024-10-24) to provide a more robust analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data indicates consistent profitability, with profit margins generally hovering around 38%, exhibiting a slight dip in Q4 2023. ROE (Return on Equity) is healthy and relatively consistent, around 8-9%, although fluctuating quarter to quarter. These figures suggest a financially sound company.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **(Missing Data):**  The prompt requests news within the last two days from sources like shacknews and Finbold.  This information is crucial for a complete analysis but is absent from the provided data.  Without access to recent news, analyst opinions and market outlook cannot be accurately assessed.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Honeywell (HON) demonstrates consistent revenue and profitability. However, its stock performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 over the given period.  Technical indicators suggest overbought conditions and a recent upward trend, but this needs further investigation in light of missing news and outlook data. The lack of detailed information on the expected earnings and recent market events prevents a more definitive conclusion.  Further research is necessary to account for factors missing from this report.

**8. Recommendations:**

A long-term investment in HON might be considered within a diversified portfolio, however, based on the data provided, outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is not guaranteed.  Closely monitoring market conditions and financial news is crucial before any investment decision. The absence of crucial news data prevents a strong buy or sell recommendation.
