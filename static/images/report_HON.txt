## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Relative Strength:**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company, operating across various sectors like aerospace, building technologies, performance materials and technologies, and safety and productivity solutions.

The cumulative return of HON (69.46%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (122.83%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -53.4%, placing it in the 7.7th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, based on provided data. This indicates HON's underperformance relative to the broader market. The provided alpha consistently remains around 0.4, indicating a modest outperformance relative to the market, but the beta fluctuates and the CAGR varies significantly over different periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $225.66
* **5-day Moving Average:** $223.82
* **20-day Moving Average:** $223.95
* **60-day Moving Average:** $223.59

The recent price is slightly above the 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a modestly positive short-term trend.  However, the difference is minimal, indicating a relatively flat price movement recently.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 49.49 –  Approaching the neutral level (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.1355 – A positive value indicates bullish momentum, albeit weak.
* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** -1.9% – Indicates a slight weakening of relative strength.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** The provided data shows a recent decrease of 1.9% in relative strength (-), which indicates short-term downtrend.
* **Expected Return:** -174.7% – This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) horizon is a significant concern and requires further investigation. The basis for this calculation is not provided and needs clarification.  This figure warrants a thorough review of the underlying assumptions and methodology. Given the previous closing price of $223.09 and the recent increase of $1.15 (a 0.52% gain), a significant negative expected return would indicate a major downward projection.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  While there's no clear upward or downward trend, it's worth noting that revenue has remained relatively stable around $9.5B-$9.7B in the last two quarters, while EPS fluctuates between $2.17 and $2.37.  Further analysis is needed to understand the factors driving these variations. There is also a duplicate entry for October 24, 2024 which needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively consistent over the past year, hovering around $9B. Profit margins are generally high and stable, fluctuating between 34% and 39%, suggesting strong profitability.  However, a dip to 34.31% in Q4 2023 is notable.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been relatively stable, with some fluctuations. ROE (Return on Equity) also fluctuates, indicating some variability in the company's profitability based on the equity invested. Again, a dip in Q4 2023 is noteworthy.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

HON's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While profitability metrics are generally strong, the projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is exceptionally negative (-174.7%), raising serious concerns.  The short-term price movement is relatively flat.  Earnings show some volatility but remain relatively stable.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers behind the significantly negative long-term projected return and the fluctuations in EPS and ROE.  The consistency of Revenue and relatively high profit margins are positive signs, but the lackluster return relative to the S&P 500 needs to be fully investigated.  The extreme negative expected return needs to be reconciled with the positive aspects of the company performance.


**8. Disclaimer:**  This analysis is based solely on the limited data provided. It is not a recommendation to buy or sell HON stock.  A comprehensive investment decision should be made after thorough due diligence and consideration of additional factors, including industry trends, competitive landscape, and a detailed understanding of the methodology used to calculate the expected return.
