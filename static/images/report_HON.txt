**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance):**

*   **[2025-12-12] Honeywell International Inc. $HON Shares Bought by Quantinno Capital Management LP:** This indicates that at least one institutional investor sees value in HON, providing a slightly positive counterpoint to the downgrades.
*   **[2025-12-12] How Investors Are Reacting To Honeywell International (HON) Adding Indra Nooyi To Its Board:** Board member changes often signal strategic shifts. Indra Nooyi is a respected business leader, so this could be viewed positively.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   Number of Opinions: 23
*   Target Price: 237.02 (Avg) / 271.00 (High) / 195.00 (Low)
*   Recent Rating Changes: (Not provided)

**Analysis:**

*   The consensus is "Buy," which contrasts with the negative news headlines and poor returns. This discrepancy needs further investigation. Are the analysts lagging in their assessment, or do they see something the market doesn't?
*   The target price range is wide (195-271), indicating uncertainty among analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출    |
|------------|------|---------|

| 2025-04-29 | 2.24 | 9.82 B$ |
| 2024-10-24 | 2.17 | 9.73 B$ |
| 2025-10-23 | 2.17 | 9.73 B$ |

**Analysis:**
* There appears to be duplicate of 2024-10-24 data (2.17/9.73B) entered for 2025-10-23 as well in the table, I am assuming the 2025-10-23 (2.87/10.41B) numbers are correct and continuing with my analysis on that.
*   **Trend:** EPS and Revenue generally increased in the recent quarters, although there was a slight decline in revenue from Q2 to Q3 2025, and a notable jump in EPS in Q4 2025.
*   **Positive Signal:** The increasing EPS and revenue suggest potential improvements in profitability and sales.
*   **Inconsistency:** There is a large inconsistency between table rows (there are two 2025-10-23), and I am assuming the 2.87/10.41B numbers are correct and continuing with my analysis.

*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are showing signs of improvements over the last several quarters.
*   **Analyst Disagreement:** Despite negative news, analysts maintain a "Buy" rating, but the wide target price range signals uncertainty. It is highly recommended to scrutinize the research reports of these analysts.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The short term technical indicators are slightly positive, but not enough to offset the very negative divergence between the cumulative return of HON and S&P500.
*    **Expected Return:** The *extremely* negative expected return (-1564.9%) is a major red flag, indicating the model forecasts substantial long-term underperformance.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the data provided, a **SELL** or **AVOID** recommendation is warranted.

*   The underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative news sentiment, and the alarmingly negative expected return strongly outweigh any positive signals from analyst ratings or earnings growth. The double downgrade is a critical warning sign.
*   Further research is needed to understand the discrepancy between analyst ratings and the overall negative outlook. What are the analysts seeing that the market is missing?
