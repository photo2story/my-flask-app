**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 200.74
* **Last Market Price:** 214.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 197.45
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 200.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 207.49

The last market price (214.13) shows a recent price increase of 1.61 compared to the previous close. This indicates a recent price jump. The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting some short-term momentum but still some room to recover fully.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.98 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.27 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.0% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.9% (This is a low expected return relative to risk.)  A 0.9% expected return over the long term (2+ years) represents a modest outperformance of the S&P 500, suggesting that a potential for greater returns exists if the stock price rebounds from current low prices.

The recent price jump should be considered in the context of the other indicators.  While the price increased, the RSI and PPO still do not strongly suggest a bullish reversal.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

HON has shown a period of underperformance compared to the S&P 500, particularly in recent years.  While the company demonstrates consistent profitability and stable revenue, the recent negative CAGR and high MDD highlight significant risk. The technical indicators present a mixed picture, with some suggesting oversold conditions, while others indicate only moderate positive momentum.  The low expected return, despite a recent price jump, indicates caution.  A long-term (2+ year) investment strategy might be considered only if the investor is comfortable with the medium-to-high risk and accepts the modest potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500. Further investigation into the reasons for recent underperformance and future growth prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data requires clarification.
