*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.02

*   **Expected Return (%):** -2844.9%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.8 indicates a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 50.02 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests a "Buy" recommendation, indicating a positive outlook based on the provided data and potentially automated analysis.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** The negative change in relative divergence suggests underperformance compared to the benchmark (VOO) in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** The very large negative expected return (-2844.9%) is highly unusual and likely an error or requires further context to interpret. It suggests extremely poor projected performance compared to the S&P 500 over a 2+ year investment horizon.
