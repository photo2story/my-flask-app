Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Honeywell International Inc. (HON) based on the data provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Honeywell International Inc. is a diversified technology and manufacturing company serving customers worldwide with aerospace products, building and industrial control technologies, and performance materials.
*   **Return Comparison:**
    *   HON Cumulative Return: 8.82%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 99.09%
    *   Divergence: -90.9 (Relative Divergence: 5.3)
*   **Analysis:** HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The divergence is substantial, and the relative divergence suggests that HON's underperformance is near its worst levels within the recent historical range.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 33.0% | 67.3% | 5.0% | -0.0 | 99.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 15.0% | 71.0% | 0.0% | 0.1 | 89.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 29.0% | 71.1% | 7.0% | 1.0 | 119.3 |
| 2018-2020  | 6.0% | 79.4% | -18.0% | 1.0 | 143.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 19.0% | 79.4% | -28.0% | 1.2 | 140.5 |
| 2020-2022  | 9.0% | 79.4% | 10.0% | 1.4 | 144.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -9.0% | 77.9% | -10.0% | 1.2 | 141.3 |
| 2022-2024  | -2.0% | 79.7% | -22.0% | 1.2 | 152.2 |
| 2023-2025  | -23.0% | 79.7% | -86.0% | 2.0 | 133.5 |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate fluctuates, showing periods of strong growth (2015-2017) and recent decline (2023-2025).
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant potential for loss from peak to trough during these periods.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha value is generally negative in recent years, which means the stock is underperforming relative to its benchmark (likely the S&P 500). The sharp negative Alpha in the 2023-2025 period (-86%) is very concerning.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally around 1 or higher, suggesting HON's price tends to move in the same direction as the market, and possibly with slightly more volatility. The Beta value has been increasing.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close Price: $198.08
*   Previous Close: $199.89
*   Change: -$0.91
*   5-day SMA: 197.468
*   20-day SMA: 192.898
*   60-day SMA: 200.3445

*   **Analysis:** The stock price closed slightly lower than the previous day. The 5-day SMA is below the close price, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend. The 20-day SMA is below the 5-day SMA, confirming the downtrend. However, both the 5-day and 20-day SMA are below the 60-day SMA, which could be interpreted as a potential buying opportunity if an upward trend reverses.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 65.40
*   PPO: 0.684
*   Hybrid Signal: Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = 5.2 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   Expected Return (%): -557.8

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests a moderate level of risk.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 65.40 indicates that the stock is approaching overbought conditions, which would normally imply a risk.
    *   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 0.684 is very small, which does not provide a strong signal.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is buy.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent positive change in relative divergence hints at a short-term upward movement.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-557.8%) is highly concerning. It suggests that, based on the model, a long-term investment in HON from the current point is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes:**

    *   **Spin-Off:** The Solstice spin-off seems to be a key event.
    *   **Analyst Activity:** There are reports about analyst forecasts and rating changes, as well as insider buying.
    *   **Stock Performance:**  News sources are reporting on Honeywell's stock performance and comparing it to competitors like 3M.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.07)
*   **Target Price:** $237.40 (Average), $271.00 (High), $195.00 (Low)
*   **Analysis:** Analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy" rating. The average target price of $237.40 suggests potential upside from the current price of $198.08.  However, the low target price of $195.00 indicates some analysts see potential downside. The lack of information about recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the trend in analyst sentiment.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The large negative divergence is a primary concern.
*   **Financial Performance:** Revenue and EPS have been growing. Recent quarterly results show improvement, with strong revenue growth and an increase in ROE. However, profit margins appear to have decreased slightly in the most recent quarter. The increase in ROE is good, but needs to be sustained to show true improvement.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The short-term technical indicators are mixed. The RSI is approaching overbought, while the moving averages suggest a possible short-term downtrend but potentially a buying opportunity.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and a target price suggesting upside. However, there's a range of target prices, indicating some uncertainty.
*   **Risk:** The high Maximum Drawdown in the Alpha/Beta analysis highlights the risk associated with the stock. The model projects a concerning expected return.
*   **News:** The recent news focuses on a Solstice spin-off, analyst ratings, and comparisons to competitors. The spin-off could be a catalyst for future performance.
*   **Overall:** While recent earnings data is positive, the long-term underperformance compared to the market, the negative Alpha, and the extremely negative expected return suggest caution. The spin-off could represent a turning point, but it's too early to tell. Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before investing in HON. Monitoring the spin-off and the subsequent financial performance is crucial.
