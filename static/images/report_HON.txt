2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down this Honeywell (HON) analysis.

**1. Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Honeywell International Inc. is a diversified technology and manufacturing company serving customers worldwide.
*   **Return Rate:** HON's cumulative return (10.67%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) return (91.00%).
*   **Divergence:** The divergence between HON and VOO is -81.1, with a relative divergence of 2.8. This means HON is currently performing near the *bottom* of its historical range compared to the S&P 500. It's not a good sign.

**Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD Table Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2016-2018  | 2.0%    | 19.7% | -2.0%  | 0.9   | 83.9   |
| 2017-2019  | 23.0%   | 19.7% | 5.0%   | 1.0   | 112.4  |
| 2018-2020  | 4.0%    | 19.7% | -17.0% | 1.1   | 135.1  |
| 2019-2021  | 17.0%   | 18.8% | -27.0% | 1.1   | 132.4  |
| 2020-2022  | 8.0%    | 17.6% | 10.0%  | 1.0   | 136.1  |
| 2021-2023  | -8.0%   | 17.6% | -9.0%  | 0.8   | 133.2  |
| 2022-2024  | -1.0%   | 17.0% | -20.0% | 0.8   | 143.5  |
| 2023-2025  | -16.0%  | 19.7% | -78.0% | 0.8   | 131.5  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR has been volatile, with some strong years (2017-2019), but more recently experiencing negative growth (2021-2025). This indicates inconsistent performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** MDD is fairly consistent, hovering around 17-20%.  This means that from peak to trough, investors have experienced roughly this level of loss in the given periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is generally negative, and significantly negative in the recent period, meaning HON is underperforming relative to its risk (Beta).
*   **Beta:** Beta is close to 1, suggesting HON's price tends to move similarly to the overall market, but recently decreasing to 0.8, suggesting it is less sensitive to overall market movements.
*   **Cap(B) Market Cap:** Market cap increased steadily through 2022, but has declined slightly recently.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 195.88
*   **Previous Close:** 195.09 (Change of 0.4)
*   **5-day SMA:** 196.358
*   **20-day SMA:** 195.413
*   **60-day SMA:** 195.4524

The 5-day SMA is slightly above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This *could* suggest a minor short-term upward trend, but the SMAs are all very close together, indicating sideways movement overall.  The small change from the previous close confirms a lack of strong momentum.

**3. RSI, PPO, Delta Divergence, & Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment).  While not the riskiest category, it's not the most attractive either.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 55.7. This is a neutral reading. Above 70 is typically considered overbought, and below 30 is oversold.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.0109. Close to zero, suggesting a lack of strong momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-04). A 'buy' signal, but tempered by the MRI and safe label.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.5 (+): 단기상승 (short-term increase). Suggests a slight recent improvement relative to its divergence from VOO.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1031.1.  This is a very large negative number. It suggests a strongly *negative* expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years).  This is a major red flag.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **[2025-12-31] Army contract modification:**  A $58.8 million contract modification is a relatively small amount for a company of Honeywell's size, but any negative news can impact sentiment.
*   **[2025-12-16] Indra Nooyi Board Member:** Adding a well-respected figure like Indra Nooyi could be viewed positively.
*   **[2025-12-22] Flexjet problem, lowered profit outlook:** This is significant *negative* news. A $470 million problem and lowered profit outlook are concerning.
*   **[2025-12-05] HON vs. 3M:** Competitive analysis is useful for understanding relative positioning.
*   **[2026-01-03] Synergy Asset Management LLC Increases Holdings:** Positive signal, indicating some institutional investors see value.
*   **[2026-01-03] Barclays Sees Renewed Investor Interest:** Also positive, indicating analyst optimism.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean = 2.07).  Analysts generally have a positive view.
*   **Target Price:** 236.61 (average). This suggests potential upside from the current price.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not available.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| 2025-09-30 | $16.78B   | 10.87% |
| 2025-06-30 | $16.09B   | 9.75%  |

| 2024-09-30 | $17.41B   | 8.12%  |

*   **Equity:** Equity has decreased, which is a potential concern. It requires further investigation to understand the reason (e.g., share buybacks, dividends, losses).
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE has been improving, indicating the company is generating more profit from its equity.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Honeywell presents a mixed picture. While the recent earnings reports show improved revenue and EPS, and analysts have a generally positive outlook, there are several concerning factors:

*   **Significant Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** HON has significantly lagged behind the S&P 500 in terms of returns. The large negative divergence and expected return are major warnings.
*   **Negative Alpha:** The consistently negative alpha indicates the stock is not generating returns commensurate with its risk, and is especially poor recently.
*   **Flexjet Issue and Lowered Profit Outlook:** This recent negative news item is a material concern.
*   **Decreasing Equity:** While ROE is improving, the decrease in equity warrants further investigation.
*   **Inconsistent CAGR:** Historical performance shows inconsistent year over year growth.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data provided, a *cautious* approach to investing in HON is warranted. While analyst ratings are positive and recent earnings are improving, the significant underperformance vs. the market, negative alpha, Flexjet issue, and decreasing equity raise red flags.

**Before investing, you should:**

*   Investigate the cause of the equity decline.
*   Assess the long-term impact of the Flexjet problem and lowered profit outlook.
*   Consider the opportunity cost of investing in HON versus the S&P 500, given the historical divergence and poor expected returns.

The "Buy" signal from the hybrid system should be viewed with skepticism, given the weight of negative indicators.
