**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $223.72
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $223.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $222.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $225.32

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a minor downward trend in the short term.  However, it's above the long-term 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.  The recent price change of -$0.15 does not represent a significant or rapid movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.24 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.11 (Slightly positive, suggesting a potential upward trend)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +4.6% (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (vs VOO, long-term):** -140.9%  This extremely negative expected return warrants further investigation.  The extremely large negative value suggests a significant projected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, possibly indicating a high level of risk or flawed model used to generate this projection.  Clarification on the methodology used to derive this number is necessary.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|

| 2024-07-25 | 2.37 | $9.58 Billion  |

| 2024-10-24 | 2.29 | $9.21 Billion  | *(Note: Duplicate entry)*


Revenue shows a relatively stable trend, although EPS exhibits some volatility. There's a potential data error with the duplicated entry for October 24, 2024.  Further investigation is needed to understand the fluctuations in EPS and ensure data accuracy.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, despite showing positive Alpha in some periods. Recent price action shows a minor downward trend, but technical indicators are not strongly bearish. Earnings show some volatility in EPS but consistent revenue. Financial health appears sound, based on the provided data. The extremely negative long-term expected return (-140.9%) needs critical examination due to its magnitude and the potential for significant risk or error in its calculation.  Further investigation into the data discrepancies (duplicate entry), the -140.9% expected return calculation methodology, and a deeper dive into sector-specific analysis is needed before drawing definitive conclusions about HON's investment prospects.  The current data alone provides a mixed picture, necessitating more thorough due diligence.
