However, the recent period (2022-2025) indicates negative CAGR and significantly negative Alpha, aligning with the overall underperformance against VOO.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in the reviewed period. While some positive alpha has been observed in past years, recent trends indicate a weaker performance. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook.  The lack of comprehensive financial information limits the depth of the analysis.  The positive expected return of 0.9% over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500, however, suggests potential for long-term value, though further investigation into the fundamentals is crucial before making investment decisions.  Considering the current market conditions and lack of sufficient financial data, a thorough review of HON's financial statements and future projections is highly recommended before investment.
