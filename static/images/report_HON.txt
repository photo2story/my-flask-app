Very negative expected return suggests poor long-term growth prospects relative to the broader market.
*   **Positive Factors:** Recent increase in EPS and revenue. Generally strong profit margins. Analyst consensus is "Buy," with price targets above the current price. Recent short-term upward price momentum.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests high investment recommendation which is contradictory to the expected return.

**Conclusion:** While analysts are generally positive and the company has shown some recent financial improvements, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative alpha, and negative long-term expected return are significant concerns. The news flow leans negative. The MRI is contradicting the expected return. A cautious approach is warranted. Further research is needed to determine the reasons behind the underperformance and the validity of the very negative expected return. It would be wise to carefully consider the potential impact of the $470M settlement.
