**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $221.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $222.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $222.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $224.74

The price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.72 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.03 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, though weak)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.2 (Short-term upward momentum)

The relatively small price change from the previous close suggests a lack of significant recent volatility.  The expected return of -194% is extremely negative and highly unlikely. This likely reflects a model error or an unrealistic long-term prediction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue, but no clear upward or downward trend.  Note there's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24.  A more thorough analysis would require additional data and context.

**5. Financial Information:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $9.73B | 38.54% |

|---------|---------|------|
| 2024-09-30 | $17.41B | 8.12% |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.95B | 9.11% |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.45B | 8.89% |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined, despite showing some positive alpha in several periods. Recent price action suggests a potential downward trend. While the company demonstrates strong profit margins and relatively stable revenue, the overall performance relative to the market is a major concern.  The extremely negative predicted return is likely erroneous.  Further in-depth analysis, including industry comparisons and a review of the company's long-term strategic plan, is necessary for a complete evaluation. The -194% expected return needs to be disregarded.
