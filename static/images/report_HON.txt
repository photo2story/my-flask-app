## Honeywell International Inc (HON) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  The provided data shows mixed performance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO). While HON has achieved positive cumulative returns, it underperformed VOO significantly. Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of this underperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **HON Cumulative Return:** 55.10%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 91.19%
* **Return Difference:** -36.1%
* **Relative Underperformance:** 22.5% (This means HON's underperformance relative to VOO is at the 22.5th percentile of its historical range of under/outperformance.)

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO).  While alpha is generally positive (indicating outperformance), it fluctuates, and beta is consistently high, suggesting high sensitivity to market movements.  The significant negative return (-3% and -12%) in the last two years are particularly concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $214.17
* **Last Market Price:** $210.63
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $212.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $210.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.43

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential short-term downside pressure.  However, itâ€™s above the 20-day moving average, indicating some short-term support. The recent price change of $0.14 from the previous close indicates relatively stable price action, without a significant surge or drop.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 49.17 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.34 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -8.3% (Long-term underperformance relative to S&P 500 is expected.)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO suggests positive momentum, the relatively low RSI and negative expected return signal caution. The small positive change in the 20-day relative divergence implies a mild short-term upward trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HON's performance has been mixed. While it exhibits healthy financial metrics like profitability and steady revenue growth, its recent stock price performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly.  The negative expected return and inconsistent alpha suggest caution.  The relatively high beta indicates susceptibility to market fluctuations. Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the duplicate earnings data entry is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Considering the high beta, a long-term investment strategy should incorporate risk management strategies.  The current valuation needs to be examined in conjunction with future earnings estimates to justify long-term investment.
