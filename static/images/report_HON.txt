**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  The provided data shows a cumulative return significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons for this underperformance.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **HON Cumulative Return:** 54.16%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 89.44%
* **Return Difference:** -35.28%  (HON underperformed VOO by 35.28% based on the provided cumulative returns)
* **Relative Underperformance:** 23.4% (This signifies HON's position relative to its historical performance range against VOO. It's not an absolute measure of outperformance.)

The alpha and beta analysis reveals mixed performance relative to the market. While positive alphas are present in several periods indicating outperformance, the recent periods show negative CAGR and a high beta suggesting high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $212.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $210.85
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $213.79

The price is slightly below its 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term bearish trend. However, it's above the 5 and 20-day moving averages suggesting some support.  The recent price increase of $0.8 (0.8%)  from the previous close is a relatively small, positive movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.89 (Approaching overbought territory)

* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +4.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -8.3% (Long-term (2+ years) expected underperformance relative to the S&P 500)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While RSI is nearing overbought levels,  PPO indicates positive momentum. The negative expected return reinforces concerns about HON's underperformance compared to the broader market.  The recent small positive price change doesn't signal a significant shift in the overall trend.
