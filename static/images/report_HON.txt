2024-12-18 - Analysis Report
## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Review

This report analyzes Honeywell International Inc. (HON), a diversified technology and manufacturing company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Honeywell's cumulative return of 75.66% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's 120.85% over the analyzed period.  The difference is -45.2%, placing it at the 17.3rd percentile of the historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-59.8% to 24.5%). This indicates HON's performance has lagged behind the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently around 0.4 suggests that HON delivered returns slightly above what would be expected based solely on its beta (market risk exposure), although this is modest.  The variable beta across different years likely reflects shifts in market sentiment and industry dynamics.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $233.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $230.70
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $229.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $218.38

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (53.96):** Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions; the market is relatively neutral.
* **PPO (-0.06):** A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum, potentially countering the positive trend suggested by moving averages.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (3.1%):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend.

The provided expected return of 0.0% is a significant concern.  This suggests that, even with a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy,  no outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected. Given the current price of $233.13, there's no indication of a significant price jump or crash based on the provided data alone.  Further analysis is needed to assess potential market shifts.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Shows relatively stable revenue around $9.5B, with some minor fluctuations. There is no clear upward or downward trend.
* **EPS:** EPS fluctuates, with no consistent upward or downward trend.  There is no clear pattern.  Comparing quarter-over-quarter earnings offers no simple pattern.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable but profit margins show some fluctuation, although they generally remain high (34-39%).  The dip in Q4 2023 (34.31%) warrants further investigation.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is generally increasing, but ROE is also volatile.  This suggests an inconsistent profitability despite relatively stable revenue.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent earnings news (within the past two days) or analyst opinions are provided. Information about the recent market outlook is needed to complete the analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) shows mixed signals. While recent price action suggests a short-term upward trend, the lagging performance relative to the S&P 500 (a -45.2% difference), a negative PPO, and a projected 0.0% expected return raise concerns about future performance.  Earnings are relatively stable but don't show a strong growth trend, and the recent dip in profit margins deserves attention.  More detailed market outlook information and analyst opinions would significantly improve the completeness of this analysis.


**8. Recommendations:**

Based on the limited data, a cautious approach is recommended.  The lack of clear upward trends in earnings, revenue growth, and a significantly negative performance relative to the S&P 500 necessitates further due diligence before any investment decision.  A deeper investigation into the reasons behind the lagging performance and the Q4 2023 profit margin drop is crucial.  The lack of recent news and analyst sentiment makes an accurate assessment difficult.  Investors should closely monitor future earnings reports, news releases, and analyst upgrades/downgrades before making any significant investment decisions.
