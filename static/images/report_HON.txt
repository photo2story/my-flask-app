*   **Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Analysis:**

    | Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B)  |

    | 2023-2025  | -22.0% | 79.7%  | -87.0%  | 2.0    | 132.7   |

    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows variable performance across different periods, with a concerning negative CAGR in the most recent period.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant potential losses during the examined periods.
    *   **Alpha:** The alpha has been negative in recent periods, indicating underperformance relative to the benchmark after accounting for risk.  The most recent period shows a very substantial negative alpha.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is consistently around 1 or higher, suggesting that HON's price movements are correlated with the market and potentially more volatile than the market. The recent increase in beta to 2 suggests the stock's volatility has significantly increased relative to the market.
    *   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has fluctuated, with a recent decline from peak values, indicating a potential decrease in investor confidence.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close: 199.11
*   Last-market: price: 196.93, previousClose: 195.5, change: 0.73
*   5-day SMA: 198.56
*   20-day SMA: 193.45
*   60-day SMA: 200.20

*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day SMAs but below the 60-day SMA.  This suggests a short-term upward trend but potential resistance at the 60-day SMA. The positive change from the previous close suggests a slight upward momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO, MRI, Hybrid Signal, Expected Return**

*   MRI: 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 65.41
*   PPO: 0.67
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = 2.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   Expected Return (%): -625.4

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   The RSI of 65.41 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), suggesting the stock might be due for a pullback.
    *   The PPO of 0.67 indicates that the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, confirming the short-term upward trend suggested by the SMAs.
    *   The "Hybrid Signal" is recommending buying, but the context is important. The model suggests fully investing available cash and a small monthly investment, labeling it "very safe" with an MRI of 0.90 (which is a contradiction to overall MRI of 0.8).
    *   The positive recent change in relative divergence suggests recent outperformance compared to its historical relationship with the S&P 500.
    *   The **extremely negative expected return (-625.4%)** is a significant red flag. This figure implies that the model anticipates substantial underperformance in the long term compared to the S&P 500 if an investment is made at this point. This needs to be thoroughly investigated.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Several headlines indicate negative near-term sentiment:
    *   "Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Sinks As Market Gains"
    *   "Honeywell Stock Tumbles on Potential $470M Settlement"
    *   "DZ Bank Has Lowered Expectations for Honeywell International (NASDAQ:HON) Stock Price"
*   **Mixed Sentiment:** Some articles offer a more nuanced view:
    *   "HON Stock vs. 3M: Which Industrial Giant Looks Stronger in 2025" (Implies a comparison and potential competition)
    *   "New Analyst Forecast: $HON Given $250 Price Target" (Positive target, but it's just one analyst)
*   **Analysis:** The news flow appears predominantly negative, citing potential settlements and underperformance relative to the market. This reinforces the concerns raised by the return rate divergence. The analyst target price suggests potential upside, but this contrasts with the overall negative sentiment.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   Consensus: Buy (Mean: 2.07)
*   Target Price: $236.61 (Avg)
*   Recent Rating Changes: Not available

*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is a "Buy" with an average target price of $236.61, which represents a significant premium over the current price. This conflicts with the overall negative view from other signals. The lack of recent rating change information prevents us from understanding whether analysts are revising their estimates in response to current market conditions.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출      |

*   **Analysis:** The earnings per share (EPS) and revenue show an upward trend over the analyzed quarters, suggesting solid fundamental performance. The most recent EPS is notably higher than the previous year's comparable quarter.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $10.41B     | 34.08%       |
| 2025-06-30   | $10.35B     | 38.86%       |
| 2025-03-31   | $9.82B      | 38.54%       |
| 2024-12-31   | $10.09B     | 36.38%       |
| 2024-09-30   | $9.73B      | 38.54%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity      | ROE       |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $16.78B     | 10.87%    |
| 2025-06-30   | $16.09B     | 9.75%     |
| 2025-03-31   | $17.46B     | 8.30%     |
| 2024-12-31   | $18.62B     | 6.90%     |
| 2024-09-30   | $17.41B     | 8.12%     |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue:** Revenue has generally increased, suggesting strong business performance.
    *   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have fluctuated but remain healthy.
    *   **Equity:** Equity has decreased over the recent quarters. A decreasing equity base isn't always negative, especially if the company is deploying capital effectively or returning value to shareholders through buybacks or dividends. However, it's important to understand the reasons behind the decline.
    *   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) has increased significantly in the most recent quarter. A higher ROE indicates that the company is generating more profit from each dollar of shareholder equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Mixed Signals:** The analysis presents a complex picture with conflicting signals.
    *   **Negative:**  Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high MDD, negative alpha, predominantly negative news sentiment, equity decline, and an alarming negative expected return. The increase in beta raises additional concerns about the stock's volatility.
    *   **Positive:** Analyst consensus is "Buy", increasing EPS, recent ROE increase, short-term upward price trend (SMA analysis), and the "Hybrid Signal" recommendation (although its risk assessment appears flawed).
*   **Key Concerns:** The most critical concern is the extremely negative expected return (-625.4%). This warrants immediate further investigation to understand the underlying model's assumptions and potential flaws. The negative news flow regarding a potential settlement and lowered expectations also adds to the concern. The equity decline, high MDD, negative alpha, and the company's volatility are also concerning.
*   **Recommendation:** Due to the conflicting signals, especially the alarming negative expected return, a conservative approach is warranted.
    *   **Avoid investing until the negative expected return is thoroughly investigated and explained.**
    *   Carefully evaluate the impact of the potential $470M settlement.
    *   Monitor the company's equity levels and understand the reasons for the recent decline.
    *   Consider the relatively high volatility (Beta) in the context of your own risk tolerance.
    *   The positive analyst consensus should be taken with a grain of salt given the other negative signals.

In conclusion, while Honeywell shows some positive aspects, the significant red flags warrant caution. Further investigation and risk assessment are necessary before making any investment decisions.
