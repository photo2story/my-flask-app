**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  While alpha generally suggests outperformance (positive values), and beta measures market sensitivity (1 represents market performance), HON's results are inconsistent.  High beta values (e.g., 0.8-0.9) suggest significant sensitivity to market fluctuations, contributing to both its high gains and losses during the observed periods. Noteworthy is the negative CAGR of -3% in 2021-2023 and -5% in 2023-2025, highlighting periods of underperformance.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally increased, indicating company growth.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Honeywell (HON) currently shows mixed signals. While financial health (profitability, revenue) appears strong,  the stock's significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-60.2%) and the projected long-term underperformance (-132.7%) are major concerns.  Technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term price bounce, but the long-term outlook requires careful consideration.  The negative CAGR in recent years and high beta suggest significant market sensitivity, potentially increasing risk.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the negative expected return and a comparison of HON's performance against its sector peers are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided -132.7% expected return seems exceptionally pessimistic and warrants further investigation into its source and assumptions.
