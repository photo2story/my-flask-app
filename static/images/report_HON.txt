* **20-Day Moving Average:** $206.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $211.12

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend. The recent price drop of $2.87 from the previous close further reinforces this downward pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)  This suggests a moderate level of market uncertainty.
* **RSI:** 37.81 (Below 40, suggesting the stock is oversold)

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence strongly suggests a bearish trend in the short term. The significant price drop reflects negative market sentiment.  Long-term (2+ years) expected outperformance versus the S&P 500 is uncertain based solely on this data and requires a more comprehensive forecast.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HON is currently underperforming the S&P 500, showing a bearish trend supported by technical indicators and recent price action. While earnings remain relatively strong, recent profit margin and ROE numbers are showing signs of softening, and the significant drop below the moving averages warrants caution. The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity, so external market factors will significantly impact future performance.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent EPS decline and the long-term growth prospects of the company is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The current data suggests a higher-than-average risk profile.
