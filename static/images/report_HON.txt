## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Honeywell International Inc. (HON), a diversified technology and manufacturing company, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

HON's cumulative return (51.77%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.84%.  The difference is a substantial -70.1%, placing it at the lowest point (0.0% relative divergence) in the historical range of maximum (24.4%) and minimum (-70.1%) divergence.

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals mixed results. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of strong performance (e.g., 2017-2019, 2018-2020), recent years (2021-2025) indicate negative or low growth.  Alpha values generally positive indicate outperformance relative to the market, but the fluctuating alpha suggests inconsistent market-beating performance.  Beta consistently around 0.9 shows a high correlation with the overall market, meaning HON's price movements tend to track the S&P 500 closely.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 2.17 | $9.73 Billion |

Earnings show some fluctuation but generally remain relatively stable.  Revenue also shows modest fluctuation.  The duplicated entry needs correction.  Further analysis requires more complete historical data.

**5. Financial Information:**

No "Total Revenue" or "Gross Profit" data were provided. This significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  Further data is needed.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, showing a substantial negative divergence.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the extremely negative expected return forecast raises significant concerns.  The lack of complete financial data further hinders a thorough evaluation. The current situation warrants a cautious approach.  Before making any investment decisions, it is crucial to investigate the source of the -1601.1% expected return figure and obtain more comprehensive financial data to properly assess the company's financial health and future prospects.  A deeper dive into the company's strategic initiatives and market positioning is needed to fully understand the reasons for its underperformance.
