## Honeywell International Inc (HON) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Honeywell International Inc (HON), a Fortune 100 diversified technology and manufacturing company, based on provided financial data.  We will assess its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), analyze key financial metrics, and offer a concluding assessment.


**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

HON's cumulative return is 58.89%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's 112.87% cumulative return. The difference is -54.0%, placing it at the 17th percentile of its historical range (-70.1% to 24.4%).  This suggests HON has underperformed the broader market considerably over the measured period.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 41.0% | 1.5% | 13.0% | 0.3 | 82.7 |
| 2016-2018  | 17.0% | 8.5% | -2.0% | 0.1 | 75.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 39.0% | 8.5% | 8.0% | 0.7 | 103.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 34.0% | 16.5% | 7.0% | 0.8 | 127.6 |
| 2019-2021  | 38.0% | 16.5% | -33.0% | 0.8 | 127.2 |
| 2020-2022  | 19.0% | 16.5% | 10.0% | 0.8 | 133.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -3.0% | 11.1% | -26.0% | 0.9 | 133.4 |
| 2022-2024  | 7.0% | 11.1% | -25.0% | 0.9 | 146.8 |
| 2023-2025  | -3.0% | 7.1% | -57.0% | 0.9 | 138.0 |

The data shows inconsistent performance with fluctuating Alpha and a relatively stable Beta, suggesting some market sensitivity but also significant periods of underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The negative Alphas in recent years are particularly concerning.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $212.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $211.49
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $212.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $221.29

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $0.44 (from the previous close) is minimal in the context of the longer-term trend.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.3 –  Neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum.
* **PPO:** 0.34 –  A positive value indicates bullish momentum, though relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +10.4 – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -75.1% –  This strongly suggests significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term, based on the current data.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 2.17 | $9.73B        |

| 2024-10-24 | 2.29 | $9.21B        | *(Duplicate entry - likely a data error)*


EPS and revenue show some fluctuation but no clear upward or downward trend.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE     |
|---------|-----------|---------|

| 2024-03-31 | $16.45B  | 8.89%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $15.86B  | 7.97%  |

Equity is increasing, and ROE is generally strong, though it fluctuates somewhat.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, and projections suggest continued underperformance. While financial metrics like profit margins and ROE are generally healthy, the negative Alpha and the projected negative long-term return are concerning.  The recent price movement indicates a weakening trend.  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation is needed to identify the reasons for HON's underperformance and to assess the accuracy of the projected -75.1% return.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) also require attention and clarification.  A deeper dive into the company's specific business segments and industry factors impacting its performance is crucial.
