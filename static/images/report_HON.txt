Okay, here's a breakdown of the Honeywell International Inc. (HON) data provided, along with analysis and a summary:

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Honeywell International Inc. is a diversified technology and manufacturing company providing solutions to a wide range of industries.
*   **HON Cumulative Return:** 9.39%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.88%

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows fluctuating performance over the periods, with negative growth in recent periods.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha has been trending negatively, especially recently, implying Honeywell is underperforming relative to its benchmark. A significantly negative Alpha of -87% for 2023-2025 is very concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally around 1 or above, indicating Honeywell's price tends to move in the same direction as the market, and potentially with greater magnitude. The recent Beta of 2.0 (2023-2025) suggests increased sensitivity to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has fluctuated, suggesting changes in investor sentiment and company valuation.

*   **5-day SMA:** 198.56
*   **20-day SMA:** 193.45
*   **60-day SMA:** 200.20

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently slightly above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. However, it's still below the 60-day moving average, which could indicate some longer-term resistance. The recent change of 0.52 indicates a modest increase.

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 65.41
*   **PPO:** 0.67
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 5.2 (Positive - Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -557.8% (negative value is concerning)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A Medium Investment rating (0.7) indicates moderate risk/reward potential.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 65.41 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 0.67 suggests that the shorter-term moving average is slightly above the longer-term moving average.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** A positive recent divergence change supports the short-term upward trend indicated by the moving averages.
*   **Expected Return:** The massively negative expected return (-557.8%) is extremely concerning and indicates a very poor outlook for long-term investment in Honeywell compared to the S&P 500 based on this data.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   The news headlines are a mixed bag:
    *   **Positive Signals:** Analyst price target achievements, potential investment by representatives, and discussions of a $43B success.
    *   **Negative Signals:** TD Cowen reducing its price target, comparisons to competitors (3M), and reports focusing on after-hours activity which could point to volatility.

**Analysis:** The news flow is mixed. While there are some positive developments, the price target reductions and competitive analysis suggest some caution is warranted. The focus on after-hours trading could imply some instability.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~2.07)
*   **Target Price:** 237.40 (Average), 271.00 (High), 195.00 (Low)

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is generally positive (Buy rating) with an average price target significantly above the current price.  However, the wide range between the high and low price targets indicates considerable uncertainty among analysts. The lack of Recent Rating Changes data makes it difficult to assess the direction of analyst sentiment.
