* **20-day Moving Average:** $205.58
* **60-day Moving Average:** $210.79

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price increase of $2.67 (from $193.39) might be a temporary bounce.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period, and current indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook. While the company's financial statements display a healthy financial position,  the negative expected return and high market risk indicate caution.  The recent price increase should be viewed within the context of the overall downward trend and potentially is a temporary bounce.  Further analysis, including a longer time frame of data and consideration of external factors, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The -7.2% expected return against the S&P 500 suggests that even with a long-term investment strategy, outperformance is not currently predicted.
