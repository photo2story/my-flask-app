## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  Over the period analyzed, HON's cumulative return (66.34%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (122.16%). The difference is -55.8%, placing it in the 4.9th percentile of its historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-59.9% to 24.4%).  This indicates consistent underperformance against the market benchmark.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a relatively consistent Beta of around 0.4 across various periods, suggesting HON's price movements are less volatile than the overall market.  However, the Alpha values, while generally positive, are not exceptionally high, indicating limited outperformance relative to the market risk.  The negative Alpha in 2019-2021 and 2021-2023 highlights periods of significant underperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last data point, HON's closing price is $221.51.  The price shows a recent decline, with the following moving averages:

* 5-day moving average: $223.58
* 20-day moving average: $223.66
* 60-day moving average: $223.83

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The recent price change (-$1.84 or -0.82%) reinforces this.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (42.39):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce. However, it is not decisively oversold.
* **PPO (0.08):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, but it's very weak.
* **Relative Divergence:** The recent negative change in relative strength (-7.9%) confirms a short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return (-287.4%):**  This extraordinarily negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises significant concern.  This figure needs further clarification as it's highly improbable. It is likely an error in calculation or an extrapolation based on highly pessimistic assumptions.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While revenue generally remains stable above $9B, EPS fluctuates. There is no clear upward or downward trend visible from this limited data.  The repetition of the 2024-10-24 data point needs clarification.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HON's performance relative to the S&P 500 is significantly underwhelming, despite relatively stable financials.  The low Beta indicates lower volatility than the market, but the consistently low Alpha indicates limited outperformance.  Recent price action is bearish, supported by technical indicators.  The extremely negative expected return needs further investigation and clarification.  Before making any investment decisions, further due diligence is crucial, particularly concerning the highly improbable -287.4% expected return.  The company's fundamentals appear reasonably sound, but its market performance lags.  Consider a thorough review of the -287.4% expected return calculation.  Additional fundamental and technical analysis is needed before formulating a considered investment strategy.
