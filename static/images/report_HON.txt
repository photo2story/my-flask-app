**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Honeywell International Inc. (HON), a diversified technology and manufacturing company, based on provided financial data.  We will examine its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key indicators, earnings, and financial information.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Honeywell's cumulative return (68.00%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's cumulative return (119.91%). The difference is -51.9%, placing it at the 9.5th percentile of its historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (max: 24.4%, min: -59.9%).  This suggests HON has underperformed the market significantly over the measured period.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows varying performance across different periods, ranging from a high of 41% to a low of -3%.  The alpha values generally indicate that HON has outperformed the market in some periods but underperformed significantly in others, particularly recently. Beta consistently hovers around 0.9, suggesting high correlation with the overall market.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has steadily increased over the analyzed period.  The maximum drawdown (MDD) shows periods of significant risk, highlighting the volatility inherent in HON's stock price.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $223.72
* **Last Market Price:** $222.07 (a decrease of $1.65)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $223.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $222.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $225.32

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it's significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a more prolonged bearish trend.  The recent price drop of $1.65 is notable and contributes to the negative trend.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.24 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.11 (Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum, although relatively weak)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +4.6% (Indicates short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -140.9% (This indicates a significant expected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. This figure needs further clarification regarding its calculation methodology as it seems unusually high.)

The recent price drop reflected in the `Last-market` data contributes to the negative outlook for the short term.  The relatively low expected return, given the current circumstances and long term investment, suggests potential concerns over the stock's future performance.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Honeywell's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been significantly underwhelming, particularly over the past year. While financial indicators like profit margins and ROE appear healthy, the stock price displays a downward trend.  The technical indicators provide a mixed signal, with some suggesting short-term upward momentum but the longer-term picture remains bearish. The unusually low expected return (requiring clarification) further emphasizes the risk associated with this investment.  Further investigation is warranted to determine the reasons for the underperformance relative to the broader market,  paying attention to the validity of the data provided, particularly the significant negative long-term expected return and the duplicated earnings data.  Thorough due diligence is crucial before any investment decision.
