## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:** Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  While showing strong historical performance, recent performance lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting some signs of overvaluation and potential risk.  Further analysis is needed to determine its future prospects.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Honeywell (HON) has a cumulative return of 54.6%, compared to 87.9% for the S&P 500 (VOO). This represents a lag of -33.4%, placing it at the 16.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on provided min/max deviation).

* **20-day MA:** $203.58

The price is above all three moving averages, but the relatively small difference between the current price and the 5-day MA suggests limited near-term momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.17 (Overbought territory), indicating potential short-term overvaluation or a possible correction.
* **PPO:** 0.90, suggesting upward momentum, although the high RSI suggests caution.
* **Relative Strength:** A recent positive change in the 20-day relative strength (+0.5) suggests recent short-term upward movement.  However, this needs to be considered in light of the overall market performance and high RSI.
* **Expected Return:** -3.4%  The negative expected return highlights the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and warrants caution before investing. Long-term (2+ years) returns might improve, but currently the forecast is negative.  Note that a negative expected return should be carefully evaluated based on the investor's risk tolerance.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Honeywell exhibits a mixed performance picture.  While it demonstrates consistent profitability and strong historical returns in certain periods,  recent performance lags behind the market, showing negative CAGR, and its valuation appears somewhat high based on current indicators (RSI). The high Beta suggests significant market risk.  Before investing, a more in-depth analysis considering macroeconomic factors, industry trends, and a detailed competitive analysis is crucial. The negative expected return further highlights the risks involved.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before making any investment decisions.  Clarification on the duplicate entry in the earnings data is also necessary.
