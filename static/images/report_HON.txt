## Honeywell International Inc. (HON) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Honeywell International Inc. (HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company.  As of the latest data point, HON's cumulative return (70.58%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (122.19%). The difference is -51.6%, placing it at the 9.7th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates that HON has lagged behind the market benchmark considerably over the analyzed period.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows varying performance across different periods, ranging from a high of 41% to a low of -3%.  The relatively consistent beta of around 0.4 suggests lower volatility than the overall market (beta of 1).  However, the Alpha values indicate that HON hasn't consistently outperformed the market, with most values being slightly positive.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $226.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $227.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $228.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $215.23

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 44.57 - This suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory but is not definitively oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.42 - This indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -8.0 -  A negative divergence suggests a potential weakening of the upward trend (if any existed recently).
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% - The provided expected return of 0% implies no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term (2+ years) based on the current analysis.  Given the historical underperformance and current indicators, this is plausible.  A price of 226.4 doesn't indicate any significant rapid price movements (either up or down) based on the other indicators.

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally been stable around $9.5B with a slight upward trend, albeit some minor fluctuation between quarters.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown modest growth.  Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates, generally strong and around 8-9%, but also exhibits some variability across quarters.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires external data sources (news articles, financial news websites) to provide information on recent earnings news releases (within the last 2 days), the current market outlook, and analyst opinions.  I cannot access real-time information.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

HON has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While financial fundamentals like revenue and profit margins appear relatively strong, the recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, supported by negative technical indicators. The lack of consistent outperformance, as indicated by the Alpha values, coupled with the 0% expected return, suggests that HON's investment prospects relative to the S&P 500 need further investigation based on broader market analysis and external news.  The short-term trend is bearish, while the long-term picture requires more data and context.
