## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a Dutch company that manufactures lithography systems, crucial in the semiconductor industry.

The cumulative return of ASML is 251.75%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.73%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 131.02%.  The provided relative divergence of 36.4% indicates that ASML's performance is positioned relatively high within its historical range compared to the S&P 500, but this is not a direct measure of future outperformance.  The historical data shows periods of substantial outperformance and underperformance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high beta values (indicating high sensitivity to market movements) and consistently near-zero alpha (meaning little outperformance beyond what would be expected given its beta).  However, the significant cumulative return suggests market timing and sector-specific factors have played a crucial role in its overall performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $706.52
* **5-day Moving Average:** $712.996
* **20-day Moving Average:** $684.3165
* **60-day Moving Average:** $736.3503

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average and significantly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting potential short-term consolidation or a minor pullback from recent highs. The price is also below the 60-day moving average, implying a possible broader downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.82 -  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered >70), suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO:** 1.07 - Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.6 - Indicates a recent weakening in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 620% - This represents a significant outperformance expectation compared to the S&P 500.  However, this is a projection, not a guarantee, and depends heavily on various market factors and company performance. The current price of $706.49 does not indicate a significant recent surge or decline.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

ASML has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in the provided data.  While revenue figures are not directly available here, the consistently increasing EPS figures across quarters suggest positive revenue growth trends.  Notable beats occurred in each quarter, with the largest beat occurring in the quarter ending October 15th, 2024 (actual EPS: 5.74 vs. expected 5.29).


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally an upward trend.  Profit margins are consistently high and stable, hovering around 51%.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has seen substantial growth, and ROE (Return on Equity) displays some volatility, yet maintains a generally positive trend indicating strong profitability. The decrease in ROE in Q1 and Q2 2024 warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News:**  The provided earnings data constitutes the recent news.
* **Market Outlook & Analyst Opinions:**  This information is not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ASML has demonstrated exceptional long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, the recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction might be in order given the RSI and relative divergence indicators.  The consistently strong earnings and high profit margins support a positive long-term outlook, aligning with the high expected return.  However, it's crucial to acknowledge the high beta, indicating significant market sensitivity. The lack of current market outlook and analyst opinions limits a more comprehensive assessment.  Further investigation into the Q1 and Q2 2024 ROE decrease is recommended.
