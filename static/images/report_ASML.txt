ASML has historically demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by strong revenue and profitability. However, recent performance has weakened, indicated by negative CAGR values.  While the long-term outlook remains positive based on the high expected return, investors should carefully consider the high volatility (high MDD) and market sensitivity (high Beta) before investing.  Further analysis of the reasons behind the recent underperformance and future market trends in the semiconductor industry is critical for informed decision-making.  The strong financial fundamentals provide a foundation for future growth, but the recent downturn necessitates a cautious approach.
