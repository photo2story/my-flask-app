2025-01-26 - Analysis Report
Here's an analysis of ASML Holding NV ADR based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.

The cumulative return of ASML (262.40%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (52.12%). The difference is 210.3 percentage points.  The provided relative divergence of 31.4% indicates that ASML's performance relative to the S&P 500 is in the upper 31.4th percentile of its historical range (between a minimum divergence of 104.1 and a maximum of 442.7).  While this shows strong outperformance, it's crucial to remember this is a relative measure against historical performance and doesn't guarantee future returns.

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Alpha/Beta values show considerable volatility. High CAGRs in some periods are counterbalanced by negative CAGRs in others, demonstrating the risk associated with this stock.  The consistently high beta (around 1.0) indicates that ASML's price movements are highly correlated with the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $732.25
* **5-day Moving Average:** $752.91
* **20-day Moving Average:** $733.35
* **60-day Moving Average:** $705.46

The price is currently below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support.  The recent price change shows a decline (-$1.87).

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 57.84 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.002 – A slightly negative PPO suggests a weak bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.8% – This indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance.

The significant price change (-$1.87) coupled with the negative divergence suggests a short-term downward pressure.  However, the expected return of 521.8% over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500 shows high potential, but this should be viewed with caution given the volatility demonstrated in the CAGR data.  This high expected return should be considered in conjunction with the inherent risk, given ASML's beta of approximately 1.0.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ASML exhibits strong long-term growth potential, with significantly higher returns compared to the S&P 500.  However, it's a volatile stock with a high beta, meaning it's susceptible to market fluctuations.  The recent price decline and negative short-term indicators suggest caution in the immediate future.  The consistently strong earnings reports are a positive sign.  The high expected return should be considered in light of its volatility.  A long-term investment strategy with regular contributions may be appropriate for investors with a high risk tolerance.  Further analysis including examining the drivers of its revenue growth, competitive landscape, and potential future technological disruptions is crucial before making an investment decision.
