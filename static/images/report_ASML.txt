    *   Declining Alpha and high MDD indicate high risk and lower risk-adjusted returns recently.
    *   The 0.0% expected return is worrying and warrants further investigation.

**Conclusion:**

ASML appears to be at a crossroads. While its long-term prospects are generally positive due to its critical role in semiconductor manufacturing, several short-term factors are creating uncertainty. The high market risk indicator, the buy consensus, and the fact that ASML is approaching oversold territory could offer investors an oppurtunity to buy ASML. Investors should carefully weigh the potential impact of the China situation and monitor the company's financial performance closely. More information would be necessary to come to a conclusive decision.
