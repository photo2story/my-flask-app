## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.  Over the period analyzed, ASML significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The final cumulative return difference between ASML and VOO is 157.2 percentage points.  While the relative divergence (42.9%) indicates a strong outperformance compared to its historical range, it’s crucial to remember this is relative to the past performance and not a guarantee of future returns. The Alpha consistently remains negative, suggesting underperformance relative to the market after adjusting for beta. The high Beta (around 0.1 in the provided data) indicates high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures in several years are offset by a significant negative CAGR in 2022-2024.  This highlights the inherent risk associated with this stock.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $763.0
* **5-day Moving Average:** $746.44
* **20-day Moving Average:** $727.942
* **60-day Moving Average:** $703.479

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates less volatility in the recent past, compared to the larger difference with 20 and 60 days averages.  The positive change from the previous close ($0.88) also supports a positive short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 62.83 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.372 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.4 – Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 256.8% – This represents a significant potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming consistent investment. However, it's important to note this is an expectation, not a guarantee, and the actual returns will depend on various market factors. The recent price change of 0.88%  shows a minor uptick that might not indicate a sudden large movement.

Equity and ROE show similar patterns, with fluctuations between quarters.  Adding year-over-year growth calculations would provide a better understanding of trends.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ASML demonstrates strong financial performance with consistently high profit margins and revenue.  While the stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past,  the high beta and volatility highlight significant risk.  The consistently positive earnings surprises are encouraging, but it’s essential to consider the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and potential future market headwinds.  The projected long-term outperformance is promising but should be treated with caution given market uncertainty.  Further analysis incorporating more detailed financial ratios and macroeconomic factors is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The 2022-2024 negative CAGR is a critical factor demanding a thorough investigation into the underlying causes.
