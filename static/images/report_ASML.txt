* **5-day Moving Average:** $661.86
* **20-day Moving Average:** $670.57
* **60-day Moving Average:** $708.97

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The significant drop from the previous close (-7.06) indicates a recent sharp decline.

ASML has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but with considerable volatility. Recent price action indicates a short-term downtrend.

Long-term investors might consider the potentially high reward, but the considerable risk associated with ASML's volatility should be carefully considered.  Further research into the causes behind the recent price drop and an assessment of the long-term outlook for the semiconductor industry are essential before making any investment decisions.  The high expected return is based on historical performance and is not a guarantee of future results.
