ASML has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over several periods. However, recent data suggests a potential slowdown in growth, with negative CAGR and slightly declining EPS. While the high expected return is intriguing, it requires further investigation into the underlying assumptions. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with RSI nearing overbought territory.  A cautious approach is advised, considering the recent market downturn and high market sensitivity (beta) demonstrated by ASML.  Thorough due diligence and consideration of the inherent risks associated with this investment are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The substantial volatility observed warrants careful monitoring and a well-defined risk management strategy.
