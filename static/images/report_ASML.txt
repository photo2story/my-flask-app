ASML's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The provided data shows ASML with a cumulative return of 262.27% compared to VOO's 128.86%.  This represents a difference of 133.4 percentage points. The relative divergence of 34.7% indicates ASML's performance is in the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The historical Alpha consistently exceeds 1, demonstrating outperformance against the benchmark.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistent positive alpha, indicating ASML's outperformance relative to the market, although beta is consistently above 1, showing higher volatility than the market.  The higher alpha in recent years suggests increased outperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 670.48 (Last Market: 670.62)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 674.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 671.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 744.53

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend but still above the 20-day average, indicating some short-term support.  The significant difference between the 60-day and the current price suggests a potential recovery opportunity if the trend reverses.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (47.27):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, approaching neutral territory.
* **PPO (0.72):** A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum, although a relatively low value suggests this momentum is not particularly strong.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-3.6%):** Shows a recent slight decrease in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.  The negative value indicates recent underperformance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (719.4%):** This represents a significant potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance against the S&P 500 if a long-term investment strategy is adopted.  The figure requires further clarification on its calculation methodology. Given the current price is close to the 20-day average but below the 60-day average, we may not be witnessing a "급반등" or "급하락," but rather a period of consolidation.

Further analysis is needed based on missing data points, namely information on revenue growth, recent news, and a clearer explanation of the long-term expected return calculation.
