## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Investment Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a Dutch multinational company that manufactures lithography systems, crucial for semiconductor chip production.  The cumulative return of ASML is 274.31%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 118.37%. The difference is 155.9%, placing it in the 42.6th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates strong outperformance, but the relative percentile underscores the volatility of ASML's performance compared to the broader market.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different time periods.  While ASML consistently exhibits high CAGR, the MDD also indicates substantial risk.  The negative alpha consistently suggests underperformance relative to the market's risk-adjusted return, despite the high cumulative return.  The exceptionally high beta (around 302) highlights ASML's extreme sensitivity to market movements – significantly more volatile than the S&P 500.

* **20-day Moving Average:** $725.77
* **60-day Moving Average:** $702.75

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ASML demonstrates a compelling long-term growth story, driven by its dominant position in the semiconductor equipment market. However, the high volatility (reflected in the high beta and significant MDD) presents substantial risk. The consistently positive earnings surprises are encouraging.  The high expected return is promising but hinges on sustained performance in a highly cyclical industry.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in ASML.  A long-term, dollar-cost averaging approach may be advisable to mitigate the impact of significant price swings.
