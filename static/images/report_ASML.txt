**1) Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ASML's cumulative return (90.60%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (56.99%) by 33.6 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 19.2% indicates ASML's performance is in the upper percentiles compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance over different time periods.  While Alpha (market-beating return) is mostly positive, indicating outperformance,  Beta (market sensitivity) fluctuates. The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in some periods is offset by significant negative returns in others (e.g., 2022-2025). The market capitalization (Cap(B)) generally shows an increasing trend.  Noteworthy is the significant Maximum Drawdown (MDD) experienced during some periods, highlighting the risk associated with ASML's volatility.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

ASML's closing price is 615.77.  The recent price action shows a downward trend:

* **20-day Moving Average:** 690.89
* **60-day Moving Average:** 719.08

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend. The small positive change in the `Last-market` data (0.13) is not significant enough to indicate a reversal.

* **Recent Relative Divergence:** Positive (+4.3) suggests short-term upward pressure, but this needs confirmation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

ASML shows a history of strong performance relative to the S&P 500, although with significant volatility.  Current indicators (RSI, PPO, MRI) suggest a bearish short-term outlook, despite the relatively strong financial fundamentals. The projected long-term return is very high, but this should be considered alongside the inherent risk.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the sector outlook and macroeconomic factors, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The significant MDD shown in the Alpha/Beta analysis highlights the potential for substantial losses.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in ASML.
