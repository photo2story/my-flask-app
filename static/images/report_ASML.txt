ASML Holding NV ADR is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.  The cumulative return of ASML significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  While the 93% point difference is substantial, the relative outperformance rank of 29.7% suggests this level of outperformance is not unprecedented historically.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values over the years.  While the alpha is mostly positive indicating outperformance, it becomes significantly higher (0.9-1.0) in the more recent periods (2022-2025), suggesting increased market sensitivity.

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values in earlier periods reflect ASML's strong growth, while the recent negative CAGR suggests a period of underperformance.  Note the substantial Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) indicating significant risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ASML has historically demonstrated strong growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent data suggests a potential slowdown or correction.  The negative CAGR, declining moving averages, and bearish technical indicators (RSI, PPO) point towards a bearish short-term outlook.  The high expected long-term return is promising, but the substantial risk (indicated by high MDD values) should be considered.  Further investigation into the recent earnings and financial data is needed to understand the current state of the company and its prospects.  A thorough risk assessment is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The significant decline in the last market price warrants close monitoring of market conditions and news related to ASML.
