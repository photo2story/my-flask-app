**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a Dutch multinational company that manufactures lithography systems used in semiconductor manufacturing.  The cumulative return of ASML is 263.57%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 127.58%.

This indicates strong outperformance, but the relative percentile suggests periods of underperformance have occurred in the past.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high alpha values (ranging from 1.2 to 1.9), indicating significant outperformance compared to the market benchmark.  The beta values (ranging from 1.2 to 1.9) suggest a relatively high sensitivity to market fluctuations, with increasing beta in recent years suggesting amplified market risk.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has grown substantially over the period, reflecting the company's success.  Note that the negative CAGR in 2022-2024 should be viewed within the context of broader market trends.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 672.88
* **Last Market Price:** 673.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 666.17
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 675.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 753.32

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  The significant difference between the current price and the 60-day moving average indicates a more substantial price decline over the past two months.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 50.64 –  Near neutral territory, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.61 – Positive, indicating bullish momentum, though relatively weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -6.41 – Shows a recent decrease in relative strength versus the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 89.96% –  This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon assuming consistent past performance. However, this should be treated cautiously as past performance does not guarantee future results.  The 673.06 price doesn't suggest any significant rapid price movements (neither sharp uptrend nor downtrend).
