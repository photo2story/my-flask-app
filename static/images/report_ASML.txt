## ASML Holding NV ADR Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with considerably higher cumulative returns and volatility.  However, recent performance has been negative. Further analysis is required to determine the underlying reasons and future prospects.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** ASML (179.49%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (89.44%), resulting in a difference of 89.95%.  The relative divergence places its performance in the 90th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The alpha values show periods of both outperformance (positive alpha) and underperformance (negative alpha) relative to the market. The consistently high beta (above 0.9) indicates high sensitivity to market movements.  The significant swings in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlight the high volatility associated with ASML investments. The recent negative CAGR and increased MDD suggest the market is currently less favorable to ASML.

| 2015-2017  | 60.0% | 8.2% | 43.0% | -0.1 | 63.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 28.0% | 51.1% | 21.0% | -0.1 | 57.7 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $667.34
* **5-day Moving Average:** $680.19
* **20-day Moving Average:** $708.71
* **60-day Moving Average:** $726.93

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The small positive change in the last market day is insignificant in the context of the larger downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.94 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions, but this should be interpreted with caution in light of the other indicators.)
* **PPO:** -0.81 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 396.6% (This extremely high expected return should be treated with skepticism.  It likely reflects the inherent volatility and potential for significant upside based on historical performance; it is not a guaranteed outcome.)


The technical indicators generally point towards a bearish outlook. The small positive price change is not indicative of a significant reversal.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 예상 EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|----------|------------|
| 2025-01-29 | 7.3    | 7.41     | -0.11       |
| 2024-10-15 | 5.74   | 5.29     | +0.45       |
| 2024-07-17 | 4.01   | 3.73     | +0.28       |
| 2024-04-17 | 3.11   | 2.82     | +0.29       |
| 2024-01-24 | 5.2    | 4.77     | +0.43       |

In the last four quarters, ASML has consistently exceeded EPS expectations.  However, the most recent quarter shows a slight miss. The overall trend suggests strong profitability, but the recent miss warrants further investigation.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin | YoY Growth (Revenue) |
|---------|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.26B     | 51.71%        |                      |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.47B     | 50.80%        |                      |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.24B     | 51.45%        |                      |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.29B     | 50.98%        |                      |
| 2023-12-31 | $7.24B     | 51.37%        |                      |

Revenue shows a generally upward trend, but the recent quarter's high revenue needs to be examined with more detail. The profit margin has been relatively consistent and healthy, around 51%.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE         | YoY Growth (Equity)|
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $18.48B    | 14.58%      |                    |
| 2024-09-30 | $16.15B    | 12.86%      |                    |
| 2024-06-30 | $14.71B    | 10.73%      |                    |
| 2024-03-31 | $13.79B    | 8.87%       |                    |
| 2023-12-31 | $13.45B    | 15.22%      |                    |

Equity and ROE are both increasing, indicating strong financial health.  However, a more detailed year-over-year comparison would give a clearer picture of growth trends.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

ASML has historically demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent performance has been negative, and the technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook. While the company shows strong financial health with consistent profitability and increasing equity, the high volatility and recent market headwinds present a considerable risk.  The extremely high projected long-term return should be considered with extreme caution.  Further analysis, including a thorough examination of the recent earnings miss and broader macroeconomic factors, is essential before making any investment decisions.  The high beta suggests that ASML is highly sensitive to market changes; therefore any investment should be made with risk tolerance in mind.
