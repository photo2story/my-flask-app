*   **Analyst Target Price:** The average analyst target price is below the current price, indicating limited near-term upside.
*   **Recent Negative Returns**: The recent negative alpha and CAGR values from the Alpha, Beta analysis indicates that ASML has had a difficult time relative to market conditions

**Conclusion:**

ASML appears to be a good long-term investment, driven by the increasing demand for advanced semiconductors. However, given the overbought conditions and the recent earnings miss, it might be prudent to wait for a pullback before initiating or adding to a position.  Careful consideration should be given to the potential for short-term volatility and the sustainability of its high growth rate. The high "expected return" figure should be viewed with skepticism and validated with independent research.
