## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**

This report analyzes ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML), a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.  The analysis includes performance comparison against the S&P 500 (VOO), key financial metrics, and recent market trends.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **ASML Cumulative Return:** 96.86%
* **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 66.94%
* **Return Difference:** 29.92%  (ASML outperformed VOO by 29.92 percentage points).
* **Relative Outperformance:** 17.8% (This means ASML's outperformance is in the 87.8th percentile based on historical data ranges).

The provided CAGR data shows significant variability in ASML's performance across different periods.  While some periods exhibited extremely high growth (e.g., 244% CAGR from 2019-2021), more recent periods have shown substantial declines (-77% CAGR from 2023-2025). This highlights ASML's sensitivity to market cycles and the semiconductor industry's volatility. Alpha values fluctuate, suggesting inconsistent outperformance relative to the market, while Beta is generally high indicating high market sensitivity.

**2) Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $687.26
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $625.45
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $685.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $716.02

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it's below both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term pullback within a longer-term downward trend. The significant price increase from the previous close ($595.37 to $687.26) reflects a substantial, rapid rebound.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.85 (Slightly below neutral, suggesting potential for further downside, although not oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.7362 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.4 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** 510.4% (This implies a significant potential for outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), but  is likely an extremely optimistic prediction given recent performance volatility.)

The conflicting signals from the indicators – high risk, negative PPO, but a recent upward movement and a high expected return – highlight the uncertainty surrounding ASML's short-term prospects.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

ASML has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the long term. However, recent price action and mixed signals from technical indicators suggest near-term uncertainty. While the company's financial health appears strong, with high profit margins and increasing equity, the volatility in recent earnings and the high sensitivity to market cycles (high beta) necessitate caution.  The extremely high projected long-term return should be treated with skepticism.  Further due diligence, including analysis of the broader semiconductor market and ASML's specific competitive landscape, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current high risk indicator should also be carefully considered.
