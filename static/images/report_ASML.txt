This report analyzes ASML Holding NV ADR, a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

ASML's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 282.21% for ASML versus 130.81% for VOO.  This represents a difference of 151.4 percentage points.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, is 38.9% based on the provided range (max: 414.5, min: -15.9).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for ASML over various periods, ranging from 42% to 379%. However, Beta values are high indicating significant correlation with market movements and also high volatility (MDD - Maximum Drawdown). The Alpha values of 0.0 suggest the outperformance isn't consistently above market expectations.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 62.0% | 2.4% | 0.0 | 64.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 42.0% | 8.1% | 0.0 | 58.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 116.0% | 9.1% | 0.0 | 111.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 171.0% | 9.1% | 0.0 | 185.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 379.0% | 10.4% | 0.0 | 304.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 114.0% | 17.2% | 0.0 | 211.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 46.0% | 17.2% | 0.0 | 295.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 711.5
* **5-day Moving Average:** 709.512
* **20-day Moving Average:** 680.8755
* **60-day Moving Average:** 739.6379

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, above the 20-day moving average, and below the 60-day moving average. This suggests some short-term momentum but a potential pullback given the longer-term averages.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 56.37 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.35 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** nan (-) suggesting recent downward pressure.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 640.4% (This is a high expectation compared to historical data,  requires further scrutiny of the methodology).  The provided 640.4% figure likely represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.  However, high uncertainty accompanies such long-term projections.  The closing price of 711.64 doesn't suggest a significant immediate price event (no evidence of a sharp jump or fall).

**6. News and Recent Issues:**  This section requires information on recent news articles, market outlooks, and analyst opinions.  I cannot access real-time information, including news.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ASML shows strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent earnings have consistently beaten expectations, and the company maintains high profit margins.  However, the high Beta suggests significant market risk, and the very high projected long-term return needs further justification and should be viewed with caution.  Further analysis incorporating recent news, market sentiment, and a detailed examination of the 640.4% expected return calculation is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility (MDD) observed in the past should be factored into any investment strategy.
