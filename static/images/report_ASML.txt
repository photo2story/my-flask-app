## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.

The cumulative return of ASML since the beginning of the period is 251.28%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.71%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 134.57%.  The relative outperformance is at the 37.3rd percentile based on the historical range of its outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While historically strong,  this does not guarantee future performance.

The provided alpha consistently shows negative values (-0.1), indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark after accounting for beta.  However, the high beta values (ranging from 58 to 113) suggest ASML's returns are significantly more volatile than the market.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values over most periods demonstrate strong past growth, yet the recent period (2022-2024) shows a sharp decline of -68%, highlighting the risk associated with its high volatility.
