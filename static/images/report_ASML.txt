**7. Overall Summary**

ASML exhibits strong underlying financial performance, demonstrated by its revenue growth, high profit margins, and positive earnings surprises.

Investors should closely monitor upcoming news and analyst reports, particularly regarding the factors driving the negative expected return. The strong financial performance may eventually outweigh these concerns, but further data is needed for a more confident bullish outlook.
