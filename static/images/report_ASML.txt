*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth rate over each period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. High MDD values indicate significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the stock's performance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500), adjusted for risk (Beta).  Positive Alpha indicates outperformance, while negative Alpha indicates underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A Beta of 1 means the stock moves in line with the market. A Beta greater than 1 means the stock is more volatile than the market, and less than 1 means it is less volatile.
*   **Cap(B):** Represents the market capitalization in billions.

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta Table:**

*   **Volatility:** ASML generally exhibits high volatility, as indicated by the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values.
*   **Beta:** ASML has a Beta consistently above 1, meaning it's generally more volatile than the S&P 500.  The Beta has been trending upwards in more recent periods, suggesting increasing volatility relative to the market.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is highly variable, reflecting periods of both significant outperformance (2017-2019, 2019-2021) and significant underperformance (2022-2024, 2023-2025).  The recent negative Alpha values are concerning.
*   **Capitalization:** Market capitalization has generally increased over time, indicating growth in company value, but has recently shown more volatility and a fluctuating capitalization.

*   **PPO:** -0.26

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI indicates that the model suggests it's a good time to invest (based on its risk assessment).
*   **RSI:** The RSI indicates the stock is nearing oversold territory, which *could* suggest a potential buying opportunity. However, it's not a guarantee.
*   **PPO:** The PPO being negative suggests a downtrend, but the value is small.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This is a model-generated recommendation. Given the MRI, it suggests investing a large portion (or all) of available cash.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The short-term rise in relative divergence suggests some recent positive momentum *compared* to the comparison stock.
*   **Expected Return:** The 0.0% expected return is concerning. It suggests the model does not anticipate significant outperformance of the market over the next two years from the current valuation.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Catalysts:** Multiple articles highlight positive catalysts for ASML, including AI demand driving growth in semiconductor equipment, and ASML being identified as a top pick for 2026. The article mentioning "ASML stock soars 50%" is important, but its dated to the end of the year, which will make it more important to determine if that gain was actually sustained.
