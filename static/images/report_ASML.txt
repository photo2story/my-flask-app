**Analysis of Alpha and Beta Table:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate fluctuates significantly. Recent periods (2021-2025) show weaker performance compared to earlier periods (2015-2021).  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a small positive return.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is high across all periods, consistently above 65% and mostly in the 70-80% range, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the stock's performance relative to the benchmark.  Early periods had strong positive Alpha, indicating outperformance. More recent periods (2021-2025) show negative Alpha, indicating underperformance compared to the benchmark. This is a major concern.
*   **Beta:**  Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market.  Beta values have been largely around 1, or even negative for certain periods (2016-2020). A beta near 1 means ASML's price tends to move similarly to the overall market.  Periods with negative Beta indicate price movements against the market.  This implies more risk of the stock.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization has increased significantly over the years, reflecting ASML's growth as a company, albeit recent stagnation in the share price (reflected by the last 3 years).

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 966.57
*   **Previous Close:** 981.04
*   **Change:** -1.47
*   **5-day SMA:** 1002.2
*   **20-day SMA:** 1033.25
*   **60-day SMA:** 962.63

**Analysis:** The stock price has decreased slightly since the previous close. The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are above the current price, indicating a recent downward trend. The 60-day SMA is below the current price, suggesting a possible support level.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Market Risk Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 32.32
*   **PPO:** -1.06
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Sell 79.5% of holdings (198 shares) - Risky - MRI:0.50 (Cash Ratio: 79% on 2025-10-16)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.2 (+) 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 86.4%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is below 30, indicating that the stock may be oversold and potentially poised for a rebound.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, suggesting a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends selling a significant portion of holdings (79.5%), indicating a bearish outlook in the short term, driven by risk considerations (MRI: 0.50).
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a potential short-term upward movement, contradicting some of the other signals.
*   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return (86.4%) suggests potential for long-term growth if the investment is held for more than 2 years. This contradicts most of the information from the recent metrics.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive:** The articles discussing ASML's strong shareholder returns and sector momentum, AlphaCore Capital's increased holdings, and potential future growth (Where Will ASML Stock Be in 1 Year?) paint a generally positive long-term picture. The "ASML Holding Soars 45% YTD" article is a backward looking piece, but highlights the growth momentum of the company.
*   **Neutral/Mixed:**  The "Is ASML Stock a Buy?" article from Motley Fool suggests further research is needed, indicating a balanced perspective.
*   **Negative:** The article about European stocks set to drop following Wall Street reversal indicates a potential negative impact from macroeconomic factors.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** The analyst consensus is "Buy," with a mean rating of 1.74 (leaning toward Buy).
*   **Target Price:** The average target price of $1016.53 suggests a potential upside from the current price.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

ASML is a fundamentally strong company in the semiconductor industry, which is confirmed by the analyst consensus and long-term growth potential indicated by the expected return and positive news articles. However, recent performance has lagged the S&P 500, and the stock exhibits high volatility. The RSI suggests it might be oversold, but the PPO and hybrid signal point to a continued downtrend in the short term. The mixed signals necessitate caution, and the "Sell" recommendation from the hybrid signal suggests reducing exposure in the short term.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Short-term:** Given the bearish short-term indicators (PPO, hybrid signal) and the recent price decline, it may be prudent to reduce exposure or consider a wait-and-see approach.
*   **Long-term:** If the very high expected return (%) is accurate, and you have a high risk tolerance, a small position might be warranted. However, carefully consider the divergence data, analyst opinions, company news, and overall market conditions before making any investment decisions.

**Important Considerations:**

*   The high volatility (MDD) makes ASML a risky investment.
*   The accuracy of the "Expected Return" of 86.4% should be carefully validated, as it seems contradictory to other indicators. This might be overly optimistic.
*   The recent change in relative divergence suggests a possible short-term rally, but this should be confirmed with additional technical analysis.
*   Monitor news and analyst ratings closely for any changes in sentiment.
