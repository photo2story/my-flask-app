## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.  The stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing higher cumulative returns but also higher volatility. Recent performance shows a decline, warranting further investigation into underlying market factors.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ASML's cumulative return (93.49%) substantially exceeded the S&P 500's return (76.19%) by 17.3 percentage points.  The relative outperformance (13.0% based on historical range) suggests a generally strong performance compared to the broader market, though this is subject to significant volatility as indicated by the large range of historical relative outperformance (max: 244.6%, min: -16.6%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals varying levels of outperformance (Alpha) and market sensitivity (Beta) across different periods.  High Alphas (e.g., 1.4 in 2017-2019, 0.7 in 2018-2020) indicate superior returns compared to the market, while Beta values consistently exceed 1, demonstrating higher volatility than the S&P 500. The recent negative CAGR (-89% in 2023-2025) and significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight the risk associated with ASML's high-growth, high-volatility profile.  The large market capitalization (Cap(B)) suggests this is a large, established company.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

ASML's recent earnings show a mixed picture. While EPS has generally been above expectations, there's a clear deceleration in growth momentum in the latest quarters (Q1 and Q2 2024).

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ASML has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting high growth and significant volatility.  However, recent performance shows a decline, with negative CAGR and considerable MDD. While financials demonstrate strong profitability and healthy equity, the recent slowdown in earnings growth and the discrepancies between the reported performance and the extraordinarily high projected return raise concerns.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent decline and a more realistic assessment of future performance are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The extremely high projected return should be critically examined and validated.  The high Beta suggests investors should be comfortable with significant market risk.
