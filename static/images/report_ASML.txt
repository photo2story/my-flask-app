## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.  The cumulative return of ASML is 265.74%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.20%. The difference in cumulative return is 153.5%.  This places ASML's relative outperformance at the 42nd percentile based on historical data, indicating substantial outperformance but not necessarily an extreme outlier compared to its historical volatility.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows ASML consistently exhibiting high growth (CAGR), but also significant maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The negative alpha suggests that after accounting for market risk (beta), ASML's returns have underperformed the market in some periods. However, the exceptionally high beta values reflect ASML's sensitivity to market movements. The high beta values indicate ASML's performance is significantly influenced by overall market trends, especially positive ones. The massive growth periods outweigh the negative alpha, resulting in large cumulative gains.  Note that the recent negative CAGR values indicate a recent downturn, and the -0.1 alpha might not be indicative of the overall long-term picture.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ASML shows a history of strong performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the long term.  While recent quarters have shown some slowdown, the company's financials remain robust, with high profit margins and consistent revenue growth.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity, meaning investors should consider their overall risk tolerance.  The positive PPO and relatively healthy RSI suggest potential for further growth.  However, the high MDD figures from the alpha/beta analysis caution against solely focusing on the impressive long-term CAGR and highlight the volatile nature of this investment.  The projected long-term return should be considered within the context of this volatility.
