## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), ASML has significantly outperformed. The cumulative return difference on the last day of the provided data is 159.1 percentage points (275.51% - 116.43% = 159.08%).  The relative divergence indicates that ASML's performance has been considerably higher than VOO's over the observed period, placing it in the upper 43.4% percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO.  However, this historical outperformance doesn't guarantee future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures for ASML, especially between 2017 and 2021.

The extremely high Beta values further highlight the high risk associated with this stock. The significant drop in CAGR from 2022-2024 indicates considerable market sensitivity.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ASML exhibits strong financial performance with high revenue, profit margins, and generally positive ROE.  However, the high beta highlights significant market risk.  While past performance relative to the S&P 500 has been exceptional, the projected 252% long-term return is ambitious and should not be considered a guaranteed outcome.  Further due diligence, including analyzing the reasons for the 2022-2024 CAGR drop and the ROE fluctuation, is essential before making any investment decisions. The consistently negative alpha indicates that despite its outperformance compared to the S&P 500, it has underperformed relative to its risk.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in ASML.
