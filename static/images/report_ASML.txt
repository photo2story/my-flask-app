## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Investment Review

This report analyzes ASML Holding NV ADR, a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.


**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

ASML's cumulative return (270.98%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (130.06%).  The difference is 140.9 percentage points. This places ASML at the 36.4th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided data.  While this indicates strong outperformance, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The provided alpha values of 0.0 across all periods suggest that the outperformance may be largely explained by market factors (high beta).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 686.61 (Last Market: 706.88) indicating a recent downturn.
* **5-day Moving Average:** 677.28
* **20-day Moving Average:** 672.02
* **60-day Moving Average:** 742.75

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average highlights the recent price decline.  The closing price being below the last market price of 706.88 further confirms the recent negative price movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 56.51 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, although closer to neutral than overbought.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.835 – A positive value indicates bullish momentum, though the magnitude is relatively modest.
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** NaN (-) indicating a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 685.6 (This number needs clarification. Is this a percentage return or a price target?  The context is insufficient to interpret this meaningfully).  A 685.6% return over a 2+ year period is exceptionally high and unlikely.  The provided data lacks enough information to make a solid forecast, especially given the significant fluctuations observed in the CAGR values.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company consistently beat EPS expectations in every quarter presented.  While EPS fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, there is an overall upward trend.  No revenue data is presented, making it impossible to analyze revenue growth trends.

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|--------|---------------|------------|
| 2024-10-15 | 5.74   | 5.29          | Beat       |
| 2024-07-17 | 4.36   | 4.06          | Beat       |
| 2024-04-17 | 3.31   | 3             | Beat       |
| 2024-01-24 | 5.64   | 5.18          | Beat       |

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally demonstrates growth. Profit margins are consistently high and relatively stable, hovering around 51%. Equity shows growth, although ROE fluctuates indicating some variability in profitability.  2023 Q4 shows a significant jump in ROE, likely related to an increase in profit relative to equity.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent market outlook information is provided.  Analyst opinions are not included, preventing a complete assessment.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ASML has demonstrated exceptional historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, largely driven by a high beta.  However, recent price action shows a downtrend, though the RSI and PPO suggest neither overbought nor oversold conditions.  Consistent EPS beats are positive, although revenue trends remain unknown. The provided "expected return" figure is unclear and requires more context.  Missing news and analyst data limit the scope of this comprehensive analysis.  More information is needed for a more thorough evaluation.  The high volatility observed in the CAGR and the high beta emphasize the high-risk nature of this investment.
