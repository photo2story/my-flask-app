## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Stock Review

**1. Relative Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

ASML has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  The cumulative return for ASML is 265.96% compared to 120.85% for the S&P 500, resulting in a difference of 145.11 percentage points.

**Company Overview:** ASML Holding NV ADR is a leading provider of photolithography systems for the semiconductor industry.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  While ASML has demonstrated impressive CAGR figures over various periods, the consistent negative Beta (-0.1) is unusual and warrants further investigation.  It suggests that ASML's price has historically moved inversely to the market, which is counterintuitive for a company in a cyclical industry. The high Alpha values indicate significant outperformance beyond what the Beta would predict. This data needs careful scrutiny for accuracy.
