**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values over the years. While some years show positive alpha (outperformance), others show negative alpha or alpha near zero. Beta consistently hovers around 1.0 indicating high volatility and correlation with the overall market.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) demonstrates substantial growth over the period.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in several periods reflects strong growth but is tempered by substantial maximum drawdown (MDD) in recent years. This highlights the significant risk associated with ASML's performance, despite its large market cap.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price is below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The price is also slightly below the 20-day moving average, further supporting this. The 5-day moving average is considerably lower than both the 20- and 60-day averages, indicating recent downward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk) suggests a moderate level of risk.
* **RSI:** 57.82 indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral momentum.
* **PPO:** 0.5577, a positive value, suggests bullish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +1.8 indicates short-term upward momentum.  The lack of "None" data indicates no significant sudden price shifts (like a flash crash).
* **Expected Return:** A projected 770.1% long-term excess return over the S&P 500 is a very high expectation, warranting caution and further investigation of underlying assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings per share (EPS) have shown a mixed trend, with some quarters exceeding expectations and others falling short.  The data shows a decrease in EPS in recent quarters.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons for this trend.

| 날짜       | EPS  | 예상 EPS | Difference |
|------------|------|----------|------------|
| 2025-04-16 | 6.31 | 6.12      | +0.19       |

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing data is a significant drawback to this report and needs to be addressed for a complete picture of ASML's financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ASML has shown strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but recent data suggests a potential slowdown. While the long-term expected return is substantial, the high volatility (indicated by beta and MDD) and the absence of key financial data warrant caution.  The relatively high RSI and positive PPO suggest bullish momentum, but the downward trend in recent price movement and EPS needs closer scrutiny. The missing financial data significantly hampers a complete assessment.  Further investigation is required into the drivers of recent performance, the sustainability of future growth, and a thorough review of the financial statements is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high expected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism until further corroborating data is obtained.
