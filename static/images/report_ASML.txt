**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ASML has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The cumulative return of ASML is 265.84%, while VOO's is 119.91%.  This represents a difference of 145.9 percentage points, placing it at the 40.1 percentile of its historical performance range against the S&P 500 (based on a historical range of -15.2% to 386.8%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high growth and high beta (market sensitivity).  While Alpha fluctuates, often being positive, indicating outperformance,  the high beta suggests considerable market risk.  The substantial CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures across the analyzed periods reflect ASML's strong growth trajectory, but the recent negative CAGR highlights the vulnerability to market downturns.  High MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values also emphasize the substantial risk associated with ASML's investment.

While the long-term outlook remains positive,  investors should be aware of the inherent volatility.
