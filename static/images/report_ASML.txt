## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Stock Report

This report analyzes ASML Holding NV ADR, a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ASML's cumulative return of 93.36% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 65.78% over the measured period.  The difference is 27.6%, placing it at the 16.9th percentile of the historical range (max: 242.9%, min: -16.3%). This suggests a relatively strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but not exceptionally so considering its historical volatility.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta). While Alpha (excess return relative to the market) was positive in several periods, suggesting outperformance,  it also shows periods of negative Alpha and significant volatility in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown). The high CAGR values in some periods are offset by significant negative returns in others. Market cap shows consistent growth over the analyzed period.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

ASML has historically shown strong performance relative to the S&P 500, although recent performance has been more volatile.  Strong revenue and profitability are positive indicators.  However, the significant recent price drop, mixed technical indicators, and the exceptionally high projected future return warrant caution. The  high expected return and lack of explanation for that projection necessitates a deep dive into the valuation methodology before any investment decision is made.  Further investigation into the recent price decline and a more detailed analysis of the provided data, including underlying market conditions and sector-specific factors, are crucial before drawing definitive conclusions.
