*   **Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:**
    *   **CAGR:** Fluctuates wildly, reflecting the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. High growth periods are followed by periods of decline or stagnation.
    *   **MDD:** Consistently high, indicating significant drawdowns (losses) are common. This confirms the high volatility associated with ASML.
    *   **Alpha:**  Indicates ASML's performance relative to its benchmark. Positive alpha means it outperformed; negative means it underperformed. Notice the recent negative alphas from 2021 onwards.
    *   **Beta:** Generally close to 1 or even exceeds it, meaning ASML's price tends to move in the same direction and roughly the same magnitude as the market (or even more). The recent betas suggest ASML is slightly more volatile than the market. Negative beta values for 2016-2020 indicate inverse market correlation.
    *   **Cap(B):** Shows market capitalization changes, indicating the company's growth (with some fluctuations).
