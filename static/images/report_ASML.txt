## ASML Holding NV ADR Stock Report

**0) Overview:**

ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

ASML's cumulative return of 89.78% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 72.42% over the analyzed period.  The difference is 17.4%, placing it at the 13th percentile of its historical range (max 244.4%, min -16.6%).  This suggests strong relative performance, though the relative percentile indicates this outperformance isn't consistently extreme.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different time periods.  While there are periods of significant alpha (outperformance), indicating ASML's ability to generate returns independent of the market, there are also periods with negative or low alpha. Beta consistently sits above 0.0, implying higher volatility compared to the overall market. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has shown significant growth. The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in some periods reflects the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and ASML's position within it. Note the dramatic decline in CAGR in the 2022-2025 projection.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

ASML has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downturn.  The projected decline in CAGR and the variability in earnings and ROE highlights the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the inherent risk in ASML's business. While the long-term outlook driven by the expected return of 743.4% seems highly optimistic, it's crucial to examine the methodology and assumptions behind this projection for validation.  A more conservative approach would be recommended, considering the current market conditions and potential for industry volatility.  Further research into the drivers behind the expected return and the projected earnings decline in 2025 is needed for a more complete assessment.  The current price action warrants caution, and investors should closely monitor developments in the semiconductor market and ASML's business.
