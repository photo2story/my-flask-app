## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.  The analysis below shows ASML significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the evaluated period, but recently experienced a price decline, warranting further investigation.  While the long-term outlook remains positive,  recent performance indicators suggest caution.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ASML's cumulative return (243.27%) dramatically surpasses the S&P 500's (112.87%). The difference (130.4%) is high relative to its historical range (-15.2% to 386.8%), placing it at the 36.2nd percentile.  This signifies strong outperformance, but within the context of its past volatility.

The provided alpha/beta data reveals varying performance across different periods.  While high alpha values (e.g., 0.7 in 2017-2019, 1.0 in 2021-2023) suggest periods of substantial outperformance, recent negative CAGR (-74% in 2022-2024 and -35% in 2023-2025) indicate a significant downturn.  The high beta consistently above 50 indicates considerable market sensitivity.
