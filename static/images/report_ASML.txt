## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.  The cumulative return for ASML is 255.21%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.39%. The difference in returns is 136.8%, placing it in the 37.8th percentile of its historical range of outperformance against the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -15.2% and a maximum of 386.8%).  The provided alpha consistently shows negative values, indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark adjusted for its beta. However, the high cumulative return showcases strong absolute performance despite this relative underperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistently negative alpha across the observed periods, ranging from -0.1 to -0.1. This suggests that ASML has underperformed the market (S&P 500) after adjusting for its beta. However, the high beta values (ranging from 58 to 112) indicate that ASML's returns are significantly more volatile than the market. The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values, especially in 2019-2021 (353%), demonstrate strong absolute growth despite the relative underperformance suggested by the alpha. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) shows significant drawdowns in some periods, underscoring the risk associated with ASML.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**  (Information not provided in the prompt.  This section requires current news and analyst reports to be completed.)


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ASML exhibits a strong track record of substantial returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this outperformance is coupled with high volatility, as reflected in the high beta and notable maximum drawdowns. While the recent price movement is relatively stable, and EPS consistently beats expectations, the long-term expected return is highly optimistic and requires further validation.  The financial statements reveal strong profitability and revenue growth trends, with high profit margins and positive ROE, though some recent quarterly variability should be investigated. Further research is needed concerning recent news and analyst opinions to provide a comprehensive investment recommendation.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return should be treated with extreme caution.
