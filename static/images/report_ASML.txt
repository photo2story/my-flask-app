| 2022-2024  | -74.0% | 19.0% | -107.0% | 1.0 | 272.5 | Beta near 1; significant underperformance.                |

The high Alpha values in several periods indicate significant outperformance relative to the market benchmark. However, recent periods show a decline in performance and a beta closer to 1, suggesting stronger correlation with overall market trends.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 732.22
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 718.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 734.68
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 728.99

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting potential short-term downward pressure.  The price is above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a stronger longer-term trend.  The recent price increase of 2.43 from the previous close suggests a short-term positive movement, but not a significant rapid surge.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.95 (Slightly below 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.20 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength:** 4.2 (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 275.9% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is projected)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO indicate potential for further price correction, despite the positive short-term relative strength. The high expected return, however, suggests long-term potential if the market outperformance trend continues.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

ASML demonstrates a strong long-term growth trajectory, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over several periods.  However, recent performance has been less impressive, and technical indicators suggest potential for short-term correction. Despite this, the high expected return and consistently strong financial performance suggest that ASML remains a potentially attractive investment for long-term investors who are comfortable with moderate risk.  Further analysis incorporating year-over-year growth comparisons for revenue and equity would enhance the insights.  Additionally,  a deeper dive into the reasons behind the recent underperformance would be beneficial.
