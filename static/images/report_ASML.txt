## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures at a Glance:**

* **Cumulative Return (ASML):** 99.47%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 78.93%
* **Return Difference:** 20.54%
* **Relative Divergence:** 14.2% (Indicates ASML's performance is above the S&P 500, within the historical context of its divergence)


**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.  ASML significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, exhibiting a 20.54% higher cumulative return.  While the relative divergence of 14.2% suggests above-average performance compared to its historical volatility against the S&P 500,  it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Alpha/Beta data show volatile yet strong performance over different time periods. The high alpha values in some years (e.g., 2017-2019, 2018-2020) suggest outperformance relative to the market, potentially driven by strong industry demand and ASML's market position.  The negative CAGRs in recent years (2022-2025) are noteworthy and warrant further investigation into the underlying market conditions.  The high Beta values in the later years (2021-2025) highlight the stock's increased sensitivity to overall market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $657.98
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $639.29
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $653.40
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $702.74

The recent price is slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a relatively neutral short-term trend. However, it's significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend in the medium term.  The price increase from the previous close ($638.69 to $657.98) reflects a 3.02% jump, which is noteworthy.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 48.47 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.24 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, although relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 667.9% (This exceptionally high figure needs further clarification on its calculation and underlying assumptions.  A 667.9% return is highly improbable and requires significant context and justification).


The recent price jump (3.02%) needs further investigation to understand the underlying catalysts.  The MRI suggests a medium risk profile. The RSI and PPO indicators point to a neutral to slightly positive short-term outlook but do not support the extremely high predicted long-term return.

Revenue and profitability have fluctuated, showing some decline in recent quarters (2025-03-31 shows a significant decline in revenue). The ROE (Return on Equity) has also shown some variability, reflecting the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ASML has demonstrated strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, driven by its position in a key technology sector.  However, recent data reveals some concerns: declining revenue and profit in recent quarters, high Beta values indicative of market sensitivity, and a substantially lower-than-expected long-term return.  The recent price jump needs further investigation to ascertain its sustainability.  Further analysis considering macroeconomic factors, industry trends, and a more conservative projection of future returns is necessary before making any investment decisions. The exceptionally high expected return needs critical evaluation and robust justification.  A thorough due diligence process is recommended before investing in ASML.
