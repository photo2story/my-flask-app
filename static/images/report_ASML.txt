2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) based on the data provided, along with my interpretation:

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO) & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **ASML Overview:** ASML is a leading provider of lithography systems for the semiconductor industry.
*   **Return Comparison:**
    *   ASML Cumulative Return: 80.97%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 105.07%
    *   Divergence: -24.1 (Relative Divergence: 21.6)

*   **Analysis:** ASML has underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. The divergence of -24.1% indicates a significant difference in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 21.6 suggests that ASML's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is currently near the lower end of its historical fluctuation range.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**
    *   The data shows that ASML's Alpha and Beta values fluctuate significantly over different periods.
    *   **Alpha:** The alpha is high in the periods of 2017-2021, indicating strong outperformance during those periods. More recently, the alpha turned negative suggesting underperformance relative to its expected return based on market movements.
    *   **Beta:** The beta generally stays above 1, indicating ASML is more volatile than the market. Beta has been trending upwards in recent periods, implying increased sensitivity to market movements.
    *   **CAGR:** The CAGR has fallen dramatically in the most recent period.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) remains consistently high, indicating significant downside risk.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 1069.86
*   **Recent Movement:** -0.21 from previous close of 1072.14
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 1069.25
    *   20-day SMA: 1082.07
    *   60-day SMA: 1044.22

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is slightly down recently. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which *could* be interpreted as a short-term bearish signal. However, the 60-day SMA is significantly lower than both, suggesting a possible longer-term upward trend that has recently stalled.

**3) Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 37.47
*   **PPO:** -0.26
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (160 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 1.6 (+)
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** Despite recent underperformance, the MRI suggests the stock is a good investment from a risk perspective (0.9 indicates "High Investment Recommended").
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 37.47 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), which could indicate a potential buying opportunity.
    *   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests the stock is trending slightly downward.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends buying all available cash based on its risk model.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence indicates a short-term upward trend.
    *   **Expected Return:** A 0.0% expected return over 2 years is concerning and suggests no anticipated outperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Cantor Fitzgerald Increased Price Target:** Positive news regarding increased AI outlook.
*   **Motley Fool Article: Is ASML a Buy?** This suggests ongoing debate about ASML's valuation and future prospects.
*   **Morningstar Article: ASML's Moat Intact:** Positive news suggesting ASML's competitive advantage remains strong.
*   **Ninety One UK Ltd Selling Shares:** Potentially negative news indicating a major shareholder is reducing their position, although the amount sold (4,235 shares) may not be significant.
*   **China's Domestic Equipment Rule:** This introduces uncertainty and potential risk due to geopolitical factors and potential impact on ASML's market access.
*   **Potential Stock Split:** Positive speculation but no concrete announcement.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean = 1.70)
*   **Target Price:** Average target price near current level, suggesting modest upside.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Information missing about recent rating changes, so difficult to incorporate.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

ASML is a leading company in a critical industry, but the data presents a mixed picture.

*   **Strengths:** Strong competitive position (wide moat), positive analyst consensus (Buy), potentially oversold RSI, and positive sentiment from some analyst reports.

*   **Weaknesses/Risks:** Recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high volatility (Beta), high maximum drawdown, significant capital at risk, and geopolitical risks related to China.  The 0.0% expected return suggests there is concern about future performance.

*   **Overall:** The market risk indicator (MRI) and the hybrid signal indicate that ASML is a viable investment at its current price (from a risk point of view). However, the investor should be aware of potential risks. Although the analyst rating and price target are positive, the price does not seem to be able to go up easily and shows volatility. Overall, it is recommended to proceed with caution after a detailed and thorough analysis.
