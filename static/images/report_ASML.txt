While this indicates strong outperformance, it's crucial to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ASML demonstrates strong financial performance with consistently high profit margins and exceeding earnings expectations.  Its long-term growth potential is significant, as evidenced by the high expected return. However, the high beta highlights significant risk associated with its price volatility.  The recent slight price dip might present a buying opportunity for long-term investors, however further market research and risk assessment is advisable.  The negative alpha suggests the market might be overvaluing ASML given its high beta, but also note that the calculation's time horizon is long.  Considering the company's position in the crucial semiconductor industry and its consistent outperformance (relative to the S&P 500), ASML remains an attractive investment for those with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon.
