## ASML Holding NV ADR (ASML) Stock Review

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

ASML Holding NV ADR is a Dutch multinational manufacturer of lithography systems used in semiconductor manufacturing.  The cumulative return of ASML over the analyzed period is 262.4%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 122.2%. The difference is 140.2%, placing it at the 38.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a min/max range).  This indicates that while ASML has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, its current outperformance relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500 is closer to the middle than the extreme high end.

The provided alpha consistently shows negative values (-0.1).  While seemingly negative, this should be interpreted cautiously without further context, as a negative alpha implies underperformance relative to a benchmark adjusted for beta. The Beta values are consistently high, showcasing ASML's significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  However, its high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values over various periods highlight substantial growth potential, especially noteworthy in the 2019-2021 period with a CAGR of 353%.  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values highlight significant risk. The recent period shows particularly high negative CAGR values suggesting recent market downturn has affected ASML more significantly than the benchmark.  Market cap has generally shown a growth trend throughout the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $732.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $752.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $733.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $705.46

The closing price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term upward trend.  The recent price drop of approximately $14 from the previous close (-1.87%) signifies a short-term negative change.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.84 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.002 (Slightly negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -3.6% (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 303.2% (Significant outperformance of S&P 500 expected over the long term)

The relatively low PPO and negative relative strength change suggest some bearish momentum in the short term. However, the RSI is not deeply in oversold territory. The significant positive expected return highlights the potential for long-term growth, but it's crucial to remember that this is a projection and not a guarantee. The large price drop from the previous close should be considered as a possible catalyst for a period of consolidation or short-term downward price movement.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

ASML has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.  This positive trend points towards strong financial performance and positive market sentiment.  While the EPS numbers demonstrate an overall upward trend, there is a noticeable variance in the data which requires further investigation into possible underlying factors influencing revenue and profitability.  The data provided only indicates quarterly results, rather than full-year, which is useful context to incorporate if available.


| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|-------------|------------|
| 2024-10-15 | 5.74   | 5.29        | 0.45       |
| 2024-07-17 | 4.36   | 4.06        | 0.30       |
| 2024-04-17 | 3.31   | 3.00        | 0.31       |
| 2024-01-24 | 5.64   | 5.18        | 0.46       |
| 2023-10-18 | 5.10   | 4.86        | 0.24       |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability show a healthy and relatively stable performance with high profit margins consistently around 50%.  ROE (Return on Equity) is also generally high, indicating efficient use of shareholder capital. However, there's a noticeable drop in ROE from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 and further into Q2 2024, suggesting a potential short-term slowdown, before seeming to rebound somewhat in Q3 2024.  This could be investigated further.  More granular data, such as detailed cost breakdowns, could provide a better understanding of these fluctuations.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ASML shows a strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  However, recent price movements indicate a short-term bearish trend.  While the company demonstrates consistently high profitability and exceeding earnings expectations, the recent relative weakening and the high beta should be considered.  The high expected return suggests significant long-term growth potential for investors with a long-term horizon who can weather short-term market fluctuations. Further investigation into the recent dip in ROE and the fluctuations in profitability will be needed for a more comprehensive analysis.
