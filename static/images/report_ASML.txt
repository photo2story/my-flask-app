**6. Overall Conclusion:**

ASML has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.

The lack of key financial data, however, presents a significant limitation to a fully informed assessment.  Further investigation into financial statements and market conditions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high Beta also suggests a higher level of risk compared to a broad market index like the S&P 500.
