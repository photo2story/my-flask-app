**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistently negative alpha (-0.1) across all periods, suggesting that ASML has underperformed the market (S&P500) after accounting for its risk (beta). However,  the high beta values (ranging from 59 to 114) indicate that ASML's price movements are significantly more volatile than the S&P 500.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in several periods highlights substantial growth despite the negative alpha. This suggests a strong performance despite market fluctuations. It's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ASML exhibits strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While the negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to its risk, the consistently high CAGR and strong revenue/profitability figures demonstrate substantial growth.  Recent earnings have exceeded expectations, and technical indicators point to a potentially bullish outlook, though the price is currently slightly below its short-term moving average.  The high beta indicates significant volatility, which investors should consider.  The projected long-term outperformance against the S&P 500 warrants further investigation but should be viewed cautiously, as past performance does not guarantee future results.  Thorough due diligence, including consideration of market conditions and sector trends, is essential before making any investment decisions.
