## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Boeing Co (BA), a leading aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling airplanes and defense products, significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for BA is -11.32%, while the VOO's is 120.40%. This represents a substantial divergence of -131.7%, placing it at the 4.4th percentile of the historical range (-143.8% to 133.2%).

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in BA's performance across different periods, with some years exceeding 100% returns and others experiencing substantial losses exceeding 120%.  The high volatility is reflected in the substantial Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures.  Despite consistent Beta of around 0.2 suggesting relatively low correlation with the overall market, the Alpha is significantly negative during the loss years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $164.10 (Last Market: $165.86)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $158.00
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $150.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.37

The stock price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it remains below its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend. The last market price of $165.86 is only marginally above the closing price and doesn't suggest a significant sudden price change (neither a sharp rebound nor a sharp decline).

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 72.95 –  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO:** 0.96 – Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Relative Strength:** The recent 20-day relative divergence increase of +1.9 points to short-term upward movement.

The expected return is 0.0%, which represents the expected excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) based on current data. This suggests that while there might be short-term opportunities, there is no strong indication of significant outperformance of the S&P 500 in the long run based solely on provided data.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals some inconsistencies: The October 29th, 2024 entry appears twice with identical figures.  Disregarding the duplicate, we can observe:

* **Quarterly Revenue:** Revenue has been relatively stable, fluctuating around $25 billion. There's no clear upward or downward trend discernible from this limited data set.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS has shown some fluctuation, ranging from $0.77 to $0.91 over the reported quarters. There is no obvious trend.
* **Comparison to Expectations:** No information on expected earnings is provided to assess "beats" or "misses."

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Significant quarter-to-quarter volatility in both revenue and profit margin is observed.  A large negative profit margin (-19.66%) is present in Q3 2024, contrasting with positive margins in other quarters.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Negative equity is present across all reported quarters. ROE is highly volatile, ranging from a negative value (-17.23%) to a high of 26.20%.  This points to significant financial risks and instability in the company's financial structure.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last 2 days) earnings news or analyst opinions are provided.  The market outlook and any current major issues influencing Boeing are not included in the provided data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance significantly lags the S&P 500.  While short-term indicators show some positive momentum (above 5 and 20-day moving averages, positive PPO), the long-term outlook is uncertain, considering the substantial underperformance, high volatility,  negative alpha in several years, and erratic financial health reflected in negative equity and volatile profit margins. The highly volatile nature of both the stock price and financial metrics suggests high risk.  The absence of recent news and detailed market analysis further limits a comprehensive assessment.  More data and context, particularly regarding analyst expectations and current market conditions, are needed for a thorough evaluation.  The 0.0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 indicates no clear long-term advantage over passive market investment, given the available information.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.
