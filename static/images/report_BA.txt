**7. 종합적인 분석:**

**Overall Assessment:**

Boeing (BA) presents a mixed picture. While recent price action and MRI indicate short-term potential, several factors raise serious concerns:

*   **Significant Underperformance:** BA has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500. The Alpha, Beta table showed continuous deterioration.
*   **Financial Weakness:** Negative equity, volatile profit margins, and ROE suggest financial instability.
*   **Overbought RSI:** Suggests a potential pullback in the near term.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Hybrid signal suggests caution.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The very negative expected return makes Boeing stock an extremely risky for long-term investing.
*   **News Sensitivity:** The stock appears highly sensitive to news and events.

**Recommendation:**

Given the negative expected return, and BA's financial information showed deterioration, it is recommended to avoid long-term investment. Short-term trading might be possible given that recent price action showed positive movement, but high risk and sensitivity to the news should be considered.
