## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Boeing Co (BA) based on the provided data, incorporating financial statements, technical indicators, and recent news.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Boeing Co is an American multinational aerospace and defense corporation, designing, manufacturing, and selling airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide.

The cumulative return for BA is -13.82%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 128.31%.  The divergence is -142.1%, placing it at the 2.5th percentile of its historical range (-149.4% to 146.6%).  This indicates substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided CAGR data shows periods of strong performance interspersed with significant declines, highlighting the volatility inherent in this stock.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $153.1 (Last market: $151.8)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $147.5
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $148.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $153.09

The price is currently slightly above the 60-day moving average, suggesting potential support, but below both the 5 and 20-day moving averages, indicating short-term downward pressure.  The difference between the last market price ($151.8) and the closing price ($153.1) suggests a slight upward bounce, not a significant surge.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.49 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.54 (Positive, indicating potential bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This needs further clarification and analysis.  A 0% expected return is unrealistic without considering factors like risk-adjusted return and market conditions. The provided information lacks the detail required to form an accurate long-term expectation against S&P 500.)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO suggests bullish momentum and the relative divergence shows a short-term upward trend, the RSI is near neutral, and the overall performance against the S&P 500 is significantly negative.  A more detailed analysis considering risk-adjusted returns is necessary for a proper projection.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue.  While the latest earnings report (Oct 29, 2024) shows a slight decrease in revenue compared to the previous quarter,  it remains relatively stable within the context of the last year's data.  To accurately assess the performance, a comparison with analyst expectations for the period is needed.  Missing this crucial information prevents comprehensive analysis.


**6. Financial Information:**

The quarterly financial data reveals significant volatility in profitability and equity.  The large negative equity values in several quarters are concerning.  The fluctuating profit margins and ROE suggest challenges in consistent profitability. The substantial loss in the September 2024 quarter warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.  A more detailed analysis involving key financial ratios (like debt-to-equity, current ratio) would provide a more comprehensive view of the company's financial health.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires access to real-time news sources like Shacknews and Finbold to provide analysis on recent earnings announcements, market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.  Please provide links to relevant articles for a complete analysis.)*

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the provided period. While some short-term technical indicators suggest potential upward momentum, the substantial underperformance against the market, negative cumulative returns, and volatile financial results raise concerns.  The lack of analyst expectations and deeper financial ratio analysis limits the depth of this assessment. Further investigation into the causes of recent losses and a thorough review of the company's long-term strategy are necessary before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The 0% expected return provided requires substantial revision based on a more thorough risk-adjusted analysis.

**9.  Recommendations:**

Based on the available data, a cautious approach is warranted.  Given the significant underperformance relative to the market and the volatile financial results, further investigation is crucial before considering any significant investment in BA.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the financial fluctuations and a careful comparison with industry peers are essential for making an informed decision.  Access to updated news and analyst reports would significantly enhance the accuracy of this analysis.
