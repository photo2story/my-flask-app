Despite the recent positive earnings report, Boeing has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly in the long term.

However, it's important to note that the stock's future performance is heavily dependent on various factors like industry trends, competition, and overall economic conditions.

**Conclusion:**

While Boeing's recent earnings performance is positive, the stock's overall performance is currently lagging behind the market. The technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downtrend, but the oversold RSI offers a potential opportunity for a rebound. Long-term investors may find the stock's high expected return attractive, but it's crucial to consider the inherent risks associated with the aerospace industry and Boeing's current financial situation.
