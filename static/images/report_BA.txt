**0. Executive Summary:**

Boeing Co. (BA) is a major aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling airplanes and defense systems.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $155.52
* **Previous Close:** $159.28
* **Change:** -$2.36 (a -1.48% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $157.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $163.95
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $170.05

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price drop of $2.36 could be considered a moderate daily decline.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.77 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions)

* **Expected Return (%):** -681.2% (Significantly negative, suggesting substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term)

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence strongly suggests bearish momentum.  The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag for long-term investment.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue         |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| 2024-10-29 | $0.82 | $25.34 Billion |
| 2024-07-30 | $0.83 | $25.38 Billion |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.77 | $25.82 Billion |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.91 | $25.17 Billion |
| 2024-10-29 | $0.91 | $25.17 Billion | *(Duplicate entry - likely a data error)*

Revenue has remained relatively stable around $25 Billion in recent quarters, but EPS is showing some volatility.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.



**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24 Billion | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84 Billion | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87 Billion | 7.29%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57 Billion | 11.32%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02 Billion | 12.25%        |

Profit margins are highly volatile, showing both significant losses and gains across the quarters.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity        | ROE           |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | -$3.91 Billion | 98.90%        |
| 2024-09-30 | -$23.55 Billion| 26.20%        |
| 2024-06-30 | -$17.98 Billion| 8.01%         |
| 2024-03-31 | -$17.01 Billion| 2.02%         |
| 2023-12-31 | -$17.23 Billion| 0.13%         |

Negative equity across all reported quarters is a major concern, indicating the company may have more liabilities than assets.  The ROE is also highly volatile and doesn't provide a clear picture of profitability given the negative equity.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance is currently weak, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  Technical indicators point to bearish momentum in the short term.  The company faces serious financial challenges, evidenced by negative equity and highly volatile profitability.  The extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 strongly suggests against a long-term investment in BA at this time unless there's a significant improvement in financial health and market sentiment.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative equity and volatile profitability is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated data entry in the earnings report requires clarification.
