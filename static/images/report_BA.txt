The negative alpha values, the high MDD, and the concerning expected return all point to substantial risks. The news snippets suggest ongoing challenges and scrutiny. While the MRI indicates "Low Risk," this should be interpreted cautiously given the other indicators. The technical indicators show "overbought" and the negative change in relative divergence suggests the underperformance compared to the S&P 500 has worsened recently.
The recent earnings and financial data shows Revenue fluctuations. The negative equity is concerning.
