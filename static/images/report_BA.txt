2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the Boeing (BA) stock information provided, combining the raw data with simple analysis:

**1) Return Rate Comparison: Boeing vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Boeing Co Overview:** A leading global aerospace company specializing in commercial airplanes, defense, space, and security systems.
*   **Boeing Cumulative Return:** 4.95%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 91.00%
*   **Divergence:** -86.1 (Relative Divergence: 9.6)

    *   **Analysis:** Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period measured. The divergence of -86.1 highlights this large difference in returns. The relative divergence of 9.6 suggests that compared to its historical fluctuations, this underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range.

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth rate over the period.  The periods from 2018 onwards show significant declines.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. The MDD is quite high in recent years, indicating significant volatility and potential losses.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the stock's performance relative to a benchmark (presumably the market).  Negative alpha indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark. Boeing has consistently shown negative Alpha in recent periods.
*   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A beta above 1 indicates that the stock is more volatile than the market. Boeing's Beta is consistently above 1.0.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in billions.

    *   **Analysis:** The table reveals a history of strong performance in the earlier years (2016-2019), followed by significant struggles from 2018 onwards. The negative CAGR, large MDD, and negative Alpha in recent periods demonstrate considerable underperformance and risk. While the Beta has fluctuated, it remains consistently above 1.0, indicating Boeing is more volatile than the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 227.77
*   **Previous Close:** 217.12
*   **Change:** 4.91
*   **5-day SMA:** 219.416
*   **20-day SMA:** 210.2015
*   **60-day SMA:** 204.9933

    *   **Analysis:** The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA, further supporting this short-term bullish trend. The significant positive change of 4.91 suggests strong recent positive movement.

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 89.77
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.6878
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** 3.5 (+) (단기상승 - short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -409.0

    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests moderate risk.
        *   **RSI:** The RSI is very high (above 70, often considered overbought). An RSI of 89.77 suggests that the stock may be overbought and a correction is possible.
        *   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests a short-term bullish trend.
        *   **Hybrid Signal:** Recommends buying, further indicating a potentially positive outlook (though tempered by the MRI).
        *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** Confirms recent upward momentum.
        *   **Expected Return:** A very negative expected return (-409.0%) is a major red flag. It suggests that, based on the current data and analysis, long-term investment in Boeing from this point is projected to result in significant losses compared to the S&P 500.

*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 245.76 / 285.00 / 150.00

    *   **Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating with a target price of $245.76. This indicates they believe the stock has upside potential. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices (285.00 and 150.00) shows significant disagreement among analysts and a high degree of uncertainty.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출     |
|------------|-------|----------|
| 2025-10-31 | 1.08  | 28.09 B$ |
| 2025-07-31 | 0.9   | 26.46 B$ |
| 2025-04-30 | 0.91  | 27.37 B$ |
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82  | 25.34 B$ |
| 2025-10-31 | 0.82  | 25.34 B$ |

    *   **Analysis:** The earnings per share (EPS) and revenue figures show a generally positive trend in recent quarters. However, there appears to be a duplicate entry for 2025-10-31 with conflicting EPS (1.08 vs. 0.82) and Revenue (28.09 vs 25.34) data, which would require clarification or correction.

**6) Financial Information:**

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $23.27B    | -10.21%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $22.75B    | 10.70%         |
| 2025-03-31 | $19.50B    | 12.40%         |

| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B    | -19.66%        |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE       |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $-8.25B    | 64.69%    |
| 2025-06-30 | $-3.29B    | 18.54%    |
| 2025-03-31 | $-3.33B    | 1.11%     |
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B    | 98.90%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B   | 26.20%    |

    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue generally increased in the past four quarters, although profitability is inconsistent. Negative profit margins in some quarters raise concerns.
        *   **Capital and Profitability:** Boeing has negative equity, which is a serious concern. While the Return on Equity (ROE) figures are high, they are based on a negative equity base, making them less meaningful and potentially misleading. High ROE with negative equity is generally considered unsustainable.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Underperformance:** Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Recent price action shows short-term upward momentum, and analyst ratings are generally positive. However, the RSI indicates the stock might be overbought.
*   **Financial Concerns:**  Negative equity and inconsistent profitability are significant red flags. The very negative expected return is also a major concern.
*   **News Impact:** News headlines are mixed, with some pointing to positive future prospects while others highlight specific deals.
*   **Overall:** Based on the data provided, there are significant concerns about Boeing's financial health and long-term prospects. While short-term momentum might be positive, the underlying financials and the projected negative return suggest caution. The analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy" rating, but the wide range of target prices reflects uncertainty.

**In conclusion, a careful evaluation of Boeing is warranted, considering the financial risks and the uncertainty surrounding its future performance. Further due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.**
