**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Boeing Co. (BA) is a major aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling commercial jetliners, defense products, and space systems.  BA's cumulative return of -26.65% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's 85.44% return over the analyzed period. The substantial difference (-112.1%) highlights significant underperformance.  The relative divergence of 6.6% indicates this underperformance is relatively less extreme compared to the historical range of divergence between BA and VOO, but still considerably negative.

The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance.  While periods of strong growth exist (e.g., 2015-2017, 2016-2018), substantial negative returns are also present (2018-2021), indicating significant volatility and risk. The negative alpha in several periods suggests underperformance relative to the market benchmark after adjusting for risk (beta).  Market capitalization also fluctuates significantly.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 90.0% | 16.9% | 72.0% | 0.3 | 211.5 |
| 2016-2018  | 93.0% | 48.0% | 86.0% | 0.2 | 235.8 |
| 2017-2019  | 47.0% | 48.0% | 27.0% | 0.1 | 243.7 |
| 2018-2020  | -116.0% | 48.0% | -150.0% | -0.3 | 161.1 |
| 2019-2021  | -111.0% | 44.9% | -184.0% | -0.3 | 151.5 |
| 2020-2022  | -62.0% | 44.9% | -73.0% | -0.5 | 143.3 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of BA is $150.91, significantly below its 5-day ($166.30), 20-day ($166.80), and 60-day ($172.67) moving averages. This indicates a bearish trend. The price has decreased by $10.47 (-6.2%) compared to the previous close, suggesting a recent price drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 40.08 suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce. However, the negative PPO (-0.69) confirms bearish momentum. The recent relative divergence change of -3.1% points to short-term downward pressure.  The large negative price change ($-10.47) reflects a significant recent drop. Given the substantial negative expected return of -834.5%, a long-term (2+ years) investment in BA is highly risky and unlikely to outperform the S&P 500.  The negative expected return likely reflects the current market sentiment and forecast.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue. While revenue generally remains stable around $25 Billion, EPS exhibits some volatility. There's a notable drop in EPS from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024.  Further analysis would require understanding the reasons behind these fluctuations.

| 날짜       | EPS | 매출       |
|------------|-----|------------|
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | 25.34 B$   |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.83 | 25.38 B$   |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.77 | 25.82 B$   |
| 2023-10-31 | 0.91 | 25.17 B$   |
| 2024-10-29 | 0.91 | 25.17 B$   |  *(Duplicate entry - likely a data error)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals significant concerns. Negative equity in several quarters is a major red flag, indicating the company may have more liabilities than assets.  Profit margins are highly volatile, swinging between significant losses and modest profits.  The high ROE figures during quarters with negative equity are misleading and should be interpreted with caution, possibly reflecting accounting effects rather than true profitability.

| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B   | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B   | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B   | 7.29%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B   | 11.32%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B   | 12.25%        |

| Quarter     | Equity    | ROE          |
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B   | 98.90%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B  | 26.20%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B  | 8.01%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B  | 2.02%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B  | 0.13%        |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Boeing's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the broader market (S&P 500).  The company faces challenges reflected in its negative profit margins, volatile earnings, and negative equity. While the RSI suggests potential short-term price recovery, the negative PPO and large negative expected return strongly suggest a bearish outlook.  The inconsistent performance history and significant financial weaknesses make BA a high-risk investment at the present time.  A long-term investment strategy requires careful consideration of these significant risks and a thorough understanding of the factors driving the company's performance.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for the negative profit margins and fluctuating EPS is crucial before any investment decision.
