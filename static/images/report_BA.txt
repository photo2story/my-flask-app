Okay, here's a comprehensive report on Boeing (BA) based on the data provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison: Boeing (BA) vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Boeing Co. is a leading global aerospace manufacturer and service provider.
*   **Boeing Cumulative Return:** 4.95%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 91.00%
*   **Divergence:** -91.3 (Relative Divergence: 7.1)

**Analysis:** Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The large negative divergence (-91.3) indicates a substantial gap between Boeing's returns and the overall market's returns.

| 2023-2025  | -8.0%  | 42.7%  | -70.0%   | 1.1  | 170.0  |

Boeing's negative Alpha values in recent periods indicate it has been significantly underperforming its expected return based on its beta (market sensitivity). While the beta values suggest that Boeing's stock price is more volatile than the market (beta > 1), it is still significantly underperforming.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 227.77
*   **Previous Close:** 217.12
*   **Change:** 4.91
*   **5-day SMA:** 219.42
*   **20-day SMA:** 210.20
*   **60-day SMA:** 204.99

**Analysis:**  Boeing's stock has recently experienced a significant upward price movement, as indicated by the positive change and the current close being higher than all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA, signaling a short-term bullish trend. The large price change (4.91) from the previous close reflects high recent volatility.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 89.77 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.6878
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.9 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -573.0 (Negative expected excess return)

**Analysis:** The RSI value of 89.77 suggests that Boeing is currently overbought, which could indicate a potential pullback or consolidation in the near term. The MRI indicates a medium investment risk level. The Hybrid Signal suggests buying shares as it is considered very safe with MRI:0.9. However, the most concerning indicator is the extremely negative expected return of -573.0%. This suggests a very pessimistic outlook for Boeing's long-term performance relative to the S&P 500, despite recent short term increase.

*   **Positive Sentiment:**  Multiple articles highlighting potential gains (Barron's: 25% gain), outperformance (Yahoo Finance), and price increases (MarketBeat). JP Morgan also increased the price target.

*   **Target Price:** 245.76 (Avg), 285.00 (High), 150.00 (Low)

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue has generally increased over the past year, with the latest quarter showing the highest revenue.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are volatile, with negative margins in some quarters and positive margins in others. The negative profit margin in the most recent quarter (2025-09-30) is concerning.
*   **Equity:** Boeing's equity is negative, indicating that its liabilities exceed its assets. This is a significant financial risk.
*   **ROE:** ROE is highly variable and often driven by the negative equity, making it difficult to interpret. The high ROE values are likely not sustainable given the negative equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Boeing presents a mixed picture.

*   **Underperformance:**  It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the past several years. The negative alpha reflects its failure to deliver expected returns based on its market volatility.
*   **Recent Positive Momentum:** The stock has experienced a recent price surge, driven by positive news and analyst upgrades.
*   **Overbought Condition:**  The RSI indicates an overbought condition, suggesting a potential pullback.
*   **Financial Risks:** The negative equity and volatile profit margins are significant financial risks that need to be considered.

**Overall Conclusion:**

While Boeing shows signs of recent positive momentum, the underlying financial risks and long-term underperformance compared to the market raise concerns. The extremely negative expected return should give investors pause. Investors should carefully weigh the potential upside from recent positive news and analyst sentiment against the significant financial risks before making an investment decision. Further research into the causes of the negative equity and the volatility in profit margins is warranted.
