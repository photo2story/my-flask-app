*   Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial negative divergence. The Relative Divergence of 0.0 suggests it is currently at the lowest end of its historical performance range relative to the index.
*   Alpha is largely negative, indicating underperformance relative to the risk-free rate and benchmark. Beta has increased substantially in recent years, suggesting increasing volatility relative to the market.
*   CAGR and MDD have deteriorated significantly in recent years, reflecting operational challenges and market volatility.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement:**

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 226.52
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 225.35

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. The 5-day moving average is slightly below the current price, which could indicate some short-term support. The small change from the previous close doesn't signal a major immediate event, but needs to be considered in conjunction with other factors.

*   **Recent (20-Day) Relative Divergence Change:** -3.1 (Negative - indicating a short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -7232.4%

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI indicates an oversold condition, which could suggest a potential for a short-term bounce.
*   The negative PPO reinforces the downward trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a defensive strategy, advocating for a high cash position and a slight reduction in holdings.
*   The MRI at 0.434 indicates medium risk.
*   The significantly negative expected return suggests that, based on the model, long-term investment from the current point may substantially underperform the S&P 500.
*   The negative change in relative divergence indicates a worsening of Boeing's performance relative to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **BAE Systems Launch:** BAE Systems-built components successfully launched. (Neutral to slightly positive, tangential)

*   **Industry Report:** Mention in France Aviation Industry Research Report. (Neutral)

**Analysis:**

*   The news flow is mixed. The FAA fine being deemed insufficient is a concerning headline. The landing gear deal and Palantir software integration are positive developments, but their financial impact is likely limited.

*   **Opinions:** 23
*   **Target Price:** Average: 253.70, High: 287.00, Low: 150.00

**Analysis:**

*   Analysts have a consensus "Buy" rating with an average target price significantly above the current price, suggesting potential upside. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates considerable uncertainty.  The absence of recent rating changes suggests no immediate shifts in analyst sentiment.

**7. Overall Assessment:**

Boeing faces a challenging situation. While analyst consensus is positive, the company is currently underperforming significantly relative to the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, potentially leading to a short-term rebound. However, the significantly negative expected return and medium market risk indicate caution. News is mixed, with regulatory scrutiny remaining a headwind. Financially, revenue and profit margins have shown recent improvement, but negative equity remains a concern.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the provided information, a **cautious approach** is warranted. The oversold condition and positive analyst ratings suggest a potential for a short-term trade, but the fundamental challenges and negative long-term outlook require careful consideration. It's crucial to closely monitor news flow, earnings reports, and any changes in analyst sentiment. A long-term investment may not be appropriate at this time. The high cash position suggested by the Hybrid signal is a prudent strategy.
