**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Boeing Co (BA) is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide.

The cumulative return of BA is -9.69%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 112.74%.  This represents a significant underperformance of BA relative to the market. The provided data shows a considerable divergence, with BA lagging behind VOO by 122.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -7.8% indicates that BA's performance is in the lower percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), MDD (Maximum Drawdown), Alpha, and Beta values across different time periods.  While Alpha is consistently around 0.2, indicating some degree of outperformance, the highly variable CAGR and significant negative values (especially in 2018-2021) highlight the risk associated with BA. Beta, also relatively consistent at around 0.2, suggests that BA's price movements are less volatile than the overall market.  However, the large negative CAGRs outweigh this.  Market capitalization also fluctuates, reflecting the company's financial performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $167.02
* **5-day Moving Average:** $170.77
* **20-day Moving Average:** $174.05

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 28.18 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.01 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.1 – This shows a short-term upward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** -747.8% – This extremely negative expected return is concerning and requires further investigation.  The data indicates a significant potential for continued underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years).  The significant negative value needs clarification as it seems unrealistic.  It could be an error in calculation or might reflect a very pessimistic scenario.

The financial data reveals significant volatility in profitability and a consistently negative equity position. The large negative equity in the most recent quarter is a major red flag and requires further investigation into the company's balance sheet.  The fluctuating profit margins further highlight the instability of Boeing's financial performance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, showing considerable underperformance.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but negative momentum prevails. Recent earnings show some fluctuation, and financial statements highlight serious concerns regarding negative equity and volatile profitability. The extremely negative expected return (-747.8%) is highly suspect and necessitates clarification. Before considering any investment, thorough due diligence is required to understand the underlying causes of the financial instability and the unexpectedly low expected return.  The large negative equity and fluctuating profitability raise serious concerns about the long-term viability of the company.  Given the current information, further research and clarification are crucial before making any investment decisions.
