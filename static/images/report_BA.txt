**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha values in recent periods (2018-2025) indicate that Boeing has been underperforming its benchmark even when accounting for market risk.  This suggests fundamental issues beyond general market movements.
*   **Beta:** Negative beta values suggest an inverse relationship with the market. In theory, it could act as a hedge, but given the negative alpha and large MDD, it has performed poorly.
*   **CAGR & MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures coupled with periods of negative Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) highlight the significant volatility and risk associated with investing in Boeing during the specified timeframes. The more recent years (2018 onwards) are especially concerning due to the large negative values.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated, reflecting investor sentiment and company performance.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movements

**Key Numbers:**

*   **Current Price:** 232.28
*   **Last Market Close:** Price: 232.22, Previous Close: 237.38, Change: -2.17

*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 221.81

**Analysis:**

The current price is slightly below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. The recent price decrease (-2.17 from the previous close) suggests a short-term downward trend. The last-market data indicates a noticeable price decline, signaling potential immediate concerns or reactions to news.

### 3. Technical Indicators

**Key Numbers:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.34 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 49.56
*   **PPO:** 0.05
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (4 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-02)
*   **20-Day Relative Deviation Change:** -0.8 (Negative - Short-Term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -1646.9%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A low MRI of 0.34 suggests that the market perceives relatively low risk currently, but this might be misleading given the company-specific challenges.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 49.56 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO (0.05) suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, typically indicating a potential upward trend, albeit a weak one.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The 'cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash' signal with a 'Caution' warning and 0% cash ratio indicates that there's a mixed view – an encouragement to buy a significant portion, yet with strong reservation due to the overall uncertainty.
*   **20-Day Relative Deviation Change:** The negative change of -0.8 confirms a short-term downward trend relative to the comparison stock.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-1646.9%) is a huge red flag. It suggests that, based on the model, the stock is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term, even with dollar-cost averaging.

Based on the provided data, Boeing (BA) presents a **high-risk investment** with several red flags:

*   **Significant Underperformance:**  It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), and the negative alpha values indicate it's not just due to general market conditions.
*   **Financial Instability:** Negative equity values and fluctuating profit margins raise concerns about the company's financial health and long-term sustainability.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return suggests a high likelihood of continued underperformance.
*   **Recent Volatility:** Recent news and events contribute to the stock's volatility.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal suggesting 'Caution' is a clear indication that even algorithmic analysis has some concern.

**Recommendation:**

Given the financial concerns and negative indicators, a **strong "AVOID" or "SELL" recommendation** is warranted. Investors should carefully consider the risks associated with Boeing and potentially seek alternative investment opportunities.
