2025-12-28 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Boeing (BA) based on the data provided, broken down into the requested sections:

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Company Overview:** Boeing Co. is a leading global aerospace company primarily involved in the manufacturing of commercial jetliners, defense, space and security systems, and service provider of aftermarket support.
*   **BA Cumulative Return:** 5.47%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 103.21%
*   **Divergence:** -96.6 (Relative Divergence: 6.3)

**Analysis:**

Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the specified period. The -96.6 divergence highlights this substantial gap in returns. The low relative divergence of 6.3 suggests that, despite this underperformance, Boeing's current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range, implying it has been worse and could potentially revert toward a higher (less negative) divergence.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|------|-------|------|--------|

| 2019-2021  | -63.0% | 82.3% | -110.0%| 1.1 | 157.7  |
| 2020-2022  | -42.0% | 82.3% | -41.0% | 1.0 | 149.2  |

| 2023-2025  | -13.0% | 73.7% | -81.0% | 0.3 | 169.5  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Shows a significant decline in compounded annual growth rate over the periods, transitioning from high positive returns to negative returns in recent years.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown remains consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha values show the stock's underperformance compared to its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis. This means the stock is not generating excess returns given its risk profile.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are relatively low, suggesting Boeing's price movement is less sensitive to the overall market fluctuations (S&P 500). However, the Beta has risen significantly since 2017-2019, suggesting increasing market correlation.
*   **Cap:** Market capitalization has fluctuated. The period of underperformance has obviously reduced capitalization compared to its peak.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 216.44
*   **Last-market:** price: 216.44, previousClose: 218.16, change: -0.79
*   **5-day SMA:** 216.47
*   **20-day SMA:** 206.20
*   **60-day SMA:** 204.99

**Analysis:**

The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA, indicating a very slight recent downward trend. The 5-day SMA is above both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend overall. The 20-day and 60-day SMA's are very close to each other, which can suggest an impending direction change, either up or down.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 71.49 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.8672
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.0 (+) Short-term rise

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A high MRI suggests favorable market conditions for investment, however, this should be taken with caution and weighed against other indicators specific to Boeing.
*   **RSI:** The RSI indicates the stock is currently overbought, suggesting a potential pullback or consolidation in the near term.
*   **PPO:**  The Positive Percentage Oscillator (PPO) being positive indicates the stock is in an uptrend, even if slight.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This suggests a strong buy recommendation.
*   **Relative Divergence:** Short-term divergence increase.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is alarming and points to a highly unfavorable long-term outlook compared to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **China Sanctions on U.S. Defense Firms:** This is a negative headline, as Boeing is a major defense contractor. Sanctions could impact revenue.
*   **Boeing Stock Split:** While stock splits can sometimes boost investor sentiment, they don't fundamentally change the value of the company. This headline is neutral to slightly positive.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** Positive, the consensus is buy.
*   **Cwm LLC Purchases Shares:** This is a positive sign, indicating institutional investment.
*   **Boeing's Opportunity in 2026:** This is a forward-looking, potentially positive article, but depends heavily on execution.
*   **Boeing's Performance vs. Rivals:** This headline implies potential outperformance in some aspects, but requires further investigation.

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed. The China sanctions are a clear negative, while the stock split is generally neutral. The analyst ratings and Cwm LLC purchase are positive indicators. Overall, there are a few more positive signs than negatives, but the China sanctions are a critical factor to consider.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.59)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 244.54 / 285.00 / 150.00

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is positive, with a "Buy" rating and an average target price significantly above the current price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices suggests a degree of uncertainty and differing opinions among analysts.  The absence of any recent rating changes suggests that the analyst outlook has been stable recently.

|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $-8.25B     | 64.69%    |
| 2025-06-30   | $-3.29B     | 18.54%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue shows a positive trend.

*   **Equity:**  The company has negative equity, which is a significant concern and can indicate financial distress.
*   **ROE:** The high ROE figures are misleading due to the negative equity. A negative equity base inflates the ROE, making it an unreliable indicator of profitability in this case.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Boeing presents a mixed picture.

**Bearish Points:**

*   **Significant Underperformance vs. S&P 500:**  Boeing has drastically underperformed the broader market.
*   **Negative Alpha:**  Indicates poor risk-adjusted returns.
*   **High Maximum Drawdown:** Shows a history of large price declines.
*   **Negative Equity:**  Suggests serious financial challenges.
*   **Expected Return:** Indicates long-term underperformance.
*   **RSI:**  Overbought condition suggests a potential pullback.
*   **China Sanctions:** Represents a geopolitical and economic risk.

**Bullish Points:**

*   **Recent Revenue Growth:**  Shows improvement in sales.
*   **Analyst Consensus:**  The majority of analysts have a "Buy" rating.
*   **Cwm LLC Purchase:**  Institutional investment can signal confidence.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  Suggests a strong buy recommendation.
*   **MRI:**  A high MRI suggests favorable market conditions for investment, however, this should be taken with caution and weighed against other indicators specific to Boeing.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Boeing is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The company faces significant challenges, including negative equity, volatile profit margins, and geopolitical risks. However, there are also positive signs, such as increasing revenue, favorable analyst ratings, and recent institutional investment.

The extremely negative "Expected Return" is a major red flag. While analyst ratings are positive, investors should thoroughly weigh the risks and consider that the turnaround will take longer and will be more volatile than expected. The high MRI is very generalized and should not be taken as a leading indicator in the case of a company with known issues. Boeing requires careful monitoring and a strong understanding of the aerospace industry.
