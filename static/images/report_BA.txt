## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Boeing Co (BA) is a major aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling airplanes and defense products.  The company's recent performance shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **BA Cumulative Return:** -29.54%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 76.08%
* **Return Difference:** -105.6%  (This indicates BA significantly underperformed VOO.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 10.2% (This places BA's underperformance in the lower 10% of its historical range relative to VOO.)


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance over time, with periods of strong returns followed by substantial losses. This volatility contributes to the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  The high beta values (generally above 0.5) suggest high sensitivity to market movements.  Note that the CAGR figures need more context; the time frame of each CAGR calculation is not explicitly defined.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $156.47
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $156.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $163.14
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $169.73

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The recent price increase of $0.61 (from $155.52) is small compared to the longer-term downtrend and the distance to the moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.08 (Suggests the stock is oversold, but not necessarily a strong buy signal.)
* **PPO:** 0.02 (A slightly positive PPO indicates some upward momentum, but it's weak.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.1 (Minor short-term upward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** -683.1% (This extremely negative expected return suggests a very pessimistic outlook.  Further clarification is needed on how this figure was calculated and the assumptions made.)

The small recent price increase is not sufficient to counteract the negative long-term outlook suggested by the expected return.

Before making any investment decisions, a thorough evaluation of the company's long-term strategy, industry outlook, and competitive landscape is strongly recommended.  The high volatility and negative expected return raise significant concerns about the long-term viability of investment in BA.
