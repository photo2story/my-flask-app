### 9. 종합 Analysis & Conclusion

Based on the provided data, Boeing presents a mixed picture with significant challenges:

*   **Underperformance:** Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** High MDD indicates significant price volatility.
*   **Negative Alpha:** Suggests consistent underperformance relative to its benchmark.
*   **Technical Signals:** Short-term downward trend. Approaching oversold RSI, but negative PPO and hybrid sell signal.
*   **News:** The 777X delay is a major concern.
*   **Financials:** Negative equity is a major red flag.

**Overall Recommendation:** While analyst consensus is "Buy," the data suggests significant caution is warranted. The negative equity, underperformance, technical sell signals, and the 777X delay raise substantial concerns. A more conservative approach would be to reduce or avoid exposure to Boeing until its financial position improves and its operational challenges are resolved. The hybrid signal is quite clear in its recommendation to reduce holdings. Further investigation into the Analyst Report (Morningstar) is warranted to obtain additional insights.
