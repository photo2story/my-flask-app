    *Analysis:*
    *   **CAGR:**  Shows a clear trend of declining compounded annual growth rates over the recent periods, with negative values dominating the past several years.
    *   **MDD:**  High Maximum Drawdown values indicate significant volatility and risk, consistently above 70%.
    *   **Alpha:** Predominantly negative Alpha figures suggest Boeing has underperformed relative to its benchmark, especially in recent years.
    *   **Beta:**  The Beta values are generally low, implying Boeing's stock price isn't highly correlated with the broader market.  The Beta increased during the 2019-2022 period, indicating a short period of increased market sensitivity.
    *   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization has fluctuated, decreasing significantly in the 2018-2024 period and recovering somewhat recently.

*   **Analysis:** The stock is currently trading above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day simple moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **Profit Margin:** Fluctuates, with negative margins in two out of the five quarters. This volatility in profitability could be concerning.
    *   **Equity:** Negative equity indicates that Boeing's liabilities exceed its assets, suggesting financial distress. Although the magnitude of negative equity has improved recently.
    *   **ROE:** High ROE values, particularly when equity is negative, can be misleading. They suggest a high return on equity, but this is skewed by the negative equity base.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Summary:** Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While there are signs of short-term upward momentum, including positive news headlines, analyst ratings, and recent stock price movement, the underlying financial picture is mixed. The company is experiencing revenue growth but struggling with consistent profitability. The negative equity and fluctuating profit margins raise concerns about long-term financial health. The negative expected return indicates a significant forecast of underperformance.

*   **Investment Recommendation:** Given the negative equity, high debt, and historical underperformance, an investment in Boeing carries substantial risk. The positive short-term signals and analyst sentiment might attract some investors, but a cautious approach is warranted. Further research and monitoring of Boeing's financial health and operational performance are crucial before making any investment decisions. Consider that the historical data shows BA to be quite volatile, therefore investment should be approached in a long-term horizon with a focus on BA's fundamentals.
