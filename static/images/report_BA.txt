## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Boeing Co (BA) is an aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling airplanes, helicopters, rockets, and missiles.

The cumulative return for BA is -4.81%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 122.16%.  This represents a significant underperformance of BA compared to the market benchmark. The divergence, as calculated, is -127.0, placing it at the 6.1 percentile of the historical divergence range (-143.9 to 133.2).  This indicates BA's performance has been consistently below the S&P 500 over the period considered.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant volatility in BA's performance over the years, ranging from substantial gains to significant losses.  The alpha consistently sits around 0.2, suggesting a slight outperformance relative to the market (beta), but this is dwarfed by the overall negative cumulative return.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $176.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $175.20
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $173.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $161.62

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum.  However, it's still significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend. The recent price change (-$1.37) shows a minor daily drop, which is not considered a significant event.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.58 (slightly above the neutral 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.0396 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.7 (indicates a recent short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -984.6% (This extremely negative expected return is highly unusual and requires further investigation. It likely reflects the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and potentially incorporates unusual factors or assumptions not detailed here.)

The negative expected return and the other indicators suggest a cautious outlook, warranting further analysis before investment consideration.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistency. While revenue remains relatively stable around $25 Billion, EPS fluctuates. There's no clear upward or downward trend readily apparent from the provided data.  More detailed financial statement analysis is needed for a complete picture.  Note the duplication of data for October 29th, 2024, suggesting potential data entry errors.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | 25.34         |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.83 | 25.38         |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.77 | 25.82         |

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

The revenue shows some fluctuation, with a notable drop in Q3 2024. Profit margins are highly volatile, ranging from significant losses to double-digit gains. This highlights significant operational challenges and unpredictability in profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:**

Negative equity figures throughout the period are concerning, indicating a potentially high level of debt.  ROE (Return on Equity) is also erratic, reflecting the unstable financial performance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BA's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, indicating substantial underperformance. Technical indicators suggest a bearish momentum, although the RSI is not strongly indicative of an overbought or oversold condition. Earnings data shows inconsistent profitability, and financial statements reveal alarming negative equity and volatile profit margins.  The extremely negative projected return (-984.6%) requires critical examination to determine the underlying assumptions and methodologies used in its calculation. This is unlikely to be a reliable long-term prediction without further clarification.

Given the significant underperformance, volatile financials, and negative expected return (which needs further scrutiny), a cautious approach is warranted.  Further investigation into the company's specific challenges and future outlook is crucial before any investment decisions are made.  A deeper dive into the company's debt levels, order backlog, and future projections for aircraft deliveries is essential to assess its long-term prospects.
