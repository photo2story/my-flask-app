Boeing's cumulative return is significantly underperformed compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  While the S&P 500 shows a cumulative return of 112.19%, Boeing shows a negative cumulative return of -7.00%. This represents a substantial divergence of -119.2 percentage points.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance over the years, with periods of significant gains followed by substantial losses.  While the beta consistently hovers around 0.2, suggesting relatively low correlation with the overall market, the alpha is highly variable, indicating inconsistent outperformance.  The large negative CAGR values in several periods highlight the significant risk associated with investing in BA.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures further illustrate the volatility inherent in this stock.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $172.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $171.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $173.85
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $159.22

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  However, the 5-day moving average is close to the current price, indicating some recent price stabilization.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.68  (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.85 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -644.0% (This exceptionally negative figure indicates a significant underperformance expectation relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This should be treated with considerable caution and further investigation is needed to understand its derivation.)

The current price ($172.00) doesn't signal an immediate sharp upward or downward move based on the provided indicators alone. The extremely negative expected return should be critically evaluated, as such a large negative figure is unusual and warrants further investigation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue, with some fluctuation in EPS. There is a possible error in the data as 2024-10-29 appears twice.  A consistent downward trend in EPS from 2023-10-31 to 2024-04-30 is noticeable, followed by a slight recovery. Further analysis is needed to determine underlying causes.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | $25.34 B      |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.83 | $25.38 B      |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.77 | $25.82 B      |
| 2023-10-31 | 0.91 | $25.17 B      |
| 2024-10-29 | 0.91 | $25.17 B      | *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information shows inconsistent profitability, with significant swings in profit margins and negative equity. The high ROE in some quarters is not indicative of overall financial health given the negative equity.  The negative equity raises significant concerns about the company's financial stability.  Further investigation into the underlying causes of these fluctuations is crucial.


| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin | Equity     | ROE     |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | $17.84B   | -19.66%       | $-23.55B   | 26.20%  |
| 2024-06-30  | $16.87B   | 7.29%         | $-17.98B   | 8.01%   |
| 2024-03-31  | $16.57B   | 11.32%        | $-17.01B   | 2.02%   |
| 2023-12-31  | $22.02B   | 12.25%        | $-17.23B   | 0.13%   |
| 2023-09-30  | $18.10B   | 6.44%         | $-16.73B   | 9.78%   |


**7. Overall Summary:**

Boeing exhibits considerable volatility and inconsistency in its performance.  While the beta suggests low market correlation, the significant negative cumulative return compared to the S&P 500, combined with inconsistent earnings, negative profit margins in recent quarters, and negative equity, paint a concerning picture. The exceptionally negative long-term expected return warrants serious caution.  Before investing, thorough due diligence is absolutely essential, including a deep dive into the reasons for the company's financial instability and future growth prospects.  The data suggests substantial risk.
