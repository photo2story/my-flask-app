The table shows high volatility in CAGR, reflecting significant periods of both strong growth and substantial losses.  The negative alpha values in recent years consistently indicate underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The beta, while fluctuating, generally suggests higher-than-average market sensitivity.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $155.52
* **5-day Moving Average:** $146.24
* **20-day Moving Average:** $164.63
* **60-day Moving Average:** $170.63

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price drop of $3.3 (from $160.82) reinforces the negative trend.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.21 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -1.10 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +0.3 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -664.5% (This extremely negative figure requires further investigation and clarification.  It likely reflects a severe downside scenario and should not be taken as a definitive prediction.)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the negative PPO and the significant price drop point to bearish momentum.  The -664.5% expected return is alarming and needs further context and justification.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | $25.34 B      |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.83 | $25.38 B      |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.77 | $25.82 B      |
| 2023-10-31 | 0.91 | $25.17 B      |
| 2024-10-29 | 0.91 | $25.17 B      | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Revenue remains relatively stable around $25B, but EPS shows some fluctuation. The duplicate entry needs clarification.  Further analysis would require looking at the growth rate and comparing to previous years.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B | -10.43%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B | -19.66%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B | 7.29%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B | 11.32%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B | 12.25%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE          |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B  | 98.90%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B | 26.20%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B | 8.01%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B | 2.02%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B | 0.13%        |

The financial data reveals significant volatility and negative profit margins in recent quarters.  The negative equity figures require careful interpretation and further investigation into the company's financial health.  High ROE figures in some quarters are likely distorted by the negative equity values and should be viewed cautiously.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Boeing is currently experiencing a period of significant underperformance relative to the broader market.  The negative price trend, mixed technical indicators, and volatile financial results paint a concerning picture. The extremely negative expected return figure requires further investigation and cannot be considered reliable without additional justification.  The negative equity reported in several quarters warrants serious attention and further scrutiny of the company's financial statements and future prospects. A long-term investment strategy would necessitate a thorough understanding of the underlying factors contributing to the recent poor performance and a careful assessment of the company's potential for future recovery.  Given the current data, a buy decision would require a much more in-depth fundamental analysis to justify the risk.
