2024-11-20 - Analysis Report
## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Boeing (BA) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While the S&P 500 experienced a cumulative return of 124.78%, Boeing's cumulative return was -19.01%. This resulted in a substantial divergence of -143.79%, placing it at the 1.91 percentile of the historical range of divergence between BA and VOO.  Boeing's CAGR is highly volatile, ranging from -42.5% to 148.7% depending on the period, showcasing significant risk.  The high Beta values (generally above 1) indicate higher volatility than the market.  The Alpha values show periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $143.87 (Last Market: $144.37)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $141.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $150.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $155.18

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (39.59):** Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.68):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-0.28):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided 0% expected return is likely a statement of the model's inability to predict future returns with certainty, not a definitive prediction. Long-term (2+ years) investment with regular contributions might offer some potential for outperformance over the S&P 500 despite the current situation, though this depends heavily on market conditions and Boeing's future performance.  The significant volatility and past underperformance of BA compared to VOO must be considered.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

Boeing's recent quarterly earnings show some volatility in both revenue and EPS. While revenue remains relatively consistent around $25B, EPS fluctuates.  The most recent quarter (2024-10-29) shows a slight decrease in EPS compared to the previous quarter (2024-07-30).  Missing is the EPS and revenue *forecast* for comparison.  A more detailed analysis requires access to analyst forecasts and a deeper dive into the financial statements.

**5. Financial Information:**

The provided financial data highlights significant volatility in profitability (Revenue and Profitability table) and equity (Capital and Profitability table).  High ROE figures are presented, but need to be considered in relation to the significant negative equity value, indicating significant debt load that may need to be factored in alongside ROE for a complete picture of financial health. The large negative equity number is a major concern and needs further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires access to real-time news sources and financial data providers like Shacknews and Finbold.

**7.  Analyst Opinions and Recent Market Outlook:**

*(This section also requires access to real-time financial data providers and news sources.  I need current information on analyst ratings, forecasts, and recent market commentary on Boeing to fulfill this request.)*  I would look for overall sentiment on Boeing's future from financial analysts, as well as news about recent market trends and factors impacting their outlook.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing is currently facing significant challenges.  While the RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, the negative PPO and below-average moving averages indicate bearish momentum. The company's recent financial performance exhibits volatility, and the substantial negative equity is a major red flag.  The historical underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the high volatility suggest a high-risk investment.  The 0% expected return is essentially a caveat acknowledging this uncertainty.  Thorough due diligence, including review of detailed financial statements, recent news, and analyst reports, is critical before any investment decision.  A long-term strategy might offer some chance of outperformance but carries substantial risk.
