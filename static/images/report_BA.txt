**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Boeing's stock presents a mixed picture. The company has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.

The high RSI suggests that a correction is on the way.

While analysts have positive views and there are recent positive news articles, the financial data suggests high risk.  The extremely negative expected return indicates significant long-term risk compared to the S&P 500. Therefore, a cautious approach is advised, considering both the potential for short-term gains and the underlying risks.
