**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively consistent revenue around $25B, but EPS is fluctuating and has declined slightly in the most recent quarter.  A more detailed analysis would require looking at margins, expenses, and other financial metrics.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | 25.34 B$ |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.83 | 25.38 B$ |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.77 | 25.82 B$ |
| 2023-10-31 | 0.91 | 25.17 B$ |
| 2024-10-29 | 0.91 | 25.17 B$ | *(Duplicate entry)*


**5) Financial Information:**

The financial data shows significant volatility in profitability and equity.  Negative equity in several quarters is a major concern.  The high ROE figures in some quarters may be misleading due to the negative equity, potentially reflecting accounting complexities rather than true profitability.  Further investigation into the specifics of Boeing's financial situation is required.


| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $19.50B | 12.40% |
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B | -10.43% |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B | -19.66% |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B | 7.29% |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B | 11.32% |

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-03-31 | $-3.33B | 1.11% |
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B | 98.90% |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B | 26.20% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B | 8.01% |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B | 2.02% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's stock performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.  While recent price action shows some upward momentum, the long-term outlook is clouded by persistent negative alpha, high beta, inconsistent earnings, and concerning financial statements showing negative equity and fluctuating profitability.  The extremely negative projected return (-661.7%) warrants intense scrutiny and a thorough understanding of the methodology employed in its calculation.  Before making any investment decisions, further in-depth analysis of Boeing's financial health, industry dynamics, and future growth prospects is strongly recommended.  The high volatility makes this a high-risk investment.
