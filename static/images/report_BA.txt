This report analyzes Boeing's recent performance, considering its stock performance relative to the S&P 500, technical indicators, recent news, analyst opinions, earnings, and financial health.  The analysis indicates a challenging situation, with underperformance relative to the market, negative technical signals, concerning news headlines, and mixed financial data.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
| :----------- | :------ | :------ | :------ | :----- | :------ |

| 2023-2025  | 1.0%    | 69.7%   | -53.0%  | -0.8   | 163.3   |

**Analysis:** The table highlights significant volatility. Notably, the periods from 2018 onwards show substantial negative Alpha, indicating Boeing underperformed its expected return based on its risk (Beta). The negative Beta values in recent years suggest a potential inverse relationship with the market, meaning it could move in the opposite direction. The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) consistently above 40% shows significant risk.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 215.94
*   **Previous Close:** 219.99
*   **Change:** -1.84
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 224.78
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 229.50
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 224.35

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), indicating a short-term downtrend. The recent price decrease of -1.84 from the previous close is a continuation of this trend.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.32 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 30.11 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.83
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_59%_Sell 59.5% of holdings (256 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33)
*   **Delta Previous Relative Divergence (20-day):** -1.8 (Negative Trend)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -618.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests the broad market conditions don't pose a significant risk. However, in isolation, this doesn't offset the negative signals from other indicators.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is in oversold territory (below 30), which *could* suggest a potential for a short-term bounce. *However*, given the other negative indicators, this should be viewed with caution. An oversold RSI doesn't guarantee an immediate price increase.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO indicates a downtrend in price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Strong Sell signal suggests that selling a significant portion of holdings is advised.
*   **Delta Relative Divergence:** The negative change in relative divergence indicates continued underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-618.1%) suggests significant concerns about Boeing's long-term performance relative to the S&P 500, warranting extreme caution.
*   **Price Change Impact:** The price change of -1.84, although not an extreme drop, is enough to reinforce the negative trends seen in the moving averages and other indicators.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **FAA Seeks Fines:** Safety violations and the 2024 midair panel blowout continue to haunt Boeing, leading to potential fines.
*   **Valuation Evaluation:** Articles are questioning Boeing's current valuation.
*   **Defense Union Rejection:** The rejection of the latest contract offer by the Boeing defense union adds to the company's labor challenges.
*   **777X Delays:** Delays in the 777X program are negatively impacting the stock.

**Analysis:** The news flow is overwhelmingly negative. Safety concerns, financial scrutiny, labor disputes, and program delays are all weighing on investor sentiment.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.58)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 251.96, High: 287.00, Low: 150.00

**Analysis:**  While the analyst consensus is "Buy", the wide range in target prices (150.00 to 287.00) suggests uncertainty among analysts regarding Boeing's future performance. The average target price is significantly higher than the current price, implying potential upside *if* Boeing can overcome its current challenges.
