**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows significant volatility. After strong growth periods, Boeing experienced substantial negative CAGR in recent years.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** The negative Alpha values across most periods suggest Boeing has underperformed relative to its expected return based on its risk (Beta). The significantly negative Alphas in recent periods are particularly concerning.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally low, particularly earlier in the data. This suggests Boeing's price movements are less correlated with the overall market than some other stocks. However, the Beta has increased over time (specifically 2019-2022), suggesting it has become more sensitive to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization (in Billions) has fluctuated.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 208.27
*   **Previous Close:** 206.33
*   **Change:** 0.94
*   **5-day SMA:** 206.238
*   **20-day SMA:** 197.4621
*   **60-day SMA:** 204.9408

**Analysis:**

The stock price is currently above its 5-day, 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA, further reinforcing the bullish signal.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 73.47 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.7959
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.0 (+) (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -746.4

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.7 indicates a medium level of investment risk according to this specific metric.
*   The RSI of 73.47 suggests the stock is currently overbought, potentially signaling a possible correction.
*   The PPO indicates the price is above its moving averages.
*   The hybrid signal suggests a "very safe" buy, allocating 100% of cash, with a suggestion for ongoing monthly investment, however the suggestion is contradictory to the -746.4 expected return.
*   The recent change in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend.
*   The *extremely* negative expected return of -746.4% is highly concerning and warrants careful consideration. This suggests very negative future prospects as estimated by this particular calculation.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **FAA Review of Alerting Systems:** The FAA is reviewing Boeing's alerting systems, which is critical for safety and could impact future production and deliveries.
*   **Analyst Targets & Forecasts:** Articles discuss analyst targets for 2026, FAA's 737 MAX safety plan and delivery outlook.

*   **Air Force One Delays:** There are reported delays in the Air Force One program.

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed. The FAA review adds uncertainty but is essential for long-term safety. Analyst activity and stock recommendations provide some optimism. However, cuts in stock holdings by Valeo Financial Advisors could be a concern. The Air Force One delays are also a negative factor, impacting revenue and reputation.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.59)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 244.33 / 285.00 / 150.00

**Analysis:**

Analysts generally have a "Buy" consensus on Boeing, with an average target price above the current price. However, there is a wide range of target prices, reflecting uncertainty about the company's future. It is worth noting that there is no information in the Recent Rating Changes section.

Further research and a deep understanding of the company's turnaround plans are necessary before making any investment decisions. It's crucial to understand the discrepancy between the positive analyst ratings, potentially positive earnings/revenue trends, and the extremely negative future expected return. The overbought RSI suggests caution in the short term.
