        *   **Strong Historical Performance (Early Period):** From 2015-2019, Boeing exhibited substantial CAGR and positive Alpha, indicating outperformance relative to the market, with a low Beta of around 0 to 0.2
        *   **Sharp Deterioration (More Recent Period):** From 2018 onward, Boeing's performance plummeted with negative CAGRs, significantly negative Alphas, and increasing Betas. This suggests substantial underperformance and increased sensitivity to market movements.

        *   **Beta:** The Beta values increased substantially in 2019-2022, indicating that BA became much more correlated and sensitive to market movements.
        *   **Market Capitalization:**  The market capitalization has fluctuated significantly, reflecting the stock's volatile performance.

*   **Current Price:** 203.74

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Boeing presents a mixed picture.

*   **Positives:** Recent news is overwhelmingly positive, driven by expectations of positive free cash flow and increased deliveries. Analyst consensus is "Buy," with a significant upside target price. Recent earnings show a generally increasing trend in EPS and revenue. The MRI is high, and technical indicators suggest a potential buying opportunity.
*   **Negatives:** Boeing's stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The negative expected return is a major red flag, possibly suggesting that positive short-term signals are just temporary reliefs, or caused by technical rebound. The company has struggled with revenue volatility and inconsistent profitability. Persistently negative equity is a major financial concern.
*   **Overall Assessment:**  Investing in Boeing at this point is *highly speculative*. The potential for a turnaround is present, driven by positive news and analyst sentiment. However, the company faces significant financial challenges and historical underperformance.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential rewards against the substantial risks before investing. The recent positive momentum might be a short-term bounce rather than a sustained recovery.
