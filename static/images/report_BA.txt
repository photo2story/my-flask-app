However, the negative PPO and the declining relative divergence confirm the recent downward trend. The Hybrid Signal suggests a cautious approach: hold a high cash position, reduce holdings slightly, and make small monthly investments, reflecting the uncertainty. The significantly negative expected return should be taken with caution, as it is a model-driven estimate and may not fully account for all potential scenarios or company-specific catalysts. The small change in price compared to the previous day suggests no immediate reaction to any significant news or events.

| 2025-06-30 | \$-3.29B  | 18.54%    |
| 2025-03-31 | \$-3.33B  | 1.11%     |

| 2024-06-30 | \$-17.98B | 8.01%     |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has generally been increasing over the past year, with profit margins showing a recovery after negative values in late 2024. The negative equity values are concerning and indicate a significant debt burden or accumulated losses. The ROE fluctuates widely, and while some recent values are high, they are calculated on a negative equity base, making them less meaningful.

**7. Overall Summary**

Boeing (BA) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, though the stock is approaching oversold territory.  The Hybrid Signal and negative expected return indicate significant caution from the model. Recent news suggests ongoing scrutiny and volatility. Earnings have been stable with a recent increase, and revenue has shown a general upward trend, although the company's negative equity and fluctuating ROE raise concerns.

**Recommendation:**

Given the underperformance, recent downtrend, and financial concerns, a cautious approach is warranted. Investors should closely monitor company-specific news, financial performance, and analyst ratings before making any investment decisions.
