**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows periods of high growth followed by significant declines.  Recent periods show negative CAGR, indicating losses.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant price volatility and potential for substantial losses.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are largely negative, implying BA has underperformed its benchmark (presumably the S&P 500) during these periods.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are relatively low (generally below 1), suggesting BA has been less volatile than the overall market. This is somewhat contradictory to the high MDD, suggesting BA's losses have been steeper than the market's during downturns.
*   **Cap(B):** The company's market capitalization has fluctuated over the years, reflecting investor sentiment and market conditions.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 197.13
*   **Last Market Close:** Price: 197.09, Previous Close: 198.05, Change: -0.48
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 203.27
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 213.12
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 221.03

**Analysis:** The price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), indicating a downtrend.  The small change from the previous close (-0.48) doesn't reflect a major one-day event, but it continues the trend.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 32.91 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** -0.83 (Negative, suggesting a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (466 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-06)
*   **Recent (20-Day) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.1 (Negative - indicates short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3879.3 (Significantly negative; suggests substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in a long-term, dollar-cost averaging scenario)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests the market as a whole is considered a "High Investment Recommended" environment.  However, this is a general market indicator and not specific to Boeing.
*   The RSI is approaching oversold levels, which *could* indicate a potential for a short-term bounce.
*   The negative PPO confirms the downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal is recommending a full investment of available cash, seemingly contradicting the negative long-term return expectation.  This likely prioritizes safety based on the high MRI.
*   The very large, negative Expected Return figure should be a red flag.  It strongly suggests that even with dollar-cost averaging over a long period, Boeing is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500. The recent change in relative divergence (-1.1) reinforces this negative outlook, indicating a worsening of Boeing's performance compared to the S&P 500 in the short term.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Positive:** Kratos Defense Beats on Q3 Earnings, Raises '25 Revenue View; Navigating Volatility: How Defense ETFs' Dip Offers Long-Run Opportunity; BAE Systems' Compass Call Mission Crew Simulator approved by U.S. Air Force
*   **Neutral/Mixed:** The Boeing Company (BA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It; Iron Mountain beats third-quarter earnings estimates on AI-driven data center demand; October earnings update: Amazon, Fiserv, Eli Lilly, Reddit, Tesla and more

**Analysis:**

*   The news is a mixed bag. The articles about Boeing itself are more general.
*   Positive news about defense companies generally (Kratos, BAE) *could* indirectly benefit Boeing if the overall defense sector is strong.

### 4-2. Analyst Opinions

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean Rating: 1.52)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 22
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 251.82 / High: 287.00 / Low: 170.00

**Analysis:**

*   Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating on Boeing and the average target price is significantly higher than the current price. This represents a potential upside if analysts' expectations are met. However, consider the recent performance data and the negative long-term outlook.
*   The range of target prices is quite wide (170.00 to 287.00), indicating some uncertainty among analysts.

*   **Capital & Profitability:**  Boeing has negative equity, which is a concern. ROE (Return on Equity) is highly variable. The negative equity and fluctuating ROE values suggest potential financial instability.

### 7. Overall Summary

Boeing presents a mixed picture:

*   **Negative Factors:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative long-term return expectation (even with dollar-cost averaging), downtrending price action, negative equity, high historical volatility (MDD), significant recent relative divergence indicating worsening performance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Positive Factors:** Recent improvements in EPS and Revenue, analysts' "Buy" consensus and target prices, potential oversold condition (RSI), recent return to positive profit margins.

**Conclusion:**

Despite some positive short-term indicators and analyst optimism, the overwhelming data suggests significant risks associated with investing in Boeing. The negative equity, large negative expected return, and historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500 are major concerns. Investors should proceed with extreme caution and carefully consider their risk tolerance. The analyst target prices should be viewed with skepticism given the other concerning data points. The negative long-term return expectation and significant recent relative divergence strongly suggest that, even with dollar-cost averaging, Boeing is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.
