**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Boeing Co (BA) is a major aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling airplanes and related products and services.

The cumulative return of BA (-6.10%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) return (119.94%).  The difference is a substantial -126.0%, placing it at the 6.5th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (-143.9% to 133.2%).  This indicates BA has significantly underperformed the market over the analyzed period.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data reveals significant volatility in BA's performance. While some periods showed strong returns (e.g., 2016-2018), others experienced substantial losses (e.g., 2018-2021).  The consistent alpha of 0.2 suggests a slight outperformance relative to the market, but this is overshadowed by the significantly negative cumulative return.  The beta consistently around 0.2 indicates low correlation with the overall market.

The recent price drop (-$2.32) compared to the previous close shows a minor downward pressure.

* **RSI:** 51.87 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.08 (Negative; suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength (20-day):**  A recent increase of 0.4 indicates a short-term upward trend, potentially countering the negative PPO.

|------------|------------|---------------|------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B    | -19.66%       | $-23.55B   | 26.20%  |

| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B    | 12.25%        | $-17.23B   | 0.13%   |
| 2023-09-30 | $18.10B    | 6.44%         | $-16.73B   | 9.78%   |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance is currently weak.  The significant underperformance against the S&P 500, negative expected return, and volatile financial indicators suggest considerable risk.  While short-term technical indicators hint at potential upward movement, the underlying financial health and long-term outlook remain a serious concern.  A long-term investment strategy should carefully weigh the significant potential for losses against any possible upside.  Further investigation into the causes of recent underperformance and the long-term viability of the company's strategy is critical before considering any investment.  The negative equity is particularly worrying and requires deeper analysis.
