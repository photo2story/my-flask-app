**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows significant volatility, with strong positive performance in earlier periods (2015-2019) followed by substantial negative performance in more recent periods.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and price declines.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are mostly negative, suggesting underperformance compared to a benchmark (likely the market), with some periods of significant underperformance (e.g., -110.0% in 2019-2021).
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, suggesting that Boeing's price is less sensitive to market movements (although the 1.1 beta in 2019-2021 indicates a period where it was *more* sensitive).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated significantly, reflecting the company's performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 218.5
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 218.5, 'previousClose': 217.25, 'change': 0.58}
*   **5-day SMA:** 217.44
*   **20-day SMA:** 208.30
*   **60-day SMA:** 205.03

**Analysis:** The current closing price is above all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA), which is generally considered a bullish signal. The 5-day SMA is just slightly above the 20-day, which is above the 60-day, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The recent change from the previous close is relatively small, suggesting moderate price movement.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Other Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 85.37 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.65
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.1 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -674.4

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI of 0.9 suggests a favorable market environment for investment, according to this specific indicator.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is significantly above 70, indicating that the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction or pullback.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, which can indicate an upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal suggests a strong buy recommendation based on risk assessment (MRI), but limited shares, it also suggests that based on this amount you should invest 0.8% of your total investment in the stock and that on Dec. 1, 2025 you should own no cash as part of your overall investment strategy.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence indicates a recent short-term decline in Boeing's performance relative to the comparison.
*   **Expected Return:** A highly negative expected return is a *major* red flag. It suggests that, based on the model used, long-term investment in Boeing is projected to result in significant losses compared to the S&P 500.

*   **Institutional Holding:** Cadinha & Co. LLC holds a significant stake in Boeing.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. The new contract and potential production increase are positive developments. The Barron's article indicates some analyst optimism. However, it's crucial to consider the *basis* for these optimistic projections, given the other negative indicators.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue has generally been increasing over the recent quarters.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have fluctuated, with negative margins in some quarters, indicating potential challenges in profitability.
*   **Equity:** The negative equity suggests that Boeing's liabilities exceed its assets, which is concerning.
*   **ROE:** ROE (Return on Equity) is high, which might seem positive, but needs to be interpreted cautiously in light of the negative equity. A high ROE with negative equity can be misleading.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Overall, the analysis paints a mixed picture for Boeing.

*   **Negative Signals:** Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial divergence. Historical Alpha values are predominantly negative. Equity is negative, and the expected return is extremely negative. The RSI indicates an overbought condition.
*   **Positive Signals:** Recent news includes a large contract and potential production increases. Analyst consensus is generally a "Buy" with a target price above the current price, and recent earnings data show positive trends. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) is high.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The high ROE might be misleading due to the negative equity. Profit margins have been inconsistent.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in Boeing appears risky based on this data. While recent news and analyst opinions offer some hope, the strong negative indicators, especially the divergence from the S&P 500, the negative equity, and the projected negative long-term returns, should give potential investors pause. The overbought RSI also suggests caution in the short term. A deeper investigation into the reasons behind the negative equity and the model used to generate the expected return is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
