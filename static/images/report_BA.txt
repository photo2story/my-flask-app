* **20-day Moving Average:** $160.26
* **60-day Moving Average:** $154.29

The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, this should be interpreted cautiously given the longer-term underperformance.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 81.32 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.

* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +4.2 –  Indicates a short-term upward trend.

The current price of $177.04, being above the moving averages and considering the high RSI, might suggest a potential short-term price correction or consolidation phase.  While the positive PPO suggests continued upward momentum, caution is warranted due to the overbought RSI and the longer-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500.

Further investigation into the reasons for the inconsistent performance and the current market outlook is crucial before making any investment decision.  The absence of news and analyst opinions further limits the ability to provide a comprehensive assessment.  Investors should carefully consider the risks before investing in BA.
