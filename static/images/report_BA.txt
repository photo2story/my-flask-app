**1. Performance Comparison:**

Boeing Co (BA) is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and other aerospace and defense products and related services.

BA's cumulative return of -15.51% significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) which achieved a return of 87.98%.  The substantial negative difference of -103.5% highlights BA's underperformance relative to the broader market.  The relative divergence of 11.1% places this underperformance within its historical context, indicating significant but not unprecedented underperformance.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed results across different time periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance) and high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), other periods, particularly from 2018-2021, show extremely negative returns and alpha, suggesting significant volatility and periods of considerable underperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $191.70
* **Last Market Price:** $194.85 (Up $1.64 from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $187.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $172.98
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $169.78

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. The recent increase of $1.64 reflects a potential short-term price surge (though it needs further confirmation of trend).

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 indicates a medium risk level.
* **RSI (89.19):** Extremely overbought, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (1.11):** Bullish signal, indicating upward momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change:** 0.7 (+), indicating a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -622.4%. This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a significant red flag and suggests strong caution for long-term investment unless there's a significant shift in the company's fundamentals and outlook.  The large negative number warrants investigation into the calculation's underlying assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $19.50B    | 12.40%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B    | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B    | -19.66%       |

| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B    | 11.32%        |

Profit margins are highly volatile, showing significant losses in Q3 and Q4 2024.  Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally an upward trend in recent quarters.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity       | ROE           |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $-3.33B     | 1.11%         |
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B     | 98.90%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B    | 26.20%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B    | 8.01%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B    | 2.02%         |

Negative equity across all quarters is a significant concern.  ROE is also volatile, and the unusually high ROE in Q4 2024 requires further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BA's performance is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500.  While recent earnings and revenue show some positive signs, the extremely negative expected return, high RSI (overbought), negative equity, and volatile profit margins raise serious concerns.  The unusually high ROE in Q4 2024 needs further explanation.  Before considering any investment in BA, a thorough due diligence is required to understand the underlying reasons for the company's underperformance and the reliability of the provided expected return calculation.  The negative equity is a particularly serious red flag, highlighting significant financial risks.  Short-term price movements should be viewed with caution given the underlying fundamental weaknesses.
