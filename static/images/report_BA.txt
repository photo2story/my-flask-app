**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest bearish sentiment, and the financial statements reveal serious concerns about profitability and financial stability. The extremely negative expected return highlights substantial risk.  While some periods show strong performance, the overall picture suggests a high-risk investment with limited upside potential based on the current data.  Further investigation into the company's strategic initiatives, future order backlog, and management's plan to address financial issues is crucial before making any investment decisions.  This analysis relies on limited data and should be supplemented with more in-depth research.
