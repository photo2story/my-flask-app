## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

Boeing Co (BA) is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide.  The company's performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO) shows significant underperformance.  Recent financial data reveals inconsistent profitability and fluctuating capital levels. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment.

**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **BA Cumulative Return:** -4.18%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 118.31%
* **Return Difference:** -122.49%
* **Relative Divergence:** 7.7% (This indicates BA's underperformance is in the lower 7.7th percentile of historical divergences relative to the S&P 500.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows highly variable performance over the years, with periods of significant outperformance and substantial underperformance compared to the market (Beta >1 indicating higher volatility than the market). The large negative Alpha values in certain periods indicate underperformance compared to market expectations.  This volatility underscores the risk associated with BA investments.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $177.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $182.71
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $180.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $171.96

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price drop from the previous close of $180.88 to $177.15 reflects a minor negative trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.97 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.33 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Indicating recent short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -770.0% (This extremely negative figure suggests a significant projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This figure needs further scrutiny and is likely unrealistic given other data in the report.)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-29 | $0.82 | $25.34B      |
| 2024-07-30 | $0.83 | $25.38B      |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.77 | $25.82B      |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.91 | $25.17B      |
| 2024-10-29 | $0.91 | $25.17B      |

There appears to be a duplication of data for October 29th, 2024.  Revenue is relatively stable, but EPS shows some fluctuation.  Further analysis is needed to assess the overall trend and profitability. Note that reported numbers seem to be incomplete and require more context to fully interpret.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B    | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B    | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B    | 7.29%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B    | 11.32%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B    | 12.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE           |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B    | 98.90%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B   | 26.20%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B   | 8.01%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B   | 2.02%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B   | 0.13%         |

Both tables show significant volatility in profitability and equity.  Negative equity in multiple quarters raises serious concerns about the financial health of the company.  The high ROE figures in some quarters need to be viewed in the context of the negative equity; high ROE with negative equity can be a misleading indicator.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While recent revenue has been relatively stable, profitability is highly inconsistent, and the company exhibits concerning negative equity in several quarters.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment.  The extremely negative projected long-term return (-770%) requires further investigation and is likely an outlier.  Given the financial instability and underperformance relative to the market, a cautious approach is advised.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's debt levels, future order book, and management strategy, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The provided data is incomplete and potentially contains errors, requiring additional data for robust analysis.
