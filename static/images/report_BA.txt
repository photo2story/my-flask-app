**Analysis:** The current price is slightly down from the previous close. The stock price is trading above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, but below its 5-day moving average, indicating a possible short-term pullback. The relatively small change from the previous close doesn't indicate any major price shock.

**7. 종합 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

Boeing presents a mixed and concerning picture. While revenue shows some signs of improvement, profitability is inconsistent, and the company's negative equity is a major red flag. The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and technical indicators suggest it may be overbought in the short term. Analyst commentary highlights ongoing risks and uncertainties. The extremely negative expected return suggests significant long-term challenges. Investors should exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering an investment in Boeing. The seemingly contradictory signals (Low MRI, but cautionary Hybrid Signal) suggest the market is giving mixed signals.
