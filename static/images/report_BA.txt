## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Review

This report analyzes Boeing Co (BA), a major aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling commercial jetliners, defense products, and space systems.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Boeing's cumulative return of -11.32% significantly underperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return of 120.40%. The difference is a substantial -131.7%, placing it at the 4.4th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates considerable underperformance relative to the broader market. The provided CAGR data shows periods of strong performance interspersed with periods of significant losses, particularly between 2018 and 2021.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $164.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $158.00
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $150.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.37

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  However, the relatively small difference between the price and the moving averages doesn't definitively confirm a strong uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 72.95 – Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70).  This suggests potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO:** 0.96 – Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.9 – Shows a recent short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% –  This indicates that based on the provided data, no significant excess return over the S&P 500 is expected in the long term (2+ years).  This should be viewed cautiously given the inherently uncertain nature of long-term market predictions.  The historical data suggests significant volatility and periods of underperformance.

The closing price of 164.15 doesn't show a significant and sudden jump to suggest a rapid upward or downward movement.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals some inconsistencies:  The October 29th, 2024 entry appears twice.  Ignoring the duplicate, the data shows:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has remained relatively stable around $25B, with minor fluctuations. No clear upward or downward trend is immediately apparent from the given data.
* **EPS:** EPS shows some fluctuation.  There's no consistent upward or downward trend easily discernible from the limited data. There's no information on earnings expectations to assess "beats" or "misses."

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates, and profit margins are highly volatile, ranging from significant losses (-19.66%) to strong profitability (12.25%). This volatility underscores the inherent risk associated with Boeing's business.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Negative equity values indicate a significant level of debt.  ROE shows considerable variability, reflecting the unstable financial performance.

This section requires information on recent news (within the past 2 days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This data was not provided and needs to be added for a complete analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance significantly lags the S&P 500. While recent price action shows potential short-term upward movement (above moving averages), technical indicators suggest caution (high RSI). Earnings data reveals inconsistency and volatility in both revenue and profit margins.  The company's significant debt burden (negative equity) is a major concern.  A long-term investment requires careful consideration of its inherent risks. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a full evaluation of the current market sentiment and future prospects.  Further investigation into the reasons for the periods of substantial underperformance (as shown in the CAGR data) is necessary before forming a complete investment thesis.
