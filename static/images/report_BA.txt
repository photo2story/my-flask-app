    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values are very high across all periods, signaling significant volatility and potential for large losses.
    *   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are mostly negative, indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark (risk-adjusted).
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally low (close to or below 1), suggesting that Boeing's price is not as sensitive to market movements as the overall market, but the negative Alpha suggests underperformance regardless of market sensitivity.

**2.  Recent Stock Price Movement:**

*   **Current Price:** $212.4784
*   **Last Market Data:** `{'price': 212.39, 'previousClose': 216.0, 'change': -1.67}` (Shows a slight price decrease from the previous close.)  The change of -1.67 suggests a minor negative price movement.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day MA: 219.1297
    *   20-day MA: 217.9384
    *   60-day MA: 225.807

    The current price is below all three moving averages, which is generally considered a bearish signal. The 5-day MA is below the 20-day MA, which is also a short-term bearish indicator.

**3.  Technical Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - This is somewhat contradictory given the other data, but suggests the model sees a generally favorable market environment. However, relying solely on this indicator could be misleading.
*   **RSI:** 46.99 (Neutral) - RSI around 50 doesn't give a clear buy or sell signal.
*   **PPO:** 0.2358 - PPO is slightly positive, which indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (450 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-06).  This model suggests a full investment based on MRI, labeling it as "Very Safe".
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Disparity Change:** 0.9 (+) - Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative performance (relative to the S&P 500).
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1925.6% - This is an extremely negative expected return, implying significant long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if investing now. The large negative value should be carefully considered.

**4.  Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Headlines:** Several headlines point to challenges for Boeing and related companies (Spirit AeroSystems). Issues include delivery delays, management probes, and being identified as a stock to avoid.
*   **Positive Headline:**  Goldman Sachs maintains a "Buy" rating and adjusts the price target upwards. However, the target price increase is marginal.
*   **Mixed Headline:**  Norwegian's expanded Boeing 737 MAX order is a positive signal, but the impact on Norwegian Air Shuttle investors needs to be evaluated.
*   **Neutral Headline:** L3Harris Expands New VAMPIRE System Variants to Boost Capabilities (Zacks)
*   **Trending Headline:** Here is What to Know Beyond Why The Boeing Company (BA) is a Trending Stock (Zacks)

The news sentiment appears mixed to slightly negative overall.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Overall "Buy" rating with a mean of 1.56.
*   **Target Price:** Average target price is $252.95, representing a significant upside potential from the current price.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent rating changes were provided. The absence of changes limits the ability to comment on analyst sentiment shifts.

*   **Negative Equity:** The consistently negative equity is a major concern.
*   **Caution Advised:** Given the significant underperformance, high volatility, negative equity, mixed news sentiment, and extremely negative expected return, a **cautious approach to investing in Boeing is warranted.** While analysts remain optimistic, the underlying financials and recent performance raise red flags.
