**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Boeing's stock performance has been significantly volatile and significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  While some short-term indicators suggest a potential uptrend, the negative expected return (-540.2%, which requires further scrutiny), high RSI, and inconsistent earnings and financial data raise serious concerns.  The negative equity in multiple quarters is a major red flag.  A long-term investment strategy in BA needs careful consideration and thorough due diligence, given the significant financial and operational risks highlighted in this analysis.  The negative expected return is likely a flawed model prediction and should not be taken as a reliable forecast.  Further investigation into the source and calculation of this figure is necessary.  A comprehensive analysis of the company's strategic plans, industry trends, and potential catalysts for future growth is needed before making any investment decisions.
