**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows inconsistent quarterly results. While revenue remains relatively stable around $25 billion, EPS and profit margins are volatile. The most recent quarterly results (2024-09-30) show a significant loss (-$3.51B) and a negative profit margin (-19.66%), a considerable downturn from previous quarters.  The slight increase in EPS from the previous quarter might be seen as positive, but the substantial decline in profit margin and the overall loss are substantial concerns.  More information, particularly regarding analyst expectations for the 2024-09-30 quarter, is needed for a complete assessment.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The Revenue and Profitability data reveals significant quarterly fluctuations in both revenue and profit.  High revenue quarters do not always translate to high profit, illustrating the company's susceptibility to factors beyond sales volume.  Similarly, Capital and Profitability data highlight instability in Equity and ROE (Return on Equity).  The negative equity in several quarters warrants further investigation into the company's financial health and debt levels.  The high ROE values in some quarters might be misleading without considering the negative equity.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

**7.  Overall Analysis:**

Boeing is currently facing challenges. The stock is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, showing a clear downward trend in the short term. While the RSI suggests an oversold condition, potentially indicating a bounce, the negative PPO and recent financial results raise concerns. The highly volatile past performance suggests a significant risk profile. The 0% expected long-term return compared to the S&P 500 highlights a lack of confidence in significant future outperformance.   Further investigation into recent news and analyst opinions is vital before making any investment decisions.  A deep dive into the reasons for the recent loss and a detailed assessment of the company's restructuring and future growth strategy are necessary for a clearer picture.  The current negative financial metrics indicate a high level of risk.
