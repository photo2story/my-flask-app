    *   60-day: 221.03
*   **Analysis:** The stock price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downward trend. The small change on the last market day suggests a potential stabilization or minor fluctuation around the current levels, but this needs confirmation with more data.

### 3. Technical Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 32.91 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.83
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (466 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-06)

*   **Expected Return:** -3830.0% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, which seems contradictory given other indicators.
    *   The RSI is nearing oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity, although it could also mean the stock is just weak.
    *   The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is negative, indicating a downtrend.
    *   The hybrid signal recommends a full buy strategy based on the MRI, further emphasizing the conflicting signals.
    *   The recent relative divergence change indicates a short-term upward trend.
    *   The extremely negative expected return is very concerning, suggesting significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. The price change on the last market day does not seem to be large enough to be considered as a significant change or reflection of market sentiment.
