Negative equity in several quarters is a significant concern.  While high ROE values appear positive, they are likely distorted by the negative equity figures and should be interpreted cautiously.  Negative profit margins in recent quarters raise serious questions about the company's financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance is significantly lagging the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions and bearish momentum.  The recent price drop is substantial.  Furthermore, the company's financial statements reveal concerning negative profit margins and negative equity, raising serious questions about its long-term viability.  The extremely negative expected return figure requires further investigation.  Given the combination of underperformance, negative financial indicators, and high risk as evidenced by large MDD, a cautious approach to investing in BA is strongly advised.  Further investigation into the cause of the large negative expected return and the duplicate entry in the earnings data is crucial before making any investment decision.
