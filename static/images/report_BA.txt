## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Boeing Co (BA) is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide.

The cumulative return of BA is -3.49%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 122.83%.  This represents a significant underperformance of BA compared to the market benchmark. The provided relative divergence of -126.3 indicates BA's performance is substantially below the S&P 500's performance over the measured period, falling within the bottom 6.4% of the historical range of relative performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $178.5
* **5-day Moving Average:** $173.78
* **20-day Moving Average:** $173.66
* **60-day Moving Average:** $161.27

The closing price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. However, it's still below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term downtrend.  The daily price change of $2.12 (+1.21%) shows a recent small positive move.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.47 (slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.0984 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.2 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -933.7% (This is an extremely negative figure and likely indicates an error in the data or calculation.  It's crucial to verify the source and methodology for this expected return.)

The positive short-term relative divergence change suggests a recent price increase, consistent with the price movement analysis.  The negative PPO and relatively low RSI, however, point to weak overall momentum. The extremely negative expected return (-933.7%) needs further investigation and is likely flawed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue         |

There's a duplicate entry for October 29th, 2024.  Excluding the duplicate, EPS shows some minor fluctuation, but revenue remains relatively stable around $25 Billion.  A more detailed analysis requires further investigation and clarification of the duplicated data.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B     | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B     | 7.29%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B     | 11.32%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B     | 12.25%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $18.10B     | 6.44%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity      | ROE           |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | -$23.55B    | 26.20%        |
| 2024-06-30 | -$17.98B    | 8.01%         |
| 2024-03-31 | -$17.01B    | 2.02%         |
| 2023-12-31 | -$17.23B    | 0.13%         |
| 2023-09-30 | -$16.73B    | 9.78%         |

The financial statements reveal significant volatility in both revenue and profitability.  The negative equity figures require careful examination and understanding of the accounting methods used.  Profit margins are inconsistent, and a large negative profit margin in Q3 2024 is a significant concern.  Similarly, the highly variable ROE across quarters indicates unstable profitability.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, showing a substantial underperformance.  While recent price action suggests some short-term upward momentum, the overall trend appears bearish, supported by a negative PPO.  Financial statements show considerable inconsistency and volatility in revenue, profit margins, and ROE, raising serious concerns about the company's financial health.  The provided expected return is suspect and requires validation.  Further investigation into the cause of the extremely negative expected return and the duplicate data point in the earnings report is necessary before drawing any firm conclusions.  Significant caution is warranted before investing in BA.  The negative equity figures are particularly concerning and warrant a thorough review of the company's financial statements and strategy.
