While early periods (2015-2019) showed strong growth, more recent periods (2018-2025) are marked by negative CAGR, high maximum drawdowns (MDD), and negative alpha.  The negative alpha indicates underperformance relative to the market risk-free rate. The beta values, generally below 1, suggest lower volatility than the market, but this hasn't translated into positive returns.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 216.08
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 216.125
    *   Previous Close: 223.33
    *   Change: -3.23
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day MA: 218.96
    *   20-day MA: 216.83
    *   60-day MA: 222.69

**Analysis:** The recent price action shows a decline. The price is below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a short-term and medium-term downtrend. The negative change from the previous close (-3.23) confirms this bearish sentiment.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 39.12 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.39
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (450 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-06)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.6 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3152.4%

**Analysis:** The RSI of 39.12 is nearing oversold territory, suggesting a potential for a short-term bounce. However, the negative change in relative divergence and the extremely negative expected return are alarming. The MRI is high(0.9), but other indicators point to significant underlying issues, contradicting the MRI’s recommendation. The significant negative 'change' value in the "Last Market Data" section shows a considerable drop, potentially influencing short-term sentiment. The Hybrid Signal suggests buying, driven by the high MRI. However, consider the other weak indicators before making an investment decision.
