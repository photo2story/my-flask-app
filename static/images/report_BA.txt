**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 97.0%  | 67.9% | 68.0%   | 0.0    | 233.9  |

| 2019-2021  | -63.0% | 82.3% | -110.0% | 1.1    | 159.7  |
| 2020-2022  | -42.0% | 82.3% | -41.0%  | 1.0    | 151.1  |
| 2021-2023  | -2.0%  | 74.5% | -4.0%   | 0.3    | 206.8  |
| 2022-2024  | -39.0% | 74.5% | -60.0%  | 0.4    | 140.4  |
| 2023-2025  | -14.0% | 73.7% | -79.0%  | 0.3    | 169.8  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows mixed performance.  Strong growth in the earlier periods (2015-2019) but significant declines in subsequent periods. The later years show negative CAGR, meaning the investment lost value.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD values across all periods, indicating significant risk and volatility. Investors experienced substantial peak-to-trough declines in their investment.
*   **Alpha:**  Positive alpha in the earlier periods suggests outperformance relative to the benchmark (although a Beta of 0 suggests a miscalculation). The consistently negative alpha in recent periods (2018-2025) indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are relatively low, suggesting that Boeing's price movements have been less volatile than the overall market.  However, the Beta spiked in 2019-2021. A rising beta means that the stock is moving with the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization):** The Market Cap declined significantly from the 2017-2019 period to 2022-2024, reflecting the company's struggles.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 214.08
*   **Last-Market Price:** 216.84
*   **Previous Close:** 214.08
*   **Change:** 1.29
*   **5-day SMA:** 208.178
*   **20-day SMA:** 199.1971
*   **60-day SMA:** 204.95

**Analysis:** The current price is above all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which could indicate short-term upward momentum. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA; further indicating positive momentum. The recent price change of 1.29 indicates some fluctuation.

**3) Technical Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 64.88
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.9163
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 2.0 (+) Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return (%):** -610.4

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests a moderate level of risk, implying a degree of confidence in the stock's potential.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 64.88 suggests that the stock is approaching overbought territory, but not quite there yet.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, confirming the upward momentum suggested by the SMAs.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal suggests a fully invested position with a small monthly addition, classifying it as "Very Safe" with a high MRI.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The positive change indicates a recent increase in divergence from the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is alarming. It suggests that, based on the model used, long-term investment in Boeing is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Headlines:** Several news articles highlight positive developments, including a price hike from JPMorgan, a new NASA co-project, and reasons for the stock's upward trading.
*   **FAA and Cash Flow Concerns:** One article mentions FAA decisions, a 777F emissions waiver, and debate about the 2026 cash-flow turnaround.
*   **Leadership Change:** The departure of the United Launch Alliance CEO is noted.
*   **Institutional Holding:** Perkins Coie Trust Co's holding of Boeing stock is mentioned.

**Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. While positive headlines might be driving short-term gains, the article highlighting FAA decisions and cash flow concerns suggests underlying challenges remain. The CEO departure could introduce uncertainty.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.59 (~Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 24
*   **Target Price:** 244.54 (avg) / 285.00 (high) / 150.00 (low)

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus is positive, with a "Buy" rating and an average target price significantly above the current price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates a degree of uncertainty among analysts. The data on recent ratings changes is missing, so it's hard to say if there is momentum in the consensus ratings.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue   |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-10-31 | 1.08 | 28.09 B$  |
| 2025-07-31 | 0.9  | 26.46 B$  |
| 2025-04-30 | 0.91 | 27.37 B$  |
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | 25.34 B$  |
| 2025-10-31 | 0.82 | 25.34 B$  |

**Analysis:** The data is flawed because two rows have the same date and data, and there is no date listed for 2025-10-29. Disregarding these flaws, we can see that the trend for EPS and revenue is positive between 2024-10-29 and 2025-10-31.
