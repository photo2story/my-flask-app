**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Boeing Co. (BA) is an aerospace company that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, helicopters, and missiles.  The provided data shows BA's cumulative return at -2.35% significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.39%. The difference is a substantial -120.7%, placing it at the 8.4th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent performance over the years, with periods of high CAGR followed by significant declines. The relatively constant beta of 0.3 indicates low correlation with the market, implying that the stock's price movements are less sensitive to overall market fluctuations. However, the negative alpha values in several years suggest underperformance against the market.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $179.10
* **20-day Moving Average:** $167.59
* **60-day Moving Average:** $156.38

* **PPO:** 0.62 - Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.7 -  Indicates a recent slight weakening of the upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -684.8% - This extremely negative figure suggests a very low probability of outperforming the S&P 500 over the long term based on historical data and current indicators.  This needs to be critically evaluated, as such a drastic negative expectation is unlikely to be accurate.
