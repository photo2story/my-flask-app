**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $176.26
* **Last Market Price:** $185.46 (+$1.41 change from previous close)  This indicates a recent price increase.
* **5-day Moving Average:** $166.48
* **20-day Moving Average:** $160.11
* **60-day Moving Average:** $168.90

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, the recent increase should be viewed in context with the longer-term underperformance.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **MRI:** 0.4053 (Medium Risk) indicates moderate market volatility.
* **RSI:** 66.41 (slightly above neutral; not overbought but approaching the overbought zone).
* **PPO:** 1.58 (positive value suggesting bullish momentum).
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** +0.3 (Short-term upward trend).
* **Expected Return:** -661.7%  This extremely negative expected return suggests a highly pessimistic outlook for BA's future performance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon (2+ years). The recent price increase of $1.41 is a short-term fluctuation and doesn't significantly alter the overall negative outlook.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출       |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-04-30 | $0.91 | $27.37 B   |
| 2024-10-29 | $0.82 | $25.34 B   |
| 2024-07-30 | $0.83 | $25.38 B   |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.77 | $25.82 B   |
| 2025-04-30 | $0.77 | $25.82 B   |

There's a slight increase in EPS and revenue in recent quarters, but the data is inconsistent and doesn't show a clear upward trend.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this improvement.  Note the apparent duplication of data for 2025-04-30.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31  | $19.50B    | 12.40%        |
| 2024-12-31  | $15.24B    | -10.43%       |

| 2024-06-30  | $16.87B    | 7.29%         |
| 2024-03-31  | $16.57B    | 11.32%        |

Profit margins fluctuate significantly, with periods of both profitability and substantial losses.  This volatility is concerning.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE           |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31  | $-3.33B    | 1.11%         |
| 2024-12-31  | $-3.91B    | 98.90%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $-23.55B   | 26.20%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $-17.98B   | 8.01%         |
| 2024-03-31  | $-17.01B   | 2.02%         |

Negative equity values throughout the period highlight significant financial challenges.  ROE is also highly volatile, indicating inconsistent profitability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing (BA) demonstrates a high-risk, high-volatility profile. While recent earnings show some improvement and short-term price action is positive, the long-term performance significantly lags the S&P 500. Negative expected return, significant negative equity, volatile profit margins, and inconsistent ROE all point towards substantial financial challenges.  The extremely negative long-term expected return (-661.7%) strongly suggests that BA is not a suitable investment for a long-term, S&P 500-relative outperformance strategy.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering any investment in BA.  The provided data alone indicates significant risk.
