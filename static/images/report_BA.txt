## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Boeing Co (BA), a major aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling airplanes and defense products, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The cumulative return for BA is -7.49%, while the S&P 500's is 118.37%. This represents a substantial divergence of -125.9%, placing it at the 6.5th percentile of the historical range of divergence (minimum -143.9%, maximum 133.2%).  The provided CAGR data shows periods of strong performance followed by significant declines, highlighting the volatility associated with BA.  The consistently low beta of 0.2 suggests that BA's price movements are less sensitive to overall market fluctuations than the S&P 500.  However, the negative alpha values in several periods indicate underperformance compared to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $171.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $168.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $173.57
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $160.33

The current price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting potential short-term downward pressure.  The price is, however, above the 5-day and significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating some positive momentum over the longer term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 32.37 - This indicates that the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce.
* **PPO:** -0.83 -  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** -2.4 - This indicates a recent short-term decline in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** -916.5% - This exceptionally negative expected return is highly concerning and warrants further investigation.  It likely reflects the substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The extremely low number suggests potential model inaccuracies or extreme pessimism.  Long-term (2+ years) investment requires considering the potential for recovery and diversification within the portfolio.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue          |
|------------|---------|-----------------|
| 2024-10-29 | $0.82   | $25.34 Billion   |
| 2024-07-30 | $0.83   | $25.38 Billion   |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.77   | $25.82 Billion   |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.91   | $25.17 Billion   |
| 2024-10-29 | $0.91   | $25.17 Billion   |

There appears to be a duplication in the data for October 29, 2024.  Excluding the duplicate, recent earnings show relatively stable revenue with a slight downward trend in EPS. This requires further analysis to assess the underlying drivers and their impact on future performance.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B    | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B    | 7.29%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B    | 11.32%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B    | 12.25%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $18.10B    | 6.44%         |

Significant variability in profit margins suggests operational challenges or cyclical factors influencing profitability. The negative profit margin in Q3 2024 is a major concern.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE            |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B   | 26.20%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B   | 8.01%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B   | 2.02%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B   | 0.13%         |
| 2023-09-30 | $-16.73B   | 9.78%         |

Negative equity throughout the period is a critical issue that needs further investigation.  While ROE fluctuates, the negative equity significantly impacts the interpretation of this metric.


**7. Overall Summary:**

Boeing's recent performance has been significantly disappointing, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. While some technical indicators (RSI) suggest potential short-term upside, the negative PPO, large negative expected return, and concerning financial figures (negative equity, volatile profit margins) paint a bearish picture.  The substantial negative equity warrants careful scrutiny.  Further in-depth analysis is needed to determine whether the current valuation reflects the inherent risks and future prospects of the company.  The exceptionally negative expected return should be viewed with skepticism; independent verification and sensitivity analysis of the underlying model are critical.  A long-term investment strategy requires careful consideration of the significant risks involved.
