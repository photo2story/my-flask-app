**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Boeing Co designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, and missiles worldwide.

*   **Simple Numbers:**

    *   BA Cumulative Return: 5.47%

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is highly volatile, showing strong growth in earlier periods (2015-2019) followed by significant declines in recent years. This indicates a period of initial success followed by substantial challenges.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, ranging from 67.9% to 82.3%. This signifies significant risk and large potential losses during these periods.
*   **Alpha:** The alpha values are mostly negative in recent years, indicating underperformance relative to the market. Earlier periods show positive alpha, suggesting better performance.
*   **Beta:** The beta values are relatively low (around 0.2-0.4) in most periods, with a notable increase to 1.0 and 1.1 in 2019-2022. This suggests that the stock's volatility relative to the market has increased in recent years, potentially indicating higher sensitivity to market movements during that time.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization of Boeing has fluctuated, showing an initial increase followed by a decline, and then a partial recovery. This reflects the company's varying financial performance and market sentiment over the years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Simple Numbers:**

    *   Close: 216.44
    *   Last Market Change: -0.79
    *   5-day SMA: 216.47
    *   20-day SMA: 206.20
    *   60-day SMA: 204.99

*   **Analysis:**

    *   The stock closed slightly down at 216.44, with a minor change of -0.79.
    *   The 5-day SMA (216.47) is very close to the closing price, suggesting the short-term trend is relatively stable.
    *   The 20-day SMA (206.20) and 60-day SMA (204.99) are below the current price, suggesting a recent upward trend as the price is above the moving averages for the past 20 and 60 days.

**3) RSI, PPO and other indicators**

*   **Simple Numbers:**

    *   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
    *   RSI: 71.49 (Overbought)
    *   PPO: 0.86
    *   Hybrid Signal: Buy 100% of cash (5 shares)
    *   Recent Divergence Change: 2.0 (+) (Short-term Increase)
    *   Expected Return: -610.4%

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI:**  The MRI of 1.0 suggests that, according to this indicator, the market conditions are highly favorable for investment. However, this should be considered in conjunction with other indicators and the overall context.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI of 71.49 indicates that the stock is currently overbought, which could suggest a potential pullback or correction in the near term.
    *   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 0.86 indicates the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, suggesting an upward trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:**  The signal to "Buy 100% of cash" indicates a potentially bullish outlook, but it's crucial to understand the methodology behind this signal. The recommended purchase of only 5 shares, coupled with the "Very Safe" designation and the relatively low monthly investment amount, suggests a conservative approach.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The positive change of 2.0 in relative divergence indicates a recent short-term increase in the stock's performance relative to its comparison.
    *   **Expected Return:** A very negative expected return of -610.4% suggests that long-term investments from the current point may underperform significantly compared to the S&P 500. This needs to be carefully considered, especially if the investment horizon is long-term (2+ years).

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Boeing's current situation is complex and presents a mixed picture:

*   **Underperformance:** Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the expected return is extremely negative.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Technical indicators like RSI suggest the stock is currently overbought and may be due for a pullback. However, the PPO indicates a recent upward trend.
*   **Financial Health:** Boeing faces serious financial challenges, including negative equity and volatile profit margins. The company's debt levels and cash flow generation are important factors to consider.
*   **Recent Earnings:** Recent earnings and revenue have shown improvement, which could be a positive sign.
*   **News and Events:** The news highlights both positive developments (e.g., defense contracts, potential stock split) and challenges (e.g., 777X delays).
*   **Analyst Opinion:** Analysts generally have a positive outlook on the stock, but the wide range of target prices indicates uncertainty.
*   **Risk Assessment:** The MRI suggests the market is favorable for investment. However, this should be weighed against other indicators and the company's financial situation, as there are also indicators suggesting high risk.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the negative equity, volatile profit margins, underperformance relative to the S&P 500, overbought RSI, and extremely negative expected return, a cautious approach to investing in Boeing is warranted.

*   **Consider Waiting for a Pullback:** Given the overbought RSI, it might be prudent to wait for a pullback before considering an entry.
*   **Monitor Financial Health:** Closely monitor Boeing's financial performance, particularly its ability to improve its equity position and generate consistent profits.
*   **Diversification:** Ensure that Boeing represents only a small portion of your overall portfolio to mitigate the risks.
*   **Avoid long-term positions:** Based on the current data and analysis, a long-term investment in Boeing does not appear to be viable at the present time.
