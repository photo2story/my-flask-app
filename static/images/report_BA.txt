## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Report

This report analyzes Boeing Co (BA), a major aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling airplanes, helicopters, and related products and services.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Boeing's cumulative return (-27.44%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 71.02%.  The difference is -98.5%, placing it in the 13.6th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-130.2% to 102.7%).

The provided alpha and beta data show significant volatility in performance relative to the market (beta varies widely) and inconsistent alpha (outperformance relative to the market), ranging from highly positive to highly negative. This suggests BA's returns are not consistently explained by market movements alone and may be subjected to company-specific factors.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some variability in EPS and revenue, with slight recent declines.  More data points would be necessary to draw robust conclusions.  The apparent duplicate entry for 2024-10-29 needs clarification.

| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B    | -10.43%       |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's stock is currently performing significantly below the S&P 500.  The company faces challenges indicated by negative profit margins and significant negative equity.  While some short-term technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, the larger trend is bearish.  The extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 needs further clarification regarding its calculation.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough due diligence process, including a review of the company's financial statements and future outlook, is highly recommended.  The provided data alone does not provide sufficient basis for a confident investment recommendation.
