*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is highly volatile, and the unusually high value in Q4 2024 (98.90%) is likely due to the negative equity.

**7. 종합 Analysis (Overall Summary):**

Boeing (BA) is showing mixed signals. While recent earnings and revenue have been positive, the company's stock has significantly underperformed the broader market. The negative equity and volatile profit margins are concerning. The stock appears to be overbought based on the RSI, suggesting a potential pullback. Recent news indicates the company faces ongoing challenges and market scrutiny.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the underperformance relative to the market, mixed financial signals (positive earnings, negative equity, volatile profit margins), and overbought RSI, a **hold or cautious approach is recommended.** Investors should closely monitor news and financial releases to assess the underlying drivers of the company's performance. The extremely negative expected return warrants significant caution for long-term investment. Further in-depth analysis and consideration of individual risk tolerance are essential before making any investment decisions.
