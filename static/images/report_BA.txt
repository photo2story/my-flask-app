| 2023-2025  | -31.0%  | 73.7% | -90.0%   | 0.0     | 136.6  |

**Analysis:** The table shows a concerning trend:

*   **Negative CAGR:** Recent periods (2018-2025) show significant negative Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR).
*   **High MDD:** Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Negative Alpha:** The Alpha values are largely negative, meaning Boeing has underperformed relative to its expected return based on its risk (Beta).
*   **Beta Fluctuations:** Beta fluctuates, but is generally positive, indicating correlation with the market; however, recent lower values suggest that there may be change to that in the future.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has decreased over the years reflecting decreased investor confidence

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 179.70
*   **Last Market Change:** Price: 179.70, Previous Close: 179.38, Change: 0.18
*   **5-day SMA:** 185.24
*   **20-day SMA:** 197.25
*   **60-day SMA:** 212.84

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day SMAs). This suggests a downtrend in the short to medium term. The small change on the last market day doesn't significantly alter this overall trend.

**3. RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI:** 6.02
*   **PPO:** -0.76
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (450 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-06)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.3 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -4032.2

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation based on market risk.
*   **RSI:** The extremely low RSI value (6.02) indicates a severely oversold condition, which *could* lead to a potential short-term rebound. *However, in this case, it does not mean to Buy because of other long-term indicator issues.*
*   **PPO:** Negative PPO suggests the stock is trading below its recent price range.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Hybrid Signal indicated 100% Buy, but this indicator is not sufficient enough and does not reflect the current downtrend and other long-term risks.
*   **Relative Divergence:** Short-term decline signal is further reinforcing negative market sentiment.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return strongly suggests that analysts believe that long-term investment carries significant risk.

*   **Negative Headlines Dominate:** The news headlines paint a concerning picture.
    *   "Stock Slide Continues"
    *   "BA Stock Underperforms Industry YTD"
    *   "Boeing Stock (NYSE:BA) Plunges With New Strike Post-Mortem"
    *   "Navigate Production Delays and $4.9B Cash Charge"

*   **Target Price:** Average: $245, High: $285, Low: $150

**Analysis:**

*   Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating. This contrasts with the negative performance and news sentiment.
*   The wide range in target prices suggests uncertainty among analysts.

| 2024-09-30   | $-23.55B   | 26.20%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue has fluctuated, with the latest quarter showing a decent level.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profitability is inconsistent, with some quarters showing negative margins.
*   **Equity:** Negative equity is a major concern, indicating significant financial strain. The numbers are increasing, but still need to be closely monitored.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) is high, but misleading due to the negative equity; therefore the number should be seen with caution.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Boeing (BA) presents a mixed picture, but with a cautionary overview:

*   **Underperformance:** Significantly underperforming the S&P 500.
*   **Downtrend:** Stock price is below key moving averages, indicating a downtrend.
*   **Negative Sentiment:** Recent news is predominantly negative, highlighting ongoing challenges.
*   **Financial Strain:** Negative equity is a major concern.
*   **Oversold:** RSI indicates an oversold condition, which *could* lead to a rebound.
*   **Analyst Disagreement:** While analysts have a "Buy" consensus, the wide target price range reflects uncertainty.

**Conclusion:** While some indicators (oversold RSI, slightly improved EPS and revenue) *could* suggest a potential for short-term recovery, the overriding factors are negative. The high MDD, negative Alpha, negative equity, and negative news sentiment present a significant risk. **Therefore, based on the data provided, a long-term investment in Boeing at this time appears highly risky.** Investors should exercise extreme caution and carefully weigh the potential risks against any potential rewards. The company needs to demonstrate a consistent ability to improve its profitability, strengthen its financial position, and address the ongoing operational challenges to instill investor confidence.
