## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

* **Ticker:** BA (Boeing Co.)
* **Company Overview:** Boeing Co. is a major aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling airplanes and defense systems.
* **Cumulative Return (BA):** -22.41%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 82.57%
* **Return Difference (BA vs. VOO):** -105.0%
* **Relative Divergence:** 10.5% (indicates BA's underperformance relative to VOO based on historical data)


**1. Performance Comparison (BA vs. VOO):**

Boeing significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return difference of -105.0% highlights a substantial underperformance. While the relative divergence suggests this underperformance is relatively extreme compared to its historical range, it's crucial to understand this doesn't imply future performance will follow this trend.

**2. Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta values fluctuate significantly across different periods.  High positive Alphas in 2015-2017 and 2017-2019 suggest outperformance relative to the market during those years, while consistently negative Alphas in subsequent years indicate considerable underperformance. The high Beta values consistently above 0.1, often much higher, suggest that BA's price is highly sensitive to market movements (higher risk). The fluctuating CAGR further underscores the volatility of Boeing's performance. High CAGR values are offset by substantial periods of negative returns and significant maximum drawdowns (MDD).

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue around $25-$27 billion, with EPS fluctuating between $0.77 and $0.91.  There's no clear upward or downward trend in the limited data provided.  More historical data and a longer time frame would be necessary for a robust trend analysis.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-04-30 | 0.91 | 27.37 B$ |
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | 25.34 B$ |

**6. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data severely limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This critical information is necessary to assess Boeing's profitability and financial health accurately.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has been significantly below the S&P 500 for the period analyzed. While short-term indicators show some positive momentum (moving averages, PPO), the long-term underperformance, high Beta, and negative Alpha raise considerable concerns.  The lack of comprehensive financial information prevents a complete assessment. The extremely negative expected return (-661.7%) needs clarification and investigation before any interpretation can be made.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for the underperformance (e.g., supply chain issues, 737 MAX crisis aftermath) is essential before making any investment decisions. A thorough review of the -661.7% expected return figure and the missing financial data is crucial.  This report highlights the need for more data and context before reaching any firm conclusion about Boeing's investment prospects.
