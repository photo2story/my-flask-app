**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Boeing Co. (BA) is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide.  BA's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind this underperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **BA Cumulative Return:** -4.56%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 119.91%
* **Return Difference:** -124.47% (This shows BA's significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.)
* **Relative Divergence:** -7.0% (This indicates that BA's underperformance is relatively low compared to its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500.  However, the negative value highlights continued underperformance).


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant volatility in Boeing's performance and alpha, with periods of strong outperformance and substantial underperformance relative to the market (Beta fluctuates considerably showing periods of high market sensitivity and lower sensitivity).  Noteworthy is the negative alpha and high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) in several periods, indicating substantial risk and underperformance.  The large swings in Beta suggests the company's risk profile is not consistent over time.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84 B     | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87 B     | 7.29%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity       | ROE           |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55 B    | 26.20%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98 B    | 8.01%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01 B    | 2.02%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23 B    | 0.13%         |
| 2023-09-30 | $-16.73 B    | 9.78%         |

The financial data shows significant volatility and a negative equity position in recent quarters, which is a major concern.  The negative profit margin in Q3 2024 is particularly alarming.  Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying causes of these negative financial indicators.  The high ROE in Q3 2024 is counterintuitive given the negative profit margin and negative equity, suggesting potential data inconsistencies that require further verification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, showing substantial volatility and periods of substantial losses.  Recent financial data raises serious concerns about the company's financial health, highlighting negative profit margins and negative equity. While some technical indicators point towards a potential short-term upward trend, the extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500, and the serious financial concerns raise significant red flags.  The provided data contains inconsistencies that require clarification before a comprehensive investment decision can be made.  Further investigation into the causes of the financial issues and a more detailed analysis of the earnings and financial data are crucial before forming any investment conclusion.  The -848.8% expected return figure requires thorough review and validation.
