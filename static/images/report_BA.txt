**Alpha/Beta Analysis Interpretation**

*   **CAGR:** Volatile, with strong positive growth early on followed by significant negative growth in more recent periods.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values indicate significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Predominantly negative in recent years, indicating underperformance relative to the market risk.
*   **Beta:** Generally negative, suggesting a negative correlation with the market and potentially defensive characteristics, but this is likely more indicative of company-specific issues than intentional hedging.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap has fluctuated significantly

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 229.61
*   **Previous Close:** 230.75
*   **Change:** -0.49
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 231.94
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 231.015
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 222.6232

**Interpretation:**

The stock price experienced a slight decrease. The 5-day and 20-day moving averages are close to each other. The fact that both are above the current price could indicate potential short-term resistance. The 60-day moving average being below the current price suggests a potential longer-term upward trend, but the short-term indicators suggest caution.

*   **RSI:** 42.36
*   **PPO:** -0.1888
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (4 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-02)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** 0.5 (Positive - Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1335.5%

**Interpretation:**

*   **MRI:** The Low Risk MRI suggests that the overall market risk is low at the moment.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 42.36 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A slightly negative PPO suggests the price is performing weaker than its moving averages.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal is recommending a cautious buy, with a small allocation and ongoing monthly investment. The 0% cash allocation suggests the model is very aggressive.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** A positive change in relative divergence indicates short-term upward momentum.
*   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return is alarming and indicates a very pessimistic outlook based on the model's calculations. This should be interpreted with caution.

**{ 'price': 229.61, 'previousClose': 230.75, 'change': -0.49 }** The decrease is very minimal and therefore should not cause any big issues.

**7. Overall Analysis**

Boeing's stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The company faces several challenges, including negative equity, volatile earnings, and labor issues.

*   **Positive Factors:** Strong analyst consensus, potential AI growth opportunities, defense program success.
*   **Negative Factors:** Significant underperformance vs. S&P 500, negative equity, volatile earnings, labor issues, competitive pressures, significantly negative expected return (model-based).

**Recommendation:** While analysts are optimistic, the financial situation and model-based negative expected return suggest a high-risk investment. A very small, cautious allocation might be considered, but thorough due diligence is essential.
