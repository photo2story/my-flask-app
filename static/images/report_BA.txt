## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Boeing Co. (BA) is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide.

The cumulative return for BA is -2.93%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 121.09%.  This represents a significant underperformance of BA compared to the market benchmark. The provided data shows a substantial divergence, with BA lagging significantly behind the S&P 500. The relative divergence of -124.0 indicates BA's performance is considerably below the historical range of its performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta values across different periods show highly volatile performance. While Alpha is consistently positive (0.2), indicating some outperformance relative to the market, this is overshadowed by substantial negative returns in certain periods (e.g., 2018-2021). Beta values show consistent exposure to market movements.  The significant swings in CAGR and MDD highlight the considerable risk associated with investing in BA.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $179.53
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $176.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $173.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $163.27

The price is above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The price change from the previous close (+3.38) indicates a notable positive daily movement. This could indicate a short-term bullish trend but shouldnâ€™t be taken as conclusive evidence.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.85 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.05 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, although relatively weak)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.8 (+) (Shows recent short-term upward momentum)

The recent price change of +3.38, while positive, isn't exceptionally large enough to characterize as a "sharp rebound."  The expected return of -822.3% is unrealistic and likely an error in the provided data. The extremely negative long-term expected return, compared to the S&P 500, is a significant concern.

The financial statements show significant volatility in both revenue and profitability, with negative profit margins in the most recent quarter.  The negative equity figures raise concerns about the company's financial health.  The ROE also fluctuates wildly, suggesting inconsistent profitability.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance relative to the S&P 500 is severely lagging. While short-term price action shows some positive momentum, the underlying financial health and long-term outlook remain questionable.  The highly volatile earnings, negative profit margins, and negative equity raise serious concerns.  The extremely negative expected return (-822.3%) should be treated with extreme skepticism and likely reflects an error in the data provided.  A thorough review of the provided data, including verifying the expected return and addressing the inconsistencies, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further fundamental research and analysis are absolutely necessary.  Given the current data, a long-term investment in BA, particularly relative to the S&P 500, appears highly risky.
