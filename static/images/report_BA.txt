**7.  Overall Analysis:**

Boeing currently shows considerable underperformance against the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility in both price and financial metrics.  The negative expected return, negative profit margins in the recent quarter, and substantial negative equity present significant cause for concern. While the recent price action suggests a potential upward trend, the underlying financial health of the company needs improvement.  The inconsistent earnings data requires further clarification.  Investors should proceed with caution and consider the high risk associated with BA.  A more comprehensive analysis with complete and consistent data is necessary for a confident investment decision.
