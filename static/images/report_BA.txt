### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 95.42%
*   **Absolute Divergence:** -108.2%
*   **Relative Divergence:** 5.6% (This indicates that BA's underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range relative to VOO.)

**Analysis of Provided Table:**

The table shows Boeing's performance over rolling 3-year periods. Key takeaways:

* **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown(MDD)은 특정 기간 동안의 최고점에서 최저점까지의 최대 손실을 나타냅니다. 높은 MDD는 투자 위험이 높다는 것을 의미합니다.

### 7. Overall Analysis

Based on the data provided, Boeing (BA) presents a mixed picture with significant challenges and some signs of potential recovery.

*   **Underperformance:**  BA has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a large negative cumulative return difference. The expected return suggests this trend may continue.
*   **Financial Concerns:** Negative equity and fluctuating profitability are major concerns.
*   **Recent Positives:** Recent earnings show some revenue growth, and the short-term price movement is positive.
*   **Market Sentiment:** News events indicate ongoing scrutiny and volatility.

**Recommendation:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is warranted. The negative equity, significant underperformance relative to the market, and potential for short-term decline suggest that this stock may not be suitable for risk-averse investors. A buy signal based on technical indicators is undermined by the very negative expected return, suggesting fundamental problems are not reflected in the current price action. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence and closely monitor news and company announcements before making any investment decisions.
