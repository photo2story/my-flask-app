2026-01-10 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of Boeing (BA) based on the information provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (BA vs. S&P 500)**

*   **Company Overview:** Boeing Co. is a leading global aerospace company, primarily involved in the design, manufacture, and sale of commercial jetliners, defense, space, and security systems.
*   **BA Cumulative Return:** 4.77%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 92.74%
*   **Divergence:** -86.1 (Relative Divergence: 9.6)

**Analysis:**  Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 by a very large margin. The negative divergence of -86.1 indicates a substantial gap in cumulative returns. The low relative divergence of 9.6 suggests the current divergence is near the low end of its historical range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2016-2018  | 54.0%   | 23.4%   | 50.0%   | 1.2    | 260.5  |
| 2017-2019  | 20.0%   | 23.4%   | 3.0%    | 1.2    | 263.1  |
| 2018-2020  | -75.0%  | 38.2%   | -96.0%  | 1.6    | 172.9  |
| 2019-2021  | -57.0%  | 38.2%   | -101.0% | 1.6    | 162.6  |
| 2020-2022  | -35.0%  | 54.2%   | -33.0%  | 1.6    | 153.9  |
| 2021-2023  | 1.0%    | 54.2%   | 1.0%    | 1.2    | 210.5  |
| 2022-2024  | -33.0%  | 43.8%   | -52.0%  | 1.1    | 143.0  |
| 2023-2025  | -8.0%   | 42.7%   | -70.0%  | 1.1    | 175.4  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuating significantly, with strong positive growth early on, followed by significant declines in more recent periods. This indicates volatile performance.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD), suggesting significant risk and volatility.  MDD indicates the maximum loss from peak to trough during the period.
*   **Alpha:**  The negative Alpha values, especially in recent years, show BA significantly underperforming its expected return based on its risk (Beta). This indicates poor risk-adjusted performance relative to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta is consistently above 1, meaning BA is more volatile than the market. The Beta increase during 2018-2022 indicates increased sensitivity to market movements during that period, suggesting higher market-related risk.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization fluctuated over the years, reflecting market sentiment and company performance.
The data suggests that Boeing's performance has been highly volatile and generally underperforming the market in recent years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 227.38
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 234.53, Previous Close: 227.38, Change: 3.14
*   **5-day SMA:** 228.248
*   **20-day SMA:** 215.355
*   **60-day SMA:** 205.7577

**Analysis:** The price increase from the previous close and the fact that the 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs suggests a short-term upward trend. The 20-day SMA being above the 60-day further supports this, indicating potential intermediate-term bullish momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 82.72 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.5133
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (4 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 3.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -409.0%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests moderate risk.
*   **RSI:** The high RSI (82.72) indicates the stock is overbought, which could signal a potential pullback or consolidation.
*   **PPO:** The PPO is positive, indicating that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, suggesting an upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal to buy 80% with caution, along with MRI of 0.70, confirms moderate risk.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:**  The recent increase in relative divergence indicates short-term upward momentum.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-409.0%) is a major red flag, suggesting a very pessimistic outlook for long-term investment in BA.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:**  Revenue shows an upward trend over the past five quarters.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are volatile, fluctuating between negative and positive values. The most recent quarter (2025-09-30) shows a negative profit margin (-10.21%), indicating operational losses.
*   **Equity:**  Boeing has negative equity, indicating that its liabilities exceed its assets. This is a significant concern. The equity position has improved from $-23.55B to $-8.25B.
*   **ROE:**  ROE is volatile and exceptionally high in some quarters, likely due to the negative equity base. This can be misleading since it's influenced by the negative equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Performance:** Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Risk:** The stock exhibits high volatility (Beta > 1) and substantial MDD, indicating significant risk.
*   **Technicals:** Short-term technical indicators (SMA, PPO) suggest some upward momentum, but the RSI is in overbought territory, potentially signaling a pullback.
*   **Sentiment:** Analyst ratings are generally "Buy," and recent news is somewhat positive, but the extremely negative expected return suggests caution.
*   **Financials:** Revenue shows a positive trend, but profitability is inconsistent, and the negative equity position is a significant concern.
*   **Recommendation:** Based on the provided data, a long-term investment in Boeing appears risky. While there are some positive short-term signals and improving revenue trends, the negative equity, inconsistent profitability, negative expected return, and history of underperformance warrant caution. Consider this only as a speculative trade.
