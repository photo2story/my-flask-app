### 7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)

Boeing's stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative return disparity. Technical indicators suggest the stock is currently oversold and in a downtrend. Recent news is mixed, with a large order providing a positive catalyst, but a lawsuit and negative market sentiment weighing on the stock. Analyst ratings are generally positive, but there's a wide range in target prices. Financially, Boeing has shown revenue growth, but profit margins have been inconsistent, and the company has negative equity.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the negative equity, the negative expected return, and the recent negative short term momentum, investors should be cautious and consider the high risk. While analysts are generally positive, the company has long-term issues to resolve. A conservative approach would be to wait for more consistent positive signals before considering a long-term investment.
