| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 91.0% | 10.5% | 63.0% | 0.2 | 211.5 |
| 2016-2018  | 107.0% | 8.5% | 88.0% | -0.4 | 235.8 |
| 2017-2019  | 55.0% | 12.7% | 25.0% | 0.4 | 243.7 |
| 2018-2020  | -121.0% | 45.3% | -149.0% | -0.3 | 161.1 |
| 2019-2021  | -120.0% | 45.3% | -191.0% | -0.3 | 151.5 |
| 2020-2022  | -70.0% | 45.3% | -78.0% | -0.3 | 143.3 |
| 2021-2023  | 30.0% | 24.4% | 7.0% | 0.9 | 196.1 |
| 2022-2024  | -14.0% | 24.4% | -47.0% | -0.6 | 133.2 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $178.11
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $169.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $165.68
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $173.20

The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, it's important to note that the price is still below its 60-day average, indicating that the recent price movement might be a short-term trend. The increase of 3.06 from the previous close suggests a possible short-term price recovery.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 56.60 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.30 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -481.8%  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further clarification.  The data source and calculation methodology should be reviewed.  The statement that itâ€™s the expected return from *now* for long-term investment is ambiguous. Does it mean a negative return compared to the VOO's performance over the same period, or is it a negative overall return?


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue          |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| 2024-10-29 | $0.82  | $25.34 Billion    |
| 2024-07-30 | $0.83  | $25.38 Billion    |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.77  | $25.82 Billion    |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.91  | $25.17 Billion    |
| 2024-10-29 | $0.91  | $25.17 Billion    |

There seems to be a duplicate entry for October 29th, 2024.  Revenue remains relatively stable around $25 Billion, but EPS shows some fluctuation.  A more detailed analysis including year-over-year comparisons and industry benchmarks would be needed for a complete assessment.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B    | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B    | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B    | 7.29%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B    | 11.32%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B    | 12.25%        |

Profit margins show significant volatility, swinging between substantial losses and moderate profits. This instability is a major concern.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE           |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B     | 98.90%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B    | 26.20%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B    | 8.01%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B    | 2.02%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B    | 0.13%         |

Negative equity values throughout the period are highly concerning and indicate a potentially weak financial position.  The ROE figures are also highly volatile and do not necessarily reflect true profitability given the negative equity.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has been significantly below the S&P 500, showing substantial volatility and periods of substantial losses. While recent price action indicates some short-term positive momentum, the underlying financial health, reflected in the negative profit margins, volatile ROE, and negative equity, raises significant concerns.  The long-term outlook depends heavily on the company's ability to improve its operational efficiency, resolve any outstanding issues, and regain market confidence.  The extremely negative expected return (-481.8%) needs critical review as the source and calculation method are not specified.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.  Considering the risks involved, seeking advice from a financial professional is crucial.
