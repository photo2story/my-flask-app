This report analyzes Boeing Co (BA) stock performance, financial health, and recent news, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Boeing Co is an aerospace company that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes and defense, space, and security systems globally.

The cumulative return of BA is -6.72%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 114.36%.  This represents a significant underperformance of BA compared to the market benchmark. The provided relative divergence of -121.1 indicates BA's performance is substantially below the S&P 500, falling within the 8.2 percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly volatile performance over the past several years, with significant periods of both high gains and substantial losses.  Note that the Alpha values provided are consistently at 0.2 which is highly unusual and may represent an error in the data.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $172.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $171.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $158.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $153.88

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, although the short-term 5-day moving average is only slightly below the closing price.  This is indicative of recent price growth but should be evaluated within the longer context of the volatility illustrated in section 1.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 80.54  (Overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term correction.)
* **PPO:** 1.18 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.1 (Indicates a short-term upward trend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0% (This suggests that, based on the provided data, long-term investment in BA is not expected to outperform the S&P 500. However, this should be treated with caution considering the inherent limitations of such long-term predictions).

The high RSI value suggests the stock is currently overbought and may be prone to a correction. The positive PPO and the increase in relative divergence indicate short-term upward momentum.  The reported expected return of 0% should be interpreted carefully.  Without the modeling details, this value alone does not provide substantial information.
