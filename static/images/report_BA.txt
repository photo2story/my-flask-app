**1. Performance Comparison:**

Boeing Co (BA) is an American multinational aerospace and defense corporation.  Over the analyzed period, BA significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of -25.27% compared to VOO's 121.84%. The substantial difference of -147.11% highlights BA's poor relative performance. The relative divergence of -122.1 indicates that BA's performance is far below the historical range compared to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance across different years.  While some periods exhibited high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and positive alpha, others reveal significant negative returns and substantial maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements. Notably, the periods 2018-2021 show extremely negative CAGR and alpha, likely reflecting the impact of factors such as the 737 MAX grounding.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows fluctuation as well.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($184.42) is above the 5-day ($183.42) and 20-day ($178.80) moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  However, it remains below the 60-day moving average ($169.45), indicating a longer-term bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 62.45 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, implying neutral momentum. The PPO of 0.22 indicates a slightly positive momentum.  The recent negative relative divergence (-0.6) points to a short-term bearish trend. The extremely negative expected return (-746.4%) suggests substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This extreme negative value warrants further investigation into the underlying assumptions and data used to generate this estimate.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-29 | $0.82  | $25.34 B      |
| 2024-07-30 | $0.83  | $25.38 B      |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.77  | $25.82 B      |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.91  | $25.17 B      |
| 2024-10-29 | $0.91  | $25.17 B      |

There appears to be a duplicated entry for 2024-10-29.  Excluding the duplicate, EPS shows slight fluctuation with a general downward trend in recent quarters.  Revenue remains relatively stable around $25 billion.  More detailed analysis requires additional data (e.g., year-over-year comparisons).

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis. This lack of crucial information significantly limits the ability to assess the company's financial health and profitability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's stock performance has significantly lagged behind the S&P 500, exhibiting substantial volatility and negative returns in recent years.  While short-term indicators show some signs of recovery, the long-term outlook remains uncertain, especially given the highly negative projected return compared to the S&P 500.  The lack of comprehensive financial data further hinders a complete assessment.  A thorough investigation into the causes of the underperformance, including the 737 MAX issues and broader market conditions, is crucial before forming any investment decisions.  The significant negative expected return necessitates a cautious approach.  Further research and analysis are needed to validate the reported expected return figure.
