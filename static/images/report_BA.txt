| 2023-2025  | -13.0%  | 73.7%   | -75.0%  | 0.1  | 163.0  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Shows periods of high growth (early years) followed by significant declines.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate substantial risk and volatility.  Investors experienced large losses during the down periods.
*   **Alpha:**  The negative Alpha values across most periods suggest underperformance relative to the expected return based on market risk.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values are generally low, indicating that Boeing's price movements are not highly correlated with the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has fluctuated significantly over time.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movements**

*   **Current Price:** 215.56
*   **Previous Close:** 210.73
*   **Change:** 2.29
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 217.18
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 216.40
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 225.24

**Analysis:**

The stock price closed higher than the previous day, indicating a positive change. The 5-day and 20-day moving averages are very close, suggesting a relatively stable trend in the short term.  However, the current price is below the 60-day moving average, which could indicate a potential downward trend in the medium term. The price increase of 2.29 today is a decent jump, suggesting a potential short-term positive catalyst.

**3. Technical Indicators & Risk Assessment**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 50.31
*   **PPO:** 0.031
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (450 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -1.1 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3772.5

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:**  An RSI of 50.31 indicates a neutral condition, with neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The PPO is near zero, meaning that the moving averages are very close together, it's hard to infer anything from that.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends using 100% of available cash to buy Boeing shares, aligning with a "Very Safe" investment strategy. This signal is based on an MRI of 0.90.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:**  The negative change in relative divergence suggests a recent short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:**  The significantly negative expected return is highly concerning and indicates that, based on the model, a long-term investment in Boeing could severely underperform the S&P 500.  This is a critical red flag.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Trump Threatens Controls On Boeing China Parts:**  This introduces geopolitical and supply chain risk.
*   **Boeing, Leonardo Partner for US Army Flight School Next Contract:** Positive news indicating potential future revenue.
*   **Airlines Face More Than $11 Billion in Extra Costs Amid Supply Challenges, IATA Says:**  This negatively impacts Boeing's customers, potentially delaying or reducing aircraft orders.
*   **BAE Systems (LSE:BA.) Valuation:**  This is news about a competitor; while not directly impacting Boeing, it's useful for competitive analysis.
*   **Boeing Stock Rises 41.4% in a Year: What Should Investors Do Now?:** Positive headline.
*   **Boeing Uses Digital Form 8130-3 in Industry-First Shipment:** Positive for efficiency and modernization.

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed.  Geopolitical risk (China parts), supply chain issues for airlines, and broader economic headwinds are concerns. However, the partnership with Leonardo and the progress with digital forms are positive signals.  The news of the stock rising significantly in the past year needs to be viewed in the context of the longer-term underperformance highlighted earlier.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.56 (~Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 22
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 252.95 / 287.00 / 150.00

**Analysis:**

Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating with a target price significantly above the current price. However, there is a wide range in target prices, indicating uncertainty. The lack of recent rating changes data makes it hard to know if the analysts have shifted or are shifting opinion.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출         |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2025-07-31 | 0.9   | 26.46 B$     |
| 2025-04-30 | 0.91  | 27.37 B$     |

| 2025-07-31 | 0.83  | 25.38 B$     |

**Analysis:**

The EPS has been relatively stable, around 0.8 to 0.91, suggesting steady profitability (although it's important to compare this to previous years). Revenue has shown some fluctuation, but is generally in the 25-27 Billion range. The repeated date 2025-07-31 with different numbers needs to be checked to confirm which number is correct and which one is duplicate.

**6. Financial Information**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30   | $22.75B  | 10.70%        |

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-06-30   | $-3.29B   | 18.54%    |

| 2024-09-30   | $-23.55B  | 26.20%    |
| 2024-06-30   | $-17.98B  | 8.01%     |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue has fluctuated quarter to quarter, but appears to be on an upward trend more recently.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have varied significantly, with negative margins in two of the last five quarters. This is a concern.
*   **Equity:** The company has negative equity, which is a significant red flag indicating that liabilities exceed assets.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) is positive but volatile, influenced by the negative equity position. The high ROE values need to be interpreted cautiously given the negative equity.

**7. Overall Summary**

Based on the provided data, Boeing presents a mixed picture with significant cause for concern.

*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   Substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   High volatility and Maximum Drawdown (MDD).
    *   Negative Alpha values, indicating underperformance relative to market risk.
    *   Negative Equity, a major financial concern.
    *   Fluctuating revenue and profit margins, with recent negative margins.
    *   Geopolitical and supply chain risks highlighted in recent news.
    *   Extremely Negative Expected Return based on the model.

*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   Recent positive stock price movement.
    *   Analyst consensus rating of "Buy" (although with a wide range in target prices).
    *   Recent Partnership with Leonardo and progress in the industry.
    *   Hybrid Signal - Buy Signal.

**Conclusion:**

While analysts may be optimistic and the recent price action is positive, the fundamental data raises serious concerns about Boeing's financial health and long-term performance. The negative equity, underperformance relative to the market, and negative expected return warrant significant caution. Investors should carefully weigh these risks before investing in Boeing.
