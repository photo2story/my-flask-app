The table shows significant volatility in CAGR, with periods of strong growth followed by substantial declines.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $161.9
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $158.00
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $162.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $169.52

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  The recent price increase from the previous close of $156.47 to $161.9 indicates a 3.47% increase, which could be considered a moderate uptick.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.95 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** 0.3565 (Slightly positive momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -639.6%  This extremely negative expected return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a significant red flag.


The recent price increase (3.47%) suggests a potential short-term rebound, but the negative expected return casts doubt on long-term prospects.  The RSI nearing oversold conditions suggests potential for a bounce, while the positive PPO hints at some positive momentum.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue        |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | $25.34 B       |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.83 | $25.38 B       |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.77 | $25.82 B       |
| 2023-10-31 | 0.91 | $25.17 B       |
| 2024-10-29 | 0.91 | $25.17 B       |

Note: There's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-29. Assuming this is an error, the data show relatively stable revenue but slightly fluctuating EPS.  Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the fluctuation and duplicate entry.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B   | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B   | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B   | 7.29%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B   | 11.32%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B   | 12.25%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE           |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B    | 98.90%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B   | 26.20%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B   | 8.01%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B   | 2.02%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B   | 0.13%        |

Both revenue and profitability show significant volatility. Negative profit margins in the last two quarters are concerning.  Negative equity figures also raise significant concerns about the company's financial health.  The high ROE figures in some quarters might be misleading given the negative equity.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Boeing's performance is currently significantly lagging the S&P 500, showing considerable underperformance.  While some short-term positive indicators exist (recent price increase, RSI approaching oversold), the overwhelmingly negative long-term expected return, volatile financial performance (negative profit margins, negative equity), and consistently negative alpha suggest a high-risk investment.  Further investigation into the causes of the negative profit margins and negative equity is crucial before considering any investment.  The provided data strongly indicates a bearish outlook for Boeing in the long term.
