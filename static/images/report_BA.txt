**7. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing Co. (BA) presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.  While short-term price movements show some positive signs, the long-term performance has been significantly below the S&P 500.  The company displays inconsistent financial performance with erratic revenue, profit margins, and substantial negative equity.  The highly volatile nature of the stock, coupled with the inconsistent financial health, suggests a cautious approach to investment.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent performance changes and an examination of any news impacting the company's financial condition are necessary before making any investment decisions. The lack of readily available context (missing relative strength data and analyst opinions) severely limits the analysis.
