**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $170.57
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $171.52
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $174.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $159.53

The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 34.17 (below 30 often suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.88 (negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.6 (indicates short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -669.8% (This extremely negative figure needs further clarification. It's likely an error or represents a highly pessimistic scenario.  Further analysis is required to understand the methodology used to calculate this value).


The RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, while the PPO confirms bearish momentum.  The positive relative divergence change suggests a short-term upward trend; however, this needs to be considered in the context of the overall negative trend.  The extremely negative expected return requires further investigation and context.  A price of $170.57 doesn't automatically indicate a sharp upward or downward move; the context of the broader market and company news is crucial.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|

| 2024-10-29 | $0.91 | $25.17B       | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*

There seems to be a duplicate entry for October 29, 2024.  Revenue shows relative stability around $25 Billion, but EPS fluctuates.  A more detailed analysis requires reviewing the full financial statements to understand the drivers of these fluctuations (e.g., one-time charges, changes in production costs).


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B     | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B     | 7.29%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B     | 11.32%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B     | 12.25%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $18.10B     | 6.44%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE           |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B    | 26.20%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B    | 8.01%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B    | 2.02%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B    | 0.13%         |
| 2023-09-30 | $-16.73B    | 9.78%         |


The financial data shows significant volatility in both revenue and profitability.  The negative equity figures are concerning and require further investigation into the company's balance sheet and capital structure.  The high ROE in Q3 2024 is counterintuitive given the large negative equity; this requires deeper analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has been significantly below the S&P 500,  showing considerable volatility. While some technical indicators suggest potential oversold conditions, the overall trend is bearish.  The financial data reveals inconsistent profitability and a worrisome negative equity position.  The extremely negative expected return reported needs further explanation.  Before investing, a thorough examination of the company's financial health, future order book, and the overall macroeconomic environment is critical.  Further investigation is needed to clarify inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate earnings data, extremely negative expected return).  A long-term investment strategy should only be considered after addressing these concerns and conducting comprehensive due diligence.
