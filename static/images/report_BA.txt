This report analyzes Boeing Co (BA), a major aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling airplanes and defense products.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Boeing's cumulative return (-18.15%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 89.44%.  The divergence is substantial (-107.6%), placing it at the 8.3rd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a normalized scale of 0-100).

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows fluctuating performance relative to the market.  While periods of high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) were observed (e.g., 90% and 93% in 2015-2017 and 2016-2018 respectively), subsequent periods displayed substantial negative returns (-116% and -111%).  The beta values are generally high, indicating significant market sensitivity.  The recent periods (2022-2025) show significantly negative CAGR but a fluctuating alpha, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance compared to the market.  Market capitalization fluctuates substantially over the observed periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **5-day Moving Average:** $173.95
* **20-day Moving Average:** $166.91
* **60-day Moving Average:** $173.03

The price is currently below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, it is above the 20-day moving average, indicating some potential short-term support.  The recent price drop is relatively small.

* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -1.5 (indicating a short-term weakening trend)
* **Expected Return:** -646.0% (This extremely negative figure requires further clarification.  It likely represents an unusually large projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a longer period and needs review in terms of methodology and assumptions.)

| 2023-12-31 | -$17.23 Billion| 0.13%        |

The financial data shows significant volatility in profitability and negative equity.  The high ROE figures in some quarters despite negative equity require further investigation to understand the accounting methodology.  The substantial drop in revenue in the last two quarters is concerning.

**6. Overall Summary:**

Boeing's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While periods of strong growth have been observed, these were followed by significant declines.  The companyâ€™s recent financial performance reveals volatility and negative profitability in recent quarters.  The extremely negative projected return (-646%) warrants serious scrutiny and likely reflects an exceptionally pessimistic outlook. The current price is near its 20-day moving average, but below its 5-day and 60-day averages, indicating potential short-term bearish momentum. Further analysis is necessary to understand the discrepancies in the provided data and clarify the exceptionally negative projected return figure.  Before making any investment decisions, investors should conduct thorough due diligence, examining the underlying reasons for the financial volatility and carefully assessing the long-term prospects of the company.
