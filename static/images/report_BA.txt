## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Boeing Co. (BA) is a major aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling aircraft, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, and missiles worldwide.

The cumulative return of BA (-8.68%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference is a substantial -125.1%, placing it at the 6.8th percentile of the historical range of performance differences between BA and VOO.  This indicates BA's performance has lagged far behind the market benchmark.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility, with periods of strong growth followed by substantial losses.  The recent years (2022-2025) show negative or low CAGR, highlighting consistent underperformance.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures further emphasize the risk associated with investing in BA.  A relatively constant beta of 0.2 suggests BA's price movements are less volatile than the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $168.89
* **Last Market Price:** $168.92
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $168.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $173.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $160.14

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor downward trend in the very short term.  It is significantly below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a more pronounced downward trend over the medium to long term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 29.26 (Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.)
* **PPO:** -1.00 (Indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.9 (Confirms short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** -871.7% (This extremely negative figure likely reflects the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 and should be interpreted cautiously.  It is not a reliable prediction of future performance.)

The current price ($168.92) is not significantly different from the recent averages, so there is no indication of a dramatic price swing (neither a sharp rebound nor a crash).  The extremely negative expected return underscores the considerable risk associated with BA at this time. The negative expected return is likely tied to the historical underperformance against the S&P 500 and should be treated with skepticism, given its magnitude and unrealistic expectation.  Long-term investment requires a thorough re-evaluation of the risks and potential upside in the face of such negative projections.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

A more detailed financial statement analysis would be needed to draw stronger conclusions.

| 2024-06-30  | $-17.98       | 8.01    |

| 2023-09-30  | $-16.73       | 9.78    |

The negative equity in several quarters is a significant red flag.  Profit margins are erratic, swinging from positive to deeply negative.  ROE also exhibits considerable variability.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the negative expected return and volatile financial performance raise serious concerns.  Negative equity and erratic profitability are major warning signs.  While the stock may be considered cheap based on the RSI, the fundamental weaknesses require a very cautious approach.  Further in-depth research including industry analysis and a detailed examination of Boeing's long-term strategic plans is needed before any investment decision is made. The extremely high negative expected return should be treated with extreme skepticism.
