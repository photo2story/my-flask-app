## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Boeing Co (BA) is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and other aerospace and defense products and services.

BA's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is -123.8%, meaning BA underperformed the S&P 500 by a substantial margin.  The provided relative divergence of -7.3% indicates that this underperformance is relatively low compared to its historical range of underperformance against the S&P 500.  However, this relative measure should be interpreted cautiously as it is contingent upon the historical range of performance.

The provided CAGR data shows periods of significant gains and losses, highlighting the volatility inherent in BA's stock performance. The consistently low Beta (around 0.2) suggests lower than average correlation with the overall market, although this alone does not completely explain the large negative alpha values observed in several periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $179.34
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $176.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $164.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $155.48

The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the 20 and 60-day moving averages might indicate a recent price surge.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 84.12 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction might be imminent.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.86 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.4 –  Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% –  This suggests that, based on available data, there’s no significant expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is heavily dependent on the provided data's accuracy and limitations.  The 0% return is more likely to be considered as a reflection of the current uncertainty about BA's future rather than a precise prediction of returns.

Given the current price of $179.34 and the significant divergence from moving averages, there's a possibility of a recent rapid price increase.  Further investigation into the catalysts for this increase is required.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-10-29).  Excluding the duplicate, the data reveals:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between $25B and $26B over the past few quarters.  There's no clear upward or downward trend.
* **EPS:** EPS has fluctuated, showing no clear consistent trend.  There's significant variability between quarters, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the overall trend without additional context and understanding of the specific factors involved.

Without access to expected earnings, it's impossible to assess whether the reported numbers represent "beats" or "misses."

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is inconsistent, and profit margins have swung dramatically between positive and strongly negative figures.  This erratic performance raises concerns about Boeing's financial stability and predictability.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Negative equity values are concerning, indicating a situation of net liabilities exceeding assets.  ROE (Return on Equity) also shows significant variability and periods of negative or near-zero return, reflecting the difficulties and financial risks inherent in the company's recent performance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's stock performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative cumulative return. Although short-term indicators suggest upward momentum, the high RSI suggests overbought conditions, raising concerns about a potential correction.  Financial statements reveal inconsistencies in revenue and profit margins, negative equity, and highly variable ROE.  The long-term outlook is uncertain, and the 0% expected return reflects the current uncertainty and challenges facing the company.  Further research into the reasons behind the recent price surge and a comprehensive analysis of the company's future prospects are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data suggests a high level of risk associated with investing in BA.
