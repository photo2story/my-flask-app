**Analysis:**

Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial negative divergence. The negative Alpha values across most periods indicate underperformance relative to the benchmark, even when accounting for market risk (Beta).  The Beta values, while fluctuating, generally indicate a moderate correlation with the market. The CAGR and MDD highlight periods of significant losses and high volatility.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 194.52
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 194.52
    *   Previous Close: 194.58
    *   Change: -0.03
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day MA: 194.92
    *   20-day MA: 205.84
    *   60-day MA: 216.14

**Analysis:**

Boeing's recent price action shows a slight decrease, with the current price below all three moving averages. This suggests a downtrend. The price's failure to hold above the 5-day MA indicates continued short-term weakness.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 14.27 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.44 (Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (456 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.4 (Short-term Improvement)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3830.0 (Significant Underperformance)

**Analysis:**

The RSI indicates that Boeing is currently oversold, which could suggest a potential short-term bounce. However, the negative PPO indicates a bearish trend. The hybrid signal suggests a gradual investment strategy due to the high MRI and safety level.  The 'recent relative divergence change' suggests some short-term improvement, but the overwhelmingly negative "Expected Return" is very concerning, indicating a high possibility of underperforming the S&P 500 over the long term even with a gradual, regular investment approach.  The minor negative price change from the last market doesn't signal a major event on its own.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Carbon Emissions:** Boeing's carbon emissions problem being addressed by startup Charm Industrial (TechCrunch).
*   **Flydubai Order:** Boeing leading bid for a major aircraft order from Flydubai (MT Newswires).
*   **Swiss Tariffs:** US to lower tariffs on Swiss goods (Bloomberg) - potentially impacting supply chains.
*   **Bernstein Analysis:** Bernstein explains Boeing's slip since October earnings (Investing.com).
*   **FedEx MD-11 Grounding:** FedEx details contingency plans after MD-11 fleet grounding (Supply Chain Dive) - potentially impacting Boeing's parts/supply chain.
*   **Defense Workers Contract:** Boeing Defense Workers Approve New Five-Year Contract (WSJ).

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed. The potential Flydubai order is positive. However, concerns about carbon emissions and Bernstein's analysis regarding the post-earnings decline are negative.  The FedEx grounding could indirectly affect Boeing's supply chain. The new defense worker contract provides stability, which is a positive.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.52 (Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 22
*   **Target Price:**
    *   Avg: 249.32
    *   High: 285.00
    *   Low: 170.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** (No changes provided)

**Analysis:**

Despite the company's struggles, analyst consensus remains optimistic, with a "Buy" rating and a significant average target price above the current price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
| ---------- | ---- | ----------- |
| 2025-10-31 | 1.08 | 28.09 B$    |
| 2025-07-31 | 0.9  | 26.46 B$    |
| 2025-04-30 | 0.91 | 27.37 B$    |
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | 25.34 B$    |
| 2025-10-31 | 0.82 | 25.34 B$    |

**Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows improvement in both EPS and revenue compared to the previous year but an inconsistency in the last line with data duplication. While EPS has been increasing, the repeated revenue figures in the final two rows indicate a problem with the data source. This inconsistency needs clarification. The increasing EPS and Revenue are positive signals, BUT the inconsistency raises doubts about reliability.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 2025-09-30 | $23.27B | -10.21%       |
| 2025-06-30 | $22.75B | 10.70%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $19.50B | 12.40%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B | -19.66%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE       |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- |
| 2025-09-30 | $-8.25B  | 64.69%    |
| 2025-06-30 | $-3.29B  | 18.54%    |
| 2025-03-31 | $-3.33B  | 1.11%     |
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B  | 98.90%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B | 26.20%    |

**Analysis:**

The revenue and profit margin data show inconsistent performance. The negative profit margins in recent quarters are concerning. The negative equity and fluctuating ROE also raise red flags about the company's financial health.

**7. Overall Analysis and Recommendation**

Boeing presents a mixed picture. While analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy" rating and recent news includes potential positive developments (Flydubai order), the company is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, and its financial data (negative equity, fluctuating profit margins, and potentially unreliable earnings data) is concerning.

**Recommendation:**

Given the substantial underperformance, financial inconsistencies, and negative expected return, a **"Hold" or "Underweight" rating is justified for existing positions**. If considering a new investment, proceed with extreme caution. A gradual investment strategy with a very long-term outlook (2+ years) and constant monitoring might be considered, but only after thorough due diligence and validation of the financial data.
