| 2023-2025  | -9.0%   | 73.7%   | -72.0% | 0.1   | 163.8  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Shows a significant decline in compounded annual growth rate over the more recent periods.  The earlier periods (2015-2019) show strong growth, while later periods show negative growth.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Is largely negative in recent years, indicating underperformance relative to the market.
*   **Beta:**  Generally low, fluctuating close to 0, indicating that the stock price is not closely correlated with the overall market

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement:**

*   **Current Price:** 217.26
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 216.59, Previous Close: 217.26, Change: -0.31
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 214.58
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 216.03
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 223.66

**Analysis:** The stock price has slightly decreased and is trading below its 60-day moving average, but above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend but with longer-term resistance.  The recent price decrease of -0.31 is not a large enough change to indicate a significant volatility event by itself.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 52.52
*   **PPO:** 0.179
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (466 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.0 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -1762.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** While the MRI indicates a "High Investment Recommended" level, it's crucial to remember this is likely based on a specific model with its own assumptions and should be considered in conjunction with other data.
*   **RSI:**  An RSI of 52.52 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO suggests a weak upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy" signal is contradicted by the negative expected return.  The model is recommending buying based on a perceived safety level (MRI), but the expected return is extremely negative.  This highlights the importance of considering multiple indicators and potential model limitations.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change indicates short-term underperformance relative to the benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. This suggests a very pessimistic outlook for Boeing's long-term performance compared to the S&P 500.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30   | $22.75B   | 10.70%       |
| 2025-03-31   | $19.50B   | 12.40%       |

| 2024-06-30   | $16.87B   | 7.29%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE       |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 2025-06-30   | $-3.29B    | 18.54%    |
| 2025-03-31   | $-3.33B    | 1.11%     |

| 2024-09-30   | $-23.55B   | 26.20%    |
| 2024-06-30   | $-17.98B   | 8.01%     |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has increased recently, and the profit margin has turned positive in the last two quarters after two previous negative quarters. This shows some signs of financial turnaround.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** The negative equity is a significant concern. While ROE (Return on Equity) is positive, it's calculated on a negative equity base, making it difficult to interpret.

**7. 종합 Analysis (Summary):**

Boeing's stock performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500. While recent earnings and revenue data shows some improvement, negative equity and a very negative expected return are major concerns. Analyst consensus remains positive with a "Strong Buy" recommendation, but the wide range of target prices and recent news headlines highlighting potential negative earnings suggest a high degree of uncertainty. The MRI shows a high investment score but is based on a specific indicator which needs more research.
