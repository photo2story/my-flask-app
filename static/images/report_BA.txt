**1. Performance Comparison:**

Boeing Co (BA) is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide.  BA's cumulative return of -28.13% significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) which shows a 76.18% return.  The -104.3% difference highlights a substantial underperformance. The relative divergence of 10.8% confirms this significant lag relative to historical performance against the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance and high risk, reflected in the fluctuating CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), high maximum drawdown (MDD), and volatile alpha and beta values. The negative alpha values in several periods suggest underperformance relative to the market. The high beta values indicate higher volatility than the market.  Further analysis is needed to determine the drivers of this inconsistency.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 98.0% | 58.0% | 65.0% | 0.1 | 211.5 |

* **Closing Price:** $161.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $158.00
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $162.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $169.52

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential bearish trend.  The recent price increase of $3.47 (from $156.47) indicates a possible short-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 42.95 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.3565 (Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum, although relatively weak)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.4 (Indicates short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -639.6% (This extremely negative value suggests a very high risk and low expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This number needs further clarification on calculation methodology.)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue around $25 Billion but inconsistent EPS and Profit Margin.  Further investigation is required to understand the volatility in EPS. There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-10-29.

|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | $25.34 B      |

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals significant volatility in profitability and negative equity in several quarters. The highly fluctuating profit margins and negative equity raise major concerns about the financial health and stability of Boeing.  ROE also fluctuates widely, indicative of the overall volatility.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B   | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B   | -19.66%       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, exhibiting substantial volatility and negative alpha in several periods.  The company's financial health shows significant concern with negative equity and inconsistent profitability.  While short-term indicators like RSI and relative divergence suggest some potential for upside, the overall picture paints a picture of a high-risk investment with a very low expected return relative to the market, at least based on the provided data and the -639.6% expected return figure. Further detailed analysis is needed to understand the underlying causes of the poor performance and the extremely negative expected return calculation.  A thorough review of industry trends, competitive landscape and management's strategic plans are necessary before considering any investment in BA.  The extremely high negative expected return warrants serious scrutiny and independent verification.
