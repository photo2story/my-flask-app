*   **RSI:** 52.80 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.10 (Slightly Bearish)

*   **Analysis:**  The MRI suggests medium risk.  The RSI is neutral. The PPO is slightly bearish. The negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence suggests recent underperformance is worsening. The significantly negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  The hybrid signal suggests holding a high cash position and selling a small portion of holdings. The small price change from the last market close doesn't necessarily trigger any immediate concerns (no 급반등, 급하락).

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| 2025-06-30   | \$-3.29B  | 18.54%    |
| 2025-03-31   | \$-3.33B  | 1.11%     |

| 2024-06-30   | \$-17.98B | 8.01%     |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue & Profit Margin:** Revenue has been increasing in recent quarters, and profit margins have improved significantly, turning positive after negative values in 2024.
    *   **Equity & ROE:** Negative equity is a concern, but the ROE (Return on Equity) values are high, particularly in 2024-12-31. This suggests that the company is generating significant returns on its negative equity. However, negative equity is not sustainable in the long term.

**7. Overall Analysis & Summary**

Boeing (BA) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance vs. the S&P 500, negative equity, inconsistent earnings, negative expected return. High MDD. Alpha가 계속해서 마이너스 라는 것은 벤치마크 대비 꾸준히 underperform한다는 의미이다.
*   **Positives:** Recent improvement in revenue and profit margins, and recent strong EPS performance. Recent price momentum above moving averages, but more data needed to confirm a sustained trend.
*   **Overall:** While there are some positive signs of improvement in revenue and profitability, the significant underperformance relative to the market, negative equity, and negative expected return raise substantial concerns. The news snippets highlight ongoing volatility.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this data, a *cautious* approach is warranted. Further research and monitoring of company-specific developments are crucial before making any investment decisions. The Hybrid signal suggest holding a high cash position and selling a small portion of holdings. The significantly negative expected return warrants serious caution.
