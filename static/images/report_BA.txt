**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD      | Alpha     | Beta    | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|---------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | -4.0%     | 69.7%    | -60.0%    | -1.3    | 163.3  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The CAGR is highly volatile, with significant positive returns in the earlier periods (2015-2019) followed by substantial negative returns in later periods (2018-2025). The more recent periods continue to show negative or very low CAGRs, indicating poor recent performance.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values are consistently high across all periods, indicating substantial risk and volatility in Boeing's stock. This suggests significant potential losses for investors.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative in the recent periods (2018-2025), indicating that Boeing has underperformed its benchmark (presumably the S&P 500) even after adjusting for risk. The earlier periods (2015-2018) showed high positive alpha, but this trend has reversed.
*   **Beta:** The beta values are mostly negative in recent years, suggesting that Boeing's stock has moved inversely to the market. This could imply that Boeing is seen as a defensive stock, but it also reflects the company's specific challenges rather than a true defensive characteristic.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 215.94
*   **Previous Close:** 219.99
*   **Change:** -1.84
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 224.78
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 229.50
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 224.35

**Analysis:** The price has declined slightly from the previous close. The 5-day and 20-day moving averages are above the current price, indicating a short-term downward trend. The 60-day moving average, while higher than the current price, is closer, suggesting potential support. The drop from the previous close (-1.84) is indicative of the negative sentiment.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3233 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 30.11 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.83
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_59%_Sell 59.6% of holdings
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -3.6 (Negative Trend)
*   **Expected Return:** -7367.2%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests low market risk at the moment, but this should be viewed with caution given the specific issues with Boeing.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 30.11 is near the oversold threshold (30), suggesting the stock might be due for a short-term bounce.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO indicates a bearish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  A "Sell" signal with a high cash recommendation (59%) suggests significant caution is warranted.
*   **Relative Divergence:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent underperformance relative to the benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return suggests very pessimistic long-term expectations, assuming current trends continue.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **FAA Fines:** FAA seeks $3.1 million in fines from Boeing over safety violations.
*   **Valuation Concerns:** Articles discuss evaluating Boeing's current valuation amid share price swings.
*   **Union Rejection:** Boeing Defense Union rejects latest contract offer.
*   **777X Delays:** Delays in the 777X program are causing concern.

**Analysis:** The news flow is predominantly negative. Safety concerns, union issues, and delays are all weighing on the stock. These factors likely contribute to the negative sentiment reflected in the stock's price action.

### 4-2) Analyst Opinions

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.58)
*   **Target Price:** 252.39 (Average) / 287.00 (High) / 150.00 (Low)

**Analysis:** Despite the negative news and performance, the analyst consensus is still leaning towards "Buy" with an average target price significantly above the current price. This might reflect an expectation of a turnaround or potential long-term value. The wide range of target prices (150 to 287) suggests uncertainty among analysts.

### 5. Recent Earnings Analysis

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |

### 7. Comprehensive Analysis

Boeing's stock is currently facing significant headwinds. It has substantially underperformed the S&P 500, with a very low relative divergence, placing it near the bottom of its historical relative performance. Technical indicators such as RSI and PPO suggest a bearish trend. Recent news is predominantly negative, highlighting safety concerns, union issues, and program delays. The company has negative equity, adding to the concern. Despite these issues, analysts maintain a "Buy" consensus, possibly anticipating a turnaround. However, the "Sell" hybrid signal and the extremely negative expected return suggest substantial caution. This stock is very high-risk.
