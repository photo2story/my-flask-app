2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a report analyzing Boeing (BA) based on the information provided:

**1. Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Boeing Co is a leading global aerospace company, primarily focused on commercial airplanes, defense, space, and security systems.

*   **Return Rate:**
    *   BA Cumulative Return: 0.09086 (9.09%)
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 91.3981 (9139.81%)
    *   Divergence: -105.0 (Relative Divergence: 6.8)

*   **Analysis of Return Rate:** Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. The negative divergence of -105.0 highlights this substantial difference in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 6.8 indicates that this underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2016-2018  | 57.0% | 95.5% | 53.0% | 1.2 | 252.5 |
| 2017-2019  | 20.0% | 65.8% | 3.0% | 1.2 | 255.1 |
| 2018-2020  | -75.0% | 99.9% | -96.0% | 1.6 | 167.6 |
| 2019-2021  | -57.0% | 99.9% | -101.0% | 1.6 | 157.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -35.0% | 99.9% | -33.0% | 1.6 | 149.2 |
| 2021-2023  | 1.0% | 99.9% | 1.0% | 1.2 | 204.1 |
| 2022-2024  | -33.0% | 100.0% | -52.0% | 1.1 | 138.6 |
| 2023-2025  | -8.0% | 100.0% | -70.0% | 1.1 | 170.0 |

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis Explanation:**

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows the average annual growth rate of the investment over the period.  Note the negative CAGRs in recent periods.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. Boeing has consistently experienced very high MDDs, indicating significant volatility and risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Measures the investment's performance relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500).  The consistently negative Alpha values (especially in recent years) confirm the significant underperformance compared to the market.
    *   **Beta:** Measures the investment's volatility relative to the market. A Beta around 1.1-1.6 suggests that Boeing's stock is generally more volatile than the overall market.
    *   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization in Billions.
    *   **Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta analysis underscores Boeing's struggles. The negative Alphas highlight its underperformance, while the high Betas suggest increased volatility. The high MDDs further demonstrate the risk associated with this investment.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Current Price: 217.12
*   Previous Close: 218.5
*   Change: -0.63
*   5-day SMA: 217.494
*   20-day SMA: 208.94
*   60-day SMA: 204.8942

*   **Analysis:** The stock price has decreased slightly from the previous close. The 5-day SMA is currently above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a recent short-term upward trend. However, the price is just above the 5-day SMA, so this trend might be losing strength.

**3. RSI, PPO Index Indicators and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence, Expected_Return**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 86.277 (Overbought)
*   PPO: 0.5163
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: 0.9 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   Expected Return (%): 0.0 (Long-term)

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI:**  Despite the other warning signs, the MRI surprisingly suggests a high investment recommendation. This should be viewed with caution, considering the other indicators.
    *   **RSI:**  The RSI is significantly above 70, indicating that Boeing is currently overbought and could be due for a correction.
    *   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being positive suggests the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, confirming the recent upward trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** Suggests a full investment of available cash, while rating this as "Very Safe."
    *   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence indicates that Boeing has slightly outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 20 days, but this is a very short-term trend.
    *   **Expected Return:** The expected long-term return being 0% is a very negative signal, suggesting that analysts do not anticipate Boeing outperforming the market.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Headlines:**
    *   Boeing Lands $8.6 Billion F-15 Contract For Israel
    *   Boeing awarded $2.73B Army contract
    *   Ascent Group LLC Buys 8,075 Shares of The Boeing Company $BA
*   **Mixed/Neutral Headlines:**
    *   Dan Niles Loves Boeing Stock (NYSE:BA) in 2026; Current Investors Less Certain
    *   The Boeing Company (BA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It
    *   Boeing Stock (NYSE:BA) Notches Up Despite China Sanctions

*   **Analysis:** The recent news is a mixed bag. The new contracts are positive developments and could provide a short-term boost to the stock. However, the analyst opinions are less decisive, and the China sanctions are a potential headwind.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   Consensus: Buy
*   Mean Rating: 1.61 (~Buy)
*   Opinions: 25
*   Target Price (avg/high/low): 245.76 / 285.00 / 150.00
*   Recent Rating Changes: Not Provided

*   **Analysis:**  Despite the company's struggles, the analyst consensus is still a "Buy" with an average target price significantly above the current price. However, the wide range of target prices (150.00 to 285.00) suggests considerable uncertainty about the stock's future performance. The lack of recent rating changes is neutral, which is strange considering the stock fluctuation.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜         | EPS  | 매출      |
|--------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-10-31   | 1.08 | 28.09 B$  |

| 2025-04-30   | 0.91 | 27.37 B$  |
| 2024-10-29   | 0.82 | 25.34 B$  |
| 2025-10-31   | 0.82 | 25.34 B$  |

*   **Analysis:** Both EPS and Revenue have shown an upward trend in the recent quarters. The most recent EPS of 1.08 is the highest in the table, and revenue has consistently been above $25 billion. This suggests improved profitability.

| 2025-09-30   | $-8.25B   | 64.69%   |
| 2025-06-30   | $-3.29B   | 18.54%   |
| 2025-03-31   | $-3.33B   | 1.11%    |

| 2024-09-30   | $-23.55B  | 26.20%   |

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue has been increasing, but Profit Margin shows fluctuation, with two negative quarters indicating losses.
    *   **Capital & Profitability:** The Equity remains negative, indicating that the company's liabilities exceed its assets. However, the ROE (Return on Equity) shows high values, but that should be interpreted with caution due to the negative equity.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Boeing is a complex investment case.

*   **Negatives:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (negative divergence and Alpha).
    *   High volatility (high Beta and MDD).
    *   Overbought RSI, suggesting a potential correction.
    *   Negative Equity with high ROE suggesting caution.
    *   0% Expected Return.

*   **Positives:**
    *   Recent positive earnings and revenue trends.
    *   Recent contract wins.
    *   Analyst consensus rating of "Buy" (although with significant target price uncertainty).
    *   Increasing Revenue.

*   **Overall Conclusion:**

    While there are some positive signs, the numerous risks and negative indicators suggest caution. The analyst "Buy" rating should be viewed skeptically given the significant divergence from the S&P 500 and the high level of volatility. Investors should carefully weigh the potential rewards against the substantial risks before investing in Boeing. The current MRI is misleading and should be disregarded. This investment is speculative and high risk.
