    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values indicate significant potential losses from peak to trough during these periods, highlighting volatility.

    *   **Beta:** Beta values generally below 1 suggest that Boeing's price is theoretically less volatile than the market. However, the negative returns and high MDD suggest Boeing's specific issues are driving performance more than market volatility.
    *   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** The market capitalization has fluctuated, with significant drops during periods of negative performance.
