**1) Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Boeing's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **BA Cumulative Return:** -27.91%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 76.31%
* **Divergence:** -104.2% (This means BA underperformed VOO by 104.2 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -10.8% indicates that BA's performance is in the lower 10.8th percentile compared to its historical performance relative to the VOO.)

The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta data show significant volatility in performance over time.  High CAGRs are counterbalanced by substantial maximum drawdowns (MDDs) and negative Alphas in several periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market (as measured by the Beta).  The negative Alphas suggest consistent underperformance against the benchmark, further underscored by the large negative cumulative return compared to the VOO.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $162.52
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $159.15
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $160.74
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $168.97

The price is slightly above its 5 and 20-day moving averages but significantly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent price increase but still within a bearish trend over a longer timeframe.  The recent price change of $2.0 from the previous close indicates a modest daily upward movement.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.54 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** 0.67 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -640.0% (This extremely negative expected return requires further clarification.  It is likely an error or needs context about the calculation method and timeframe.)  The extremely negative expected return of -640% is highly improbable and warrants further investigation into its calculation and underlying assumptions.

The high ROE figures in some quarters, despite negative equity, warrant further investigation and may reflect accounting peculiarities.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B   | -10.43%       |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's stock performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility and periods of substantial underperformance.  Negative Alphas consistently point to underperformance relative to the market.  Financial statements reveal troubling issues with profitability and negative equity, raising serious concerns about the company's financial health.  While some short-term technical indicators suggest potential upward movement, the long-term outlook is clouded by persistent operational and financial challenges.  The extremely negative long-term expected return (-640%) is highly unusual and requires further explanation and validation before being considered reliable.  Before any investment decision, a thorough review of Boeing's financial health and future prospects is crucial.  The data provided suggests a high-risk investment.
