## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Boeing's cumulative return is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500.  As of the last data point, BA's cumulative return is -6.5%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) boasts a 120.8% return. This results in a substantial divergence of -127.3 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 6.0 indicates that BA's performance relative to the S&P 500 is near the lower bound of its historical range.

* **Company Overview:** Boeing Co is an aerospace company that designs, manufactures, and sells commercial airplanes, defense products, and space systems worldwide.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided alpha and beta data suggest that historically, BA has demonstrated low beta (0.2), indicating lower volatility compared to the market.  However, its alpha has been highly variable, ranging from significantly positive to deeply negative in recent years, reflecting the company's challenges. Notably, the periods from 2018-2022 show substantial negative alphas and large MDDs, coincident with the 737 MAX crisis and the pandemic.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

BA's recent price action suggests a potential upward trend. The current price ($173.03) is below the last market close ($176.22) but above the 5-day ($169.91), 20-day ($157.36), and 60-day ($153.599) moving averages. This indicates short-to-medium-term positive momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (82.44):**  The high RSI suggests the stock is currently overbought, increasing the risk of a potential pullback.
* **PPO (1.3142):** The positive PPO indicates bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (+1.6):** The positive change in relative divergence over the last 20 days further reinforces the short-term upward momentum.  While the last market close ($176.22) isn't exceptionally high in the context of the provided data, it does contribute to the positive momentum picture.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The neutral long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests no significant outperformance is anticipated over the next two years or more.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* **Latest Quarterly Results Comparison:**  Comparing the reported earnings per share (EPS) and revenue, we observe fluctuations in recent quarters.  EPS has varied between $0.77 and $0.91, while revenue has ranged from $25.17B to $25.82B.  The most recent quarter (2024-10-29) shows an EPS of $0.82 and revenue of $25.34B, slightly down from the previous quarter.  Two identical entries for 2024-10-29 and 2023-10-31 are likely an error in the data.

* **Revenue Growth Trends:** Revenue has remained relatively flat over the past few quarters, with only minor fluctuations.

* **EPS Trends:** EPS has shown some volatility, with no clear upward or downward trend discernible from the limited data.

* **Beats/Misses:** Without analyst consensus estimates, we cannot determine if these results represent beats or misses.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has fluctuated, notably declining in the most recent quarter (2024-09-30). Profit margin is also volatile, swinging from positive to significantly negative (-19.66%) in the last quarter.

* **Capital and Profitability:**  Boeing has negative equity throughout the reported period. While ROE has been positive in recent quarters, the context of negative equity makes interpretation complex.  A negative equity position typically indicates accumulated losses exceeding retained earnings and contributed capital.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires access to real-time news and analyst reports, which are not provided within the scope of this prompt.  Key areas to investigate include the latest earnings announcements' impact, recent market outlook for the aerospace industry, and any analyst upgrades/downgrades or price target adjustments for BA.

**7. Summary and Overall Analysis:**

Boeing shows some positive short-term momentum based on price action and technical indicators. However, the stock remains significantly below the S&P 500 performance.  The company faces challenges with fluctuating revenue, profitability, and a negative equity position.  The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought in the short term.  A thorough evaluation of recent news, analyst opinions, and a deeper dive into the financials are crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.  The neutral long-term expected return warrants caution.  Further research is recommended to understand the underlying drivers of the company's performance and the potential impact of ongoing industry trends.
