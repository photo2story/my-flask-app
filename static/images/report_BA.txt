2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Boeing (BA) based on the data provided:

**0) Simple Numbers First, Then Analysis**

Okay, let's break down the data, starting with the raw numbers and then moving to analysis.

**1) Return Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **BA Overview:** Boeing Co. is a leading global aerospace company that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide.
*   **BA Cumulative Return:** 0.0908646540367597 (9.09%)
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 105.07464501011228 (105.07%)
*   **Divergence:** -105.0 (Relative Divergence: 6.8)

**Analysis of Return and Alpha/Beta:**

*   Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The cumulative return is vastly lower, and the divergence is substantial. This means that an investment in Boeing over the same period would have yielded far less than a general investment in the overall market.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   **Early Performance (2016-2019):**  Boeing exhibited strong CAGR and alpha, suggesting significant outperformance relative to the market. The beta of 1.2 indicates it was more volatile than the market.
    *   **Subsequent Decline (2018-2024):**  CAGR turned negative, MDD remained high, and alpha became significantly negative. This indicates substantial underperformance and high risk.  The Beta remained high, further confirming the volatility.
    *   **Recent Performance (2023-2025):** Modest return, but still negative alpha, indicating that even with some recovery, it underperforms relative to the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 217.1199951171875
*   **Last Market Change:** Price: 217.12, Previous Close: 218.5, Change: -0.63
*   **5-day SMA:** 217.494
*   **20-day SMA:** 208.94
*   **60-day SMA:** 204.8942

**Analysis of Stock Price:**

*   The stock price is currently around $217.12, which is very close to its 5-day SMA (217.494).
*   The 20-day SMA (208.94) and 60-day SMA (204.8942) are significantly lower, suggesting an upward trend over the past few weeks. The stock price is trading *above* both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which is generally considered a bullish signal.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 86.27756778905339
*   **PPO:** 0.5163
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 0.9 (+): Short-term increase
*   **Price Change:** {'price': 217.12, 'previousClose': 218.5, 'change': -0.63}
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0%

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI suggests the model considers Boeing to be a relatively safe investment at this time, despite other negative indicators.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 86.28 is *very* overbought. This indicates the stock may be due for a pullback or correction.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) measures the momentum of a stock. A positive PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating an uptrend, albeit a mild one.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Indicates short-term upward momentum, which aligns with the stock price trading above its SMAs.
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0% is concerning. It suggests that, based on the model, there's no expected excess return over the S&P 500 by investing in Boeing long-term *from this point*. This contradicts the high MRI.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive News:**
    *   Dan Niles Likes Boeing Stock (NYSE:BA) in 2026.
    *   Boeing Awarded $2.73B Army Contract.
    *   Boeing Lands $8.6 Billion F-15 Contract for Israel.
    *   Ascent Group LLC Buys 8,075 Shares of The Boeing Company.

    *   The Boeing Company (BA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It. (Implies high investor attention, but not necessarily positive.)

**Analysis of News:**

*   The recent news is a mix of positive and neutral. The contract awards are good news, demonstrating Boeing's ability to secure large government contracts. Analyst optimism is also positive. However, the "trending stock" headline is more neutral, and the China sanctions resilience implies an existing headwind.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.61)
*   **Target Price:** Average: $245.76, High: $285.00, Low: $150.00

**Analysis of Analyst Opinions:**

*   The analyst consensus is "Buy," and the average target price ($245.76) is above the current price ($217.12). This suggests analysts, on average, expect the stock to appreciate.  However, the wide range of target prices ($150 to $285) indicates considerable uncertainty among analysts.

**Analysis of Earnings:**

*   Earnings per share (EPS) and revenue have shown an upward trend in recent quarters, though inconsistent. This suggests improving financial performance. The duplication of the last row makes it hard to read all the data. 

**6) Financial Information**

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------- |
| 2025-09-30   | $23.27B  | -10.21%         |
| 2025-06-30   | $22.75B  | 10.70%          |

| 2024-09-30   | $17.84B  | -19.66%         |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE     |
| ------------ | --------- | ------- |
| 2025-09-30   | $-8.25B  | 64.69%  |
| 2025-06-30   | $-3.29B  | 18.54%  |
| 2025-03-31   | $-3.33B  | 1.11%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $-3.91B  | 98.90%  |
| 2024-09-30   | $-23.55B | 26.20%  |

**Analysis of Financial Information:**

*   **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue has generally been increasing but profit margins have fluctuated between negative and positive. The trend toward positive profit margins is a good sign.
*   **Capital & Profitability:**  Boeing has negative equity. While ROE (Return on Equity) figures may appear high, they can be misleading when equity is negative. A negative book value, therefore high ROI is good at a high level, but concerning since it points to high potential financial risk.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term.
*   **Mixed Signals:**
    *   Technicals: Recent price action and SMA relationships suggest a potential upward trend, but the RSI indicates the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction.
    *   Financials: Revenue growth is positive, but negative equity and fluctuating profit margins are concerning.
    *   Sentiment: Analyst consensus is "Buy," but with a wide range of target prices, showing uncertainty. Recent news is a mix of positive contracts and neutral/mixed articles.
*   **Contradictory Indicators:**  The high MRI (0.9, suggesting "safe" investment) contradicts the 0.0% expected return, the history of underperformance, and the negative equity. This inconsistency makes it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion based on the provided data alone.
*   **Key Risks and Opportunities:**
    *   **Risks:** Debt, production issues, ongoing supply chain constraints, potential impact of China sanctions, and overbought conditions.
    *   **Opportunities:** Strong government contracts, potential for increased air travel demand, and analyst optimism.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on this data, a cautious approach is warranted. While there are positive signs, the long-term underperformance, overbought conditions, and concerning financial data points raise red flags. The conflicting signals from the MRI and the Expected Return further muddy the waters.

A potential investor should conduct further, independent research, paying particular attention to Boeing's debt levels, its ability to improve profit margins consistently, and its strategy for addressing its negative equity.  They should also monitor news related to production issues, delivery timelines, and any further impact from geopolitical events. Given the high RSI, waiting for a potential pullback might be prudent.
