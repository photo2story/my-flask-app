## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Boeing Co (BA) based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Boeing Co is a major American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, and missiles worldwide.

The cumulative return for BA is -18.03%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 125.6%.  This represents a significant underperformance of BA compared to the market benchmark. The provided data shows a large divergence, with a current relative divergence of -143.63, indicating BA is substantially below the S&P 500's performance over the observed period. The historical range of the relative divergence (max: 146.62, min: -149.43) suggests this underperformance is not entirely unprecedented, but nonetheless extreme.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures fluctuate significantly across the years, highlighting BA's volatile performance.  While high CAGRs were observed in some periods (exceeding 140%), these were followed by periods of substantial negative returns and high MDDs. The beta consistently remains above 1, indicating higher volatility than the overall market. This volatility is further confirmed by the fluctuating alpha which sometimes is negative as well.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $145.6
* **5-day Moving Average:** $141.55
* **20-day Moving Average:** $149.35
* **60-day Moving Average:** $154.72

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 40.16 – This indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible.  However, it's not a strong buy signal on its own.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.42 – A negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.3 – This confirms the short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – The provided data suggests no expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment.  This needs further investigation and context.  The fact that the value is 0.0 doesn't automatically imply the stock will match the S&P 500's growth.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows slight fluctuations in EPS and revenue over the past few quarters. There's no clear upward or downward trend apparent in the provided limited data, and comparison to analyst estimates is needed for a thorough evaluation.  The October 29th, 2024 data appears to be duplicated.  The provided data is too limited to accurately assess the current financial health of Boeing.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Significant fluctuations in profitability are observed, with some quarters showing substantial losses (-$3.51B in Q3 2024). This highlights the inherent risk in Boeing's business model, vulnerable to economic downturns and unforeseen events.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Negative equity figures across multiple quarters raise concerns about the company's financial stability and liquidity. ROE (Return on Equity) shows significant variability, indicative of volatile profitability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 recently. While some technical indicators suggest potential short-term rebounds, the company's financial health shows substantial volatility and concerning aspects like negative equity.  The lack of sustained profitability and the significant negative divergence from the market benchmark raise serious questions about long-term investment prospects. Further investigation is needed to evaluate current news, analyst predictions and provide a complete picture.  The data suggests caution is warranted.  A thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial to assess the current sentiment and outlook for BA stock.
