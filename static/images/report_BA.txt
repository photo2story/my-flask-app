**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $174.63
* **Last Market Price:** $173.51 (a decrease of -$0.64)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $175.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $180.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $173.94

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-to-medium-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 38.81 (below 40, indicating oversold conditions, but this alone isn't a buy signal)
* **PPO:** -0.83 (negative value, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.3 (slightly positive, suggesting a short-term upward trend, though weak)
* **Expected Return:** -740.2% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further clarification and context.  It likely reflects the significant underperformance observed).  The stated extremely negative expected return needs serious scrutiny and likely results from a flawed calculation methodology.  This is very unrealistic and should be re-examined.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-29 | $0.82 | $25.34 B      |
| 2024-07-30 | $0.83 | $25.38 B      |

| 2024-10-29 | $0.91 | $25.17 B      | *(Duplicate entry, potential error in data)*

Revenue has remained relatively consistent, but EPS shows some fluctuation, with a slight downward trend recently.  The duplicate entry for October 29th, 2024 needs to be resolved to ensure data accuracy.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B    | -10.43%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B    | -19.66%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B    | 7.29%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B    | 11.32%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B    | 12.25%       |

Profit margins are highly volatile and show a recent significant decline into negative territory.  This is a major concern.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE          |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B    | 98.90%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B   | 26.20%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B   | 8.01%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B   | 2.02%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B   | 0.13%        |

Negative equity is a significant red flag.  ROE is also highly volatile, suggesting substantial risk and uncertainty.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance is significantly lagging the market, showing substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Financial statements reveal concerning volatility in profitability and negative equity, raising serious concerns about the company's financial health. While revenue remains relatively stable, the substantial losses and negative profit margins are alarming.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, and the extremely negative projected long-term return (which needs serious re-evaluation) points to significant risk.  Further investigation into the causes of the significant underperformance and negative equity is crucial before any investment decisions are made. The provided -740.2% expected return is highly improbable and should be independently verified.
