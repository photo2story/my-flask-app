## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Boeing Co (BA), a major aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling aircraft, spacecraft, and missiles, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The cumulative return for BA is -5.08%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 120.36%. This represents a substantial divergence of -125.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -6.7% indicates BA's performance is considerably below the historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows periods of strong performance followed by significant declines, highlighting the volatility inherent in BA's stock.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures further emphasize this risk. The consistently low alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market, while the beta of around 0.2 indicates lower volatility than the overall market, although this may be skewed due to the different time periods shown.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last data point, BA's closing price was $175.56.  The recent price movement indicates a somewhat bullish trend but still below significant moving averages:

* **5-day moving average:** $169.76
* **20-day moving average:** $173.71
* **60-day moving average:** $160.59

The price is above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential short-term upward momentum, but still below the 20-day average, indicating some hesitancy in the trend.  The recent price change of $2.61 (a approximately 1.5% increase) suggests a potential short-term positive shift, but further observation is needed.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 41.54 suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.52 indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.9 indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** -886.9% This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term highlights the considerable risk.  This negative expected return is highly unusual, and careful review of the calculation methodology is advised.  It likely reflects the historical underperformance against the S&P 500 and should be taken with extreme caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While revenue generally remained relatively stable in the high $25B range, EPS fluctuated somewhat. The slight decline in revenue in the last quarter may warrant further investigation.  The data point duplication for October 29th, 2024 needs clarification to ensure accuracy.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data reveals significant volatility and concerns:

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Large swings in profit margins indicate inconsistent profitability. The negative profit margin in Q3 2024 is particularly concerning.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Negative equity throughout the period suggests a potentially precarious financial position.  The fluctuating ROE further supports the observation of significant volatility and financial inconsistency.


**7.  Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance is currently lagging significantly behind the S&P 500. While some recent price increases suggest potential short-term upward momentum, the company faces considerable challenges.  Negative expected returns, volatile earnings, inconsistent profitability, and a negative equity position paint a concerning picture.  Technical indicators suggest a potential bottom, but further improvement is needed for a positive outlook.  The high historical MDD figures demonstrate considerable risk.   Investors should proceed with extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering any investment in BA.  The exceptionally negative long-term expected return demands particularly careful scrutiny of its calculation.
