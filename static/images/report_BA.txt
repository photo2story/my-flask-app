**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** Boeing Co is a leading global aerospace company, primarily manufacturing commercial jetliners, defense, space and security systems, and service offerings.
*   **Performance:** Boeing (BA) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). The cumulative return of BA is -1.30% compared to VOO's 100.58%, representing a substantial divergence of -109.80%. The relative divergence of 0.3 suggests that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   The table shows a stark contrast in Boeing's performance over different periods.
    *   **2015-2019:** The company experienced strong growth (high CAGR) but also faced significant drawdowns (MDD). Alpha was positive, but Beta was low, indicating lower market sensitivity.
    *   **2018-2025:** The recent periods show negative returns (negative CAGR), high maximum drawdowns (MDD), negative Alpha, and higher Beta values, reflecting the stock's increased volatility and underperformance relative to the market.
    *   **Trends:** Alpha has consistently deteriorated over the years. Beta has increased, suggesting higher sensitivity to market movements (Boeing now moves more in line with market direction, amplifying losses when the market declines). Cap(B) decreased significantly, indicating a large decline in the size of the company.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 202.54
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 201.89, Previous Close: 201.87, Change: 0.01. This shows minimal recent change.
*   **Moving Averages:** The 5-day SMA (197.41) is below the 20-day SMA (191.91), and both are below the 60-day SMA (208.04). This *could* signal a potential downtrend in the short to medium term, as shorter-term averages falling below longer-term averages is often interpreted as bearish.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8. This indicates a "Medium Investment" recommendation based on the MRI.
*   **RSI:** 57.81. This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. It's in a neutral range.
*   **PPO:** 1.45. A positive PPO suggests a short-term bullish trend, as the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)". This signal suggests allocating all available cash to purchase a small number of shares, indicating a cautious but optimistic approach, given the MRI is still considered "Very Safe".
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.3 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline).  This confirms the recent underperformance compared to the benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** -4059%. This is an extremely negative figure, indicating a very pessimistic outlook for Boeing compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.

    *   **Positive Notes:** Mentions of "Easy Ghost Bat Deployment" (suggesting advancements in defense technology) and Bernstein's positive outlook ("Don't Count It Out").
    *   **Negative Notes:** Articles questioning what BA stock has done for investors, indicating potential underperformance and discussions about whether it's "Time to Sell." Why Boeing Company Stock Is Falling Today?.
    *   **Overall Impression:** The news sentiment appears slightly negative, with concerns about current performance outweighing positive developments.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) and analyst ratings present a mixed picture. The RSI indicates a neutral position, and the PPO suggests a short-term bullish trend, while analysts generally recommend buying.

*   **Caution Advised:** Despite analyst buy recommendations, the extremely negative expected return and negative equity suggest caution. The company faces significant challenges and risks.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the comprehensive analysis, a **neutral to slightly bearish** stance on Boeing (BA) is recommended. While analysts are generally optimistic, the negative financial indicators (negative equity, negative expected return) and underperformance compared to the market warrant caution. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and consider a small, strategic allocation to the stock if they believe in the company's long-term turnaround potential. Keep a close eye on financial performance and news developments.
