Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Boeing (BA) based on the data provided, structured as requested.

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Boeing Co is a leading global aerospace company that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide.

*   **Return Rate Performance:**
    *   Boeing (BA) Cumulative Return: 4.32%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 100.88%

    *   Relative Divergence: 6.3

*   **Analysis:** Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The -96.6 divergence highlights this substantial gap in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 6.3 suggests that the current divergence is near its minimum within the historical range considered.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 97.0%   | 67.9% | 68.0%   | 0.0   | 235.3  |

| 2017-2019  | 38.0%   | 74.7% | 16.0%   | 0.2   | 259.9  |
| 2018-2020  | -74.0%  | 82.3% | -98.0%  | 0.4   | 170.8  |
| 2019-2021  | -63.0%  | 82.3% | -110.0% | 1.1   | 160.7  |
| 2020-2022  | -42.0%  | 82.3% | -41.0%  | 1.0   | 152.0  |
| 2021-2023  | -2.0%   | 74.5% | -4.0%   | 0.3   | 208.0  |
| 2022-2024  | -39.0%  | 74.5% | -60.0%  | 0.4   | 141.2  |
| 2023-2025  | -14.0%  | 73.7% | -79.0%  | 0.3   | 170.8  |

*   **CAGR Analysis:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows a drastic decline in recent years. While there were periods of substantial growth (2015-2017, 2016-2018), more recent periods exhibit significant negative growth.
*   **MDD Analysis:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant risk, consistently above 70%. This points to substantial volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha Analysis:**  Alpha, which measures performance relative to a benchmark, is overwhelmingly negative in recent years.  This means Boeing has significantly underperformed compared to what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta Analysis:** The Beta value, measuring systematic risk, is relatively low. A beta near or below 1 indicates that the stock is less volatile than the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close Price: 214.08
*   Last Market Data: Price=218.16, Previous Close=216.85, Change=0.6
*   5-day SMA: 208.178
*   20-day SMA: 199.1971
*   60-day SMA: 204.95

*   **Analysis:** The current price of $218.16 is above all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which *could* indicate a short-term upward trend. However, the 5-day SMA being above the 20-day SMA, which is also above the 60-day SMA, may suggest the rally is losing steam and is not yet a strong long-term trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   MRI: 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 64.88 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   PPO: 0.9163 (Indicates positive momentum)
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = 2.0 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   {'price': 218.16, 'previousClose': 216.85, 'change': 0.6}: The price is up slightly, a sharp price increase will be a positive reflection in this issue.
*   Expected Return (%): -610.4% (Negative, indicates significant expected underperformance compared to S&P 500 over a long-term investment from this point).

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, but should be evaluated under the poor Expected Return of the stock
    *   The RSI near 65 suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but is nearing the overbought threshold (typically 70).
    *   The PPO indicates positive momentum in the short term.
    *   The negative Expected Return is a significant red flag, suggesting that the model predicts substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if an investor were to buy at the current price.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive News:**
    *   Analyst Upgrade:  Boeing received a "Buy" rating from Citi and analyst upgrades from other firms.
    *   Defense Contract:  Boeing secured a $2 billion defense contract.
    *   Firefighting Strength: Indicates Boeing's products are seeing increased demand in specific sectors.
    *   Spirit AeroSystems Acquisition Completion
*   **Negative News:**
    *   NASA Safety Concerns: A safety panel took NASA to task regarding Boeing's safety protocols.

*   **Analysis:** Recent news is mixed. Analyst upgrades and contract wins are positive. However, safety concerns raised by NASA are a serious concern and could negatively impact investor sentiment.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   Consensus: Buy (Mean: 1.59)
*   Target Price: $244.54 (Avg), $285 (High), $150 (Low)

*   **Analysis:** Despite some of the negative data, the analyst consensus remains a "Buy" with a target price significantly above the current price.  This suggests that analysts believe the company will overcome its current challenges. However, the wide range in target prices ($150 - $285) reflects uncertainty in the stock's future performance.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜        | EPS  | 매출      |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-10-31 | 1.08 | 28.09 B$ |
| 2025-07-31 | 0.9  | 26.46 B$ |

| 2025-10-31 | 0.82 | 25.34 B$ |

*   **Analysis:**  Earnings per share (EPS) and revenue have shown improvement in recent quarters. The EPS shows a volatile history with a gradual increase in revenue, suggesting a positive trend in the company's performance.

**6) Financial Information**

| 2025-06-30  | $22.75B   | 10.70%        |
| 2025-03-31  | $19.50B   | 12.40%        |
| 2024-12-31  | $15.24B   | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30  | $17.84B   | -19.66%       |

|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30  | $-8.25B   | 64.69%   |
| 2025-06-30  | $-3.29B   | 18.54%   |

| 2024-09-30  | $-23.55B   | 26.20%   |

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has generally increased in recent quarters. However, profit margins remain volatile, with both positive and negative quarters. The negative profit margin in the most recent quarter (2025-09-30) is a cause for concern.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Boeing has negative equity, which is a significant red flag.  While Return on Equity (ROE) figures appear high, they are skewed due to the negative equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Boeing presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (negative divergence, negative alpha).
    *   High volatility (high MDD).
    *   Negative Expected Return, suggesting a poor long-term investment outlook.
    *   Negative equity and volatile profit margins.
    *   NASA safety concerns.

*   **Positives:**
    *   Recent improvements in EPS and revenue.
    *   Analyst consensus remains a "Buy" with a potentially high target price.
    *   Recent contract wins and analyst upgrades.
    *   Positive PPO and recent short-term price movement.
    *   MRI recommends Medium Investment

**Conclusion:**

Based on this data, investing in Boeing is risky. While there are positive signs, the company faces significant challenges, particularly regarding profitability, safety concerns, and long-term return potential.
The analyst consensus suggests potential upside, but the significant challenges and negative long-term outlook should give a cautious and careful consideration before investing in Boeing.
