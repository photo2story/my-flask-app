**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $184.80
* **Last Market Price:** $182.60 (Down $2.20 from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $179.05
* **20-day Moving Average:** $174.69
* **60-day Moving Average:** $165.55

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the recent daily price drop indicates some near-term downward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 70.02 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.283 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 1.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term, vs. VOO):** -694.2% (This extremely negative value suggests significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term based on the provided data.  This requires further investigation and contextualization to understand the underlying reasons.)

The recent price drop of $2.20 may be interpreted as a minor correction within a broader upward trend based on the moving averages. The high RSI suggests caution and potential for near-term correction. The negative expected return requires careful consideration and additional analysis.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | 25.34 B$ |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.83 | 25.38 B$ |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.77 | 25.82 B$ |
| 2023-10-31 | 0.91 | 25.17 B$ |
| 2024-10-29 | 0.91 | 25.17 B$ |

There's a discrepancy in the data – two entries for 2024-10-29.  Assuming the second entry is a correction, EPS and revenue show slight variations across the quarters, with no clear upward or downward trend readily apparent from this limited data.  Further analysis with a longer historical perspective is recommended.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B | -10.43% |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B | -19.66% |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B | 7.29% |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B | 11.32% |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B | 12.25% |

Revenue fluctuates, and profit margins show significant volatility, including negative margins in two recent quarters. This highlights potential concerns regarding the company's profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B | 98.90% |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B | 26.20% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B | 8.01% |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B | 2.02% |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B | 0.13% |

Negative equity across all reported quarters is a serious concern. ROE is also highly volatile, possibly due to the negative equity affecting the calculation. This data indicates significant financial challenges for Boeing.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has been significantly underwhelming compared to the S&P 500.  While recent price action shows some signs of upward momentum, the high RSI warns of potential overbought conditions.  Financial statements reveal significant concerns, including negative equity and highly volatile profit margins and ROE.  The extremely negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 underscores the substantial risk associated with this investment.  Before making any investment decision, thorough due diligence, including a deeper dive into the company's operational challenges and future outlook, is crucial.  The provided data alone does not provide sufficient information to confidently recommend or advise against investing in BA.
