**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B   | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B   | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B   | 7.29%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B   | 11.32%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B   | 12.25%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE           |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B   | 98.90%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B  | 26.20%        |

Profitability is highly volatile, swinging between significant losses and modest profits.  Negative equity is a major concern, indicating a potentially weak financial position.  The high ROE figures in some quarters need careful scrutiny in light of the negative equity; they might be misleading.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's stock performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting substantial volatility and negative alpha. While recent revenue is relatively stable, profitability and equity are major concerns.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend, although some signals hint at potential short-term upward movement.  The extremely negative expected return figure requires further investigation.  Given the current financial situation and consistent underperformance, a long-term investment in BA requires careful consideration and a thorough understanding of the underlying risks associated with the company's operational and financial challenges.  The negative equity is a particularly worrying sign and needs to be addressed by management.  Before making any investment decisions, it is crucial to conduct further due diligence and consider consulting with a financial advisor.
