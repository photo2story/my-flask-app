**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR & MDD:** Early periods (2015-2019) show high growth (CAGR) but also significant potential drawdowns (MDD). Later periods (2018 onwards) show significant losses and high MDD. This reflects the challenges Boeing has faced, especially related to the 737 MAX.
*   **Alpha:** The consistently negative or low Alpha indicates that Boeing has underperformed its expected return based on its risk (Beta).
*   **Beta:** Beta has fluctuated, indicating the volatility of the stock relative to the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Boeing's market capitalization has varied considerably across the periods, reflecting changes in investor confidence and company performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $218.5
*   **Last Market Change:** +$0.58
*   **5-day SMA:** $217.44
*   **20-day SMA:** $208.30
*   **60-day SMA:** $205.03

**Analysis:** The stock is trading above its 5, 20, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a short-term uptrend. The recent price increase of $0.58 is a positive sign. The moving averages also support this observation, as the faster moving average is above the slower moving averages.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - This suggests the system believes the current market conditions are favorable for investment, despite the risks associated with Boeing itself.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 85.37 - This indicates that Boeing is currently overbought, suggesting a potential pullback in price soon.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.65 - This indicator measures the momentum of a stock's price. A positive PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating an upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)" - The signal suggests a buy rating, with a relatively small allocation and a monthly investment. The MRI suggests the market conditions are supportive, though the small allocation hints at underlying risk.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term decline) - This confirms that the divergence between BA and VOO is widening in the short-term.
*   **Expected Return:** -674.4% - This is a very concerning figure, implying a highly negative outlook for Boeing's long-term performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Analysis:** The indicators present a mixed picture. The MRI suggests favorable market conditions, while the RSI indicates Boeing is overbought. The hybrid signal suggests a buy, but the expected return paints a bleak picture.

*   **Boeing Wins $8.6 Billion F-15 Contract with Israel:** This is positive news, providing a significant revenue boost.
*   **Report Flags 737 MAX Production Push for 2026:** This is cautiously optimistic. Increased production is good, but execution is key given past issues.

*   **Cadinha & Co. LLC Holds $15.91 Million Stock Holdings:** This indicates institutional investment.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean 1.61)
*   **Target Price:** $245.76 (Average), $285 (High), $150 (Low)

**Analysis:** The consensus is "Buy" with a target price significantly above the current price. This indicates analysts generally see upside potential. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices reflects considerable uncertainty.
