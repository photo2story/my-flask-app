## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Boeing Co (BA), a major aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling aircraft, rotorcraft, rockets, and satellites worldwide.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Boeing's cumulative return of -24.03% significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 78.93%.  This results in a current divergence of -103.0%, placing it at the 11.3th percentile of its historical range (min: -129.7%, max: 106.1%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance and risk.  High CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values are observed in earlier periods (2015-2017, 2016-2018), but these are followed by substantial negative returns and high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) between 2018 and 2021. The consistently negative Alpha values since 2018 suggest underperformance compared to the market benchmark. Beta values generally remain high indicating significant market sensitivity. The market cap shows a decreasing trend, recovering only slightly in the most recent years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

Boeing's closing price is $172.37, a $6.06 increase from the previous close ($162.52).  This represents a significant short-term price jump.

* **5-day moving average:** $162.52
* **20-day moving average:** $160.23
* **60-day moving average:** $168.93

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, though this should be viewed cautiously given the overall longer-term underperformance.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 52.09 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 1.16 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -607.3% (This extremely negative figure strongly suggests significant downside risk over the long term relative to the S&P 500.  This should be carefully investigated for accuracy as it seems unusually low.)
The significant price increase ('change': 6.06) indicates a sharp upward movement, potentially a short-term bounce.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Revenue remains relatively stable around $25 billion, but EPS shows some fluctuation.  There doesn't appear to be a clear trend in earnings.  Note the duplicate entry for 2024-10-29.  Data inconsistencies should be checked.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-29 | 0.82 | 25.34 B$ |
| 2024-07-30 | 0.83 | 25.38 B$ |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.77 | 25.82 B$ |

| 2024-10-29 | 0.91 | 25.17 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information reveals significant volatility and concerns. Negative equity is observed in multiple quarters, raising serious concerns about the company's financial health. Profit margins fluctuate widely, shifting between substantial profits and considerable losses. While ROE (Return on Equity) shows high values in some quarters, this is likely distorted by the negative equity.  Further investigation into the causes of these financial fluctuations is crucial.


| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B | -10.43% |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B | -19.66% |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B | 7.29% |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B | 11.32% |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B | 12.25% |


| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B | 98.90% |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B | 26.20% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B | 8.01% |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B | 2.02% |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B | 0.13% |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Boeing's performance has been significantly underperforming the market, exhibiting high volatility and substantial financial risks.  The negative Alpha, high Beta, and inconsistent profitability raise serious concerns. While the recent price increase suggests a potential short-term upward trend, the long-term outlook, particularly given the negative expected return and the worrying financial statements, remains extremely cautious.  A deep dive into the reasons for the negative expected return and the negative equity is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Independent verification of data accuracy is also highly recommended.  This analysis highlights significant risk and strongly advises further due diligence before considering any investment in Boeing.
