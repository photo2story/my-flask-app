* **20-Day Moving Average:** $180.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $173.62

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible bearish trend.  The recent price increase (from the previous close) is relatively small compared to the moving averages, implying a muted positive momentum.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** -0.83 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -639.6% (This extremely negative value is concerning and needs further investigation. It's likely an error or based on an inappropriate model.)
* **Price Change:** The small recent positive change does not suggest a significant rebound or sharp decline.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-10-29 | $0.82 | $25.34 B     |
| 2024-07-30 | $0.83 | $25.38 B     |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.77 | $25.82 B     |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.91 | $25.17 B     |
| 2024-10-29 | $0.91 | $25.17 B     | *(Duplicate entry â€“ possible data error)*

There appears to be a slight downward trend in EPS and inconsistency in revenue figures.  The duplicate entry on 2024-10-29 needs clarification.  More data is needed for a conclusive analysis.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B    | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B    | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B    | 7.29%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B    | 11.32%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B    | 12.25%        |

Significant volatility in both revenue and profit margin. Negative profit margins in the last two quarters are a serious concern.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE          |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B     | 98.90%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B    | 26.20%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B    | 8.01%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B    | 2.02%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B    | 0.13%        |

Negative equity throughout the period is alarming.  ROE is highly volatile and doesn't provide a reliable indicator of profitability given the negative equity.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, showing considerable volatility and periods of substantial losses.  Negative profit margins, negative equity, and a highly volatile ROE raise serious concerns about the company's financial health.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but the extremely negative expected return (which requires further scrutiny) casts doubt on the potential for a significant turnaround in the near future.  A long-term investment strategy should carefully consider the inherent risks, especially given the financial data provided and the -639.6% expected return (likely inaccurate).  More thorough due diligence, including analysis of the company's debt levels, operational efficiency, and future market outlook is crucial before any investment decision.  The provided -639.6% expected return requires immediate verification.
