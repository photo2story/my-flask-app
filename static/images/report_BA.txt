**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Boeing Co (BA) is an American multinational corporation that designs, manufactures, and sells airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, telecommunications equipment, and missiles worldwide.  The company's stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **BA Cumulative Return:** -16.55%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 108.62%
* **Return Difference:** -125.17%  (This shows BA underperformed VOO by 125.17 percentage points.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 6.7% (This indicates BA's underperformance relative to its historical range against VOO.  It is relatively closer to the minimum divergence observed historically.)

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance against the market (VOO). While periods of strong outperformance (high alpha) are observed, there are also periods of significant underperformance (negative alpha) and high maximum drawdown (MDD). The beta fluctuates, suggesting variable sensitivity to market movements.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows some fluctuation, but no clear trend.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $154.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $160.95
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $175.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $174.34

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend. The recent price change (-$2.68) reflects a significant drop from the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 20.31 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory.)
* **PPO:** -1.77 (Indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.3 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -904.2% (This extremely negative expected return suggests a very pessimistic long-term outlook compared to the S&P 500, possibly due to inherent risk or other factors not fully captured in this analysis.)  It's crucial to understand the methodology behind this figure and treat it with considerable skepticism.

The significant negative price change highlights a potential downside risk. The sharp drop necessitates investigation into the underlying reasons.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-10-29 | $0.82 | $25.34B      |
| 2024-07-30 | $0.83 | $25.38B      |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.77 | $25.82B      |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.91 | $25.17B      |
| 2024-10-29 | $0.91 | $25.17B      |

There appears to be a duplicated entry for 2024-10-29.  Excluding duplicates, revenue shows relatively consistent figures, but EPS displays some volatility.  A more detailed analysis is needed to determine the factors driving this variation.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B     | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B     | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B     | 7.29%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B     | 11.32%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B     | 12.25%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity      | ROE           |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B     | 98.90%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B    | 26.20%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B    | 8.01%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $-17.01B    | 2.02%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B    | 0.13%         |

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability show significant fluctuations and negative equity in several quarters, indicating potential financial instability.  Further investigation into the causes of these variations is necessary. The high ROE figures in some quarters need to be carefully considered in the context of negative equity.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's stock is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but also a bearish momentum.  Earnings show some volatility, and financial statements reveal substantial fluctuation in revenue, profit margins, and equity, indicating potential risks.  The extremely negative expected return (-904.2%) should be treated with caution due to its unlikely magnitude, requiring a detailed examination of its calculation. Before making any investment decisions, a thorough review of Boeing's financial health, future prospects, and the underlying reasons for its recent poor performance is crucial.  The provided data suggests high risk.
