    *   **Resistance Levels:** The price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which could act as resistance levels.

**3. Technical Indicators & Market Risk**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 34.36 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.44 (Slightly Bearish)

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.4 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1393.6% (Very Negative)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** While the MRI suggests "Medium Investment", the Hybrid Signal suggests otherwise, indicating a more cautious approach.
    *   **RSI:**  An RSI of 34.36 is nearing oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity, but should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.
    *   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, indicating a slightly bearish trend.
    *   **Relative Divergence:** The recent decline in relative divergence reinforces the short-term downward trend compared to the S&P 500.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. It suggests that, based on the model, long-term investment is expected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.
    *   **Price Change Impact:** The significant price change today (Last-market information) is a notable positive catalyst and needs to be factored into the overall assessment.

    *   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have been volatile, with negative margins in some quarters and positive margins in others.
    *   **Equity:** The company has negative equity, which is a significant concern and can indicate financial distress.
    *   **ROE:** ROE (Return on Equity) is very high in some quarters, but this is likely due to the negative equity. ROE can be artificially inflated when equity is negative.

**6. 종합적인 요약 (Overall Summary)**

*   **Negative Performance:**  Boeing has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 historically.
*   **Recent Positive Catalysts:**  Recent news regarding potential orders from China and the possibility of FAA restriction lifts are positive developments. The large price jump reflects this.
*   **Mixed Technical Signals:**  The RSI is nearing oversold, which could indicate a potential buying opportunity, but the PPO is slightly bearish.
*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Model Pessimism:** Analysts have a "Buy" rating, but the model's expected return is extremely negative. This creates a major point of conflict.
*   **Financial Concerns:**  Negative equity is a major red flag and raises concerns about the company's financial health.  While recent revenue growth and positive profit margins are encouraging, the negative equity cannot be ignored.
*   **Risk/Reward:**  Boeing presents a high-risk, high-reward scenario.  The potential for a turnaround is evident in the recent news and analyst sentiment, but the financial risks and historical underperformance are substantial.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is warranted.
1.  Given the MRI of 0.9 (Medium Investment), and the very positive news/market reactions, a short-term 'Buy' strategy may be profitable.
2.  However, there is still significant risks for long term investments.
3.  A short-term investment of about 30% based on this analysis.
