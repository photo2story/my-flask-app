* **20-Day Moving Average:** $178.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $169.45

Boeing's substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, coupled with negative long-term expected returns and volatile alpha and beta values, raises significant concerns. While recent earnings show some stability and technical indicators suggest short-term bullish momentum, the negative long-term outlook and lack of key financial data make a strong buy recommendation difficult.  Further investigation and a more comprehensive financial overview are necessary before making any investment decisions.  The risk associated with investing in BA appears high given the current data.
