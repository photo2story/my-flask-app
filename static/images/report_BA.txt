## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Boeing Co (BA) is an aerospace company designing, manufacturing, and selling airplanes, helicopters, missiles, and space launch systems.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), BA significantly underperformed.  The cumulative return difference between BA (-6.42%) and VOO (121.78%) at the last data point is -128.2%. This places BA at the 5.6th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO (considering a range from -143.8% to 133.2%).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $173.17
* **Last Market Price:** $172.15
* **5-day Moving Average:** $168.13
* **20-day Moving Average:** $155.90
* **60-day Moving Average:** $153.32

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, the relatively small gap between the current price and the 5-day MA indicates potential for short-term consolidation or correction.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 77.47 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for price correction)
* **PPO:** 1.36 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.9 (Short-term upward trend)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, increasing the risk of a near-term price decline. The positive PPO and relative divergence confirm short-term upward momentum, but it is crucial to consider the overbought conditions signaled by the RSI.  The provided expected return of 0.0% for long-term (2+ years) investment relative to the S&P 500 indicates that at current levels the market does not expect BA to outperform the broader market. The given Last Market ($172.15) does not indicate a significant recent rapid movement (neither a surge nor a crash).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-10-29).  Focusing solely on the unique entries and reported numbers:

* **Revenue:** Shows inconsistent trends. Revenue fluctuated within a relatively narrow band ($25.17B - $25.82B) for the first three quarters. The most recent quarter is missing complete data.
* **EPS:** Shows inconsistent trend, with slight fluctuation between quarters. No clear upward or downward trend is readily apparent.

Without complete data and context (analyst expectations, industry benchmarks), a complete assessment of earnings performance is not possible.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Significant revenue fluctuations quarter over quarter are observed, along with large swings in profit margins (from -19.66% to 12.25%).  This highlights considerable volatility in the company's operational performance.

**Capital and Profitability:** Negative equity throughout the period suggests significant liabilities relative to assets.  ROE also fluctuates considerably, indicating inconsistent profitability.  The negative equity is a major concern requiring further investigation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Market Outlook:** This information is not provided.
* **Analyst Opinions and Performance Highlights:** This information is not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, and this has persisted for several years, according to the provided CAGR data. While recent price action suggests short-term upward momentum, technical indicators (high RSI) suggest potential for a near-term correction.  The company's financial statements show considerable instability in both revenue and profitability, along with persistently negative equity.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions hinders a comprehensive assessment.  Further analysis is needed, especially concerning the negative equity and inconsistent earnings, before making any investment decisions.  The provided data indicates high risk and uncertainty.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the underperformance against the S&P 500, volatile financials, and lack of positive news, a cautious approach is warranted.  Further due diligence is essential, including review of analyst ratings, competitor analysis, and detailed financial statement examination, before considering investment in BA. The negative equity is a serious red flag that requires immediate attention.  The information provided suggests significant risk, and a long-term investment strategy may not be advisable without further investigation and improved company performance.
