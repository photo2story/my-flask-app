    *   **Recent Relative Deviation Change:** Negative, confirming the short-term underperformance versus the benchmark.

    *   **Equity:**  Negative equity indicates that Boeing has more liabilities than assets, which is a cause for concern.
    *   **ROE:** High ROE in some quarters (especially 2024-12-31) is misleading when equity is significantly negative, as it can result in disproportionately high ratios that do not accurately reflect profitability.

*   **Underperformance:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**Recommendation:**

Given the numerous red flags (negative equity, underperformance, volatility, negative expected return), a cautious approach is warranted. **It is challenging to recommend an investment in Boeing (BA) based on this data alone.** More in-depth research and due diligence would be necessary to justify any investment.
