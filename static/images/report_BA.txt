The mixed news sentiment and volatility make Boeing a high-risk investment. The "Buy" rating from analysts might be based on potential turnaround prospects, but investors should conduct thorough due diligence before investing. Further investigation into the source of the negative equity and the drivers behind the negative expected return is crucial. The model's projection differs sharply from what analysts expect. It will be helpful to understand the factors affecting these different evaluations.
