**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B   | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B   | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B   | 7.29%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.57B   | 11.32%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $22.02B   | 12.25%        |

Profit margins are highly volatile, swinging between significant losses and positive profits.  This volatility needs further investigation to identify the underlying causes.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE          |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B   | 98.90%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B  | 26.20%       |

| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B  | 0.13%        |

Negative equity across all quarters raises significant concerns about the company's financial health. The ROE is highly volatile and doesn't offer a clear picture of profitability given the negative equity.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500, exhibiting negative alpha and considerable volatility in various financial metrics.  The company shows high risk according to the MRI, and negative PPO and a price trading below its moving averages indicate bearish momentum. While some short-term upward movement is evident, the overall picture suggests a concerning financial situation with volatile profitability and negative equity.  The extremely negative long-term expected return (-437.5%) requires clarification and further investigation. A more in-depth analysis is necessary to fully understand the underlying reasons for Boeingâ€™s underperformance and to assess the potential for future growth.  Further investigation into the drivers of the financial metrics (especially revenue and profit margin volatility and negative equity) is crucial before making any investment decisions.
