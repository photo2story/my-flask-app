**6. Overall Analysis:**

Boeing's performance has been significantly underwhelming compared to the S&P 500.  The company exhibits high market risk (MRI), negative momentum (PPO), and a negative expected return. Recent price movements, while showing a recent jump, are still below key moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. Financial statements show significant volatility and concerning negative equity figures.  While revenue remains relatively stable, profit margins and ROE fluctuate dramatically.  The negative expected return and high risk profile suggest caution. Before investing, a thorough investigation into the underlying causes of the company's underperformance and financial instability is necessary.  Considering the high risk and negative outlook, a long-term investment strategy should be carefully evaluated and should only proceed after thorough due diligence.
