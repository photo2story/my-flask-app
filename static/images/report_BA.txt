## Boeing Co (BA) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Boeing Co (BA), a leading aerospace company, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, exhibiting high volatility and negative alpha in several years.  While recent quarters show some improvement in profitability, the company faces ongoing challenges reflected in negative equity and fluctuating revenue.  Short-term price movements indicate potential instability. Long-term investment requires careful consideration of the inherent risks.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Boeing's cumulative return of -2.40% is drastically lower than the S&P 500's 120.25% return, representing a substantial underperformance.  The relative underperformance sits at the 7.7th percentile of its historical range, suggesting it's relatively close to its historical worst performance against the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals significant volatility in performance and risk.  While high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is observed in certain periods, massive Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight substantial risk.  Negative alpha values in multiple periods indicate underperformance relative to the market benchmark. Beta values fluctuate but generally suggest above-average market sensitivity.  Capitalization (Cap) shows fluctuations, partially reflecting the company's financial performance and market valuation.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $181.82
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $176.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $167.16

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent minor decline.  However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term upward trend.  The recent price change (-$0.06) is minimal and not indicative of a significant swing.

* **RSI:** 57.7  (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.10 (Slightly positive, suggesting bullish momentum)

* **Expected Return:** -766.7% (This extremely negative value needs clarification.  It is likely an error or requires additional context regarding the calculation method and timeframe.)

The technical indicators present a somewhat mixed picture. While the RSI suggests neutral momentum, the PPO and relative strength change hint at a slightly positive short-term trend. The extremely negative expected return warrants further investigation and clarification.

| 2024-10-29 | 0.91 | $25.17B     | *(Note: Duplicate entry)*


There's a slight downward trend in EPS in recent quarters, although revenue remains relatively stable around $25B.  The duplicate entry for October 29, 2024 needs clarification.

| 2023-12-31 | $-17.23B    | 0.13%         |

The financial data shows significant volatility and concerning negative equity in recent quarters.  Profit margins have fluctuated wildly, showing negative values in two of the last four quarters.  The extremely high ROE values in the last two quarters are noteworthy and require further investigation to understand the underlying drivers, considering the negative equity.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Boeing's performance has been significantly below the S&P 500, characterized by high volatility and periods of substantial losses.  While recent quarters show some improvement in revenue and profitability, negative equity and highly fluctuating financial metrics signal significant risk. The extremely negative projected return needs further scrutiny.  Before considering a long-term investment, a comprehensive review of the company's long-term strategic plans, addressing the challenges highlighted in the financial statements, is crucial.  A thorough understanding of the factors contributing to the significant volatility is essential for informed investment decisions.  The -766.7% expected return is likely an error and should be disregarded without further explanation and correction.
