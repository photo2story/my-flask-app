| 2023-2025  | -1.0%   | 69.7% | -54.0%  | -1.3   | 174.6  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Recent 3-year periods show negative CAGR, reflecting poor performance.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha in recent periods indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark, even when adjusted for risk.
*   **Beta:** Negative Beta suggests an inverse relationship with the market. However, given the overall underperformance, this may be less about Boeing acting as a hedge and more about specific company issues.
*   **Cap:**  Market Cap has fluctuated, reflecting the company's volatile performance.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Last Price:** 230.95
*   **Previous Close:** 229.61
*   **Change:** 0.58
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 231.94
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 231.02
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 222.62

**Analysis:**  The stock is trading slightly above its previous close. The price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but above the 60-day moving average. This suggests potential short-term weakness, but medium-term support. The recent small price increase may reflect positive news or market sentiment.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 42.36 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.19 (Slightly Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (4 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-02)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Short-term Decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** -1895.3%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The low MRI suggests that overall market risk is perceived as low, which could support investment in Boeing.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is below 50, indicating that the stock is not overbought but doesn't signal a strong buying opportunity either.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum, but the value is relatively small.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends a "Buy" with caution, indicating that the system sees potential upside, but considers the MRI level.
*   **Divergence Change:**  The decrease in relative divergence indicates worsening performance compared to the S&P 500 in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. It suggests the model anticipates significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon. The recent data {price': 230.95, 'previousClose': 229.61, 'change': 0.58} is a positive data.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Positive:** Boeing Stock Rises on Analyst Upgrade (Barrons.com, The Fly) - Analyst upgrades can drive positive sentiment and price movement.
*   **Neutral/Mixed:** Lockheed's Role in the Growing Space Economy (Zacks) - Indirectly relevant, indicating overall health in the aerospace sector.
*   **Negative:** Manufacturing Sees Job Losses (Manufacturing Dive) - Could indicate broader economic headwinds affecting Boeing.
*   **Positive:** Boeing's SAF Initiatives (Zacks) - Focus on sustainable aviation fuels is a positive long-term development.

**Analysis:** The recent news is mixed. While the analyst upgrades are encouraging, the broader economic concerns and the need to focus on sustainable initiatives add complexity.

### 4-2. Analyst Opinions

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean Rating: 1.65)
*   **Target Price:** 247.88 (Average)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Upgrades (Unspecified details)

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and an average target price above the current price. However, the lack of detail on recent rating changes (especially the magnitudes of the upgrades) makes it difficult to assess the conviction behind these recommendations.

### 5. Recent Earnings Analysis

| 날짜         | EPS  | 매출     |
|--------------|------|----------|
| 2025-07-31   | 0.9  | 26.46 B$ |
| 2025-04-30   | 0.91 | 27.37 B$ |
| 2024-10-29   | 0.82 | 25.34 B$ |
| 2024-07-30   | 0.83 | 25.38 B$ |
| 2025-07-31   | 0.83 | 25.38 B$ |

**Analysis:**  The EPS and revenue show some volatility. While there are some positives, there are inconsistencies in the data. A proper earning analysis needs consistent and accurate data.

### 6. Financial Information:

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30 | $22.75B  | 10.70%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $19.50B  | 12.40%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $15.24B  | -10.43%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.84B  | -19.66%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.87B  | 7.29%         |

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE       |
|------------|------------|-----------|
| 2025-06-30 | $-3.29B   | 18.54%    |
| 2025-03-31 | $-3.33B   | 1.11%     |
| 2024-12-31 | $-3.91B   | 98.90%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $-23.55B  | 26.20%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $-17.98B  | 8.01%     |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue has fluctuated over the past five quarters, showing some growth in recent periods.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have been inconsistent, with negative margins in two of the last five quarters. This indicates issues with profitability.
*   **Equity:** Negative equity is a significant concern, suggesting that Boeing's liabilities exceed its assets.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity is highly volatile, partly due to the negative equity. The high ROE in 2024-12-31 may be misleading due to the small base of negative equity.

### 7. Overall Assessment

Based on the provided data, Boeing presents a mixed picture:

*   **Negative Factors:**  Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative Alpha, high Maximum Drawdown, negative equity, and an extremely negative expected return are major concerns.
*   **Positive Factors:** Analyst upgrades and positive news regarding sustainable aviation fuel initiatives offer some hope. The low MRI suggests that overall market conditions may be supportive.
*   **Mixed Factors:** The recent price action is neutral, and the earnings data is inconsistent.

**Conclusion:**  While analyst upgrades and a low MRI might tempt investors, the negative financial indicators (negative equity, negative expected return, volatile profit margins) and consistent underperformance suggest a cautious approach is warranted. Further investigation into the company's financial health and operational challenges is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
