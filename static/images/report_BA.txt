The difference is a substantial -143.44%, placing it at the 2.02 percentile of the historical range of relative performance compared to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha and Beta values demonstrate periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market, fluctuating considerably over time.

The price of $146.1 is not significantly high enough to suggest a sudden rebound.  Given the negative indicators and the significant underperformance against the S&P 500, the expected return is 0.0% with significant downside risk.  Long-term (2+ years) investment through dollar-cost averaging may be considered but carries substantial risk given the stock's recent performance relative to the market.  The market outlook would need to significantly improve for there to be a chance of positive alpha relative to VOO.

A more detailed analysis, including projections and comparisons to analyst estimates, would be needed for a more informed outlook.  The company's recent financial performance has not provided reason for optimism in the short term.
