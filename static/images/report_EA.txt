**1. Performance Comparison:**

EA has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in the past. Its cumulative return of 81.8 is significantly lower than the S&P 500's 128.99.  The current relative divergence of -47.19, which translates to a 1.23 position on the relative divergence scale (ranging from -48.9 to 136.79), suggests that EA has been underperforming the S&P 500 compared to its historical performance. 

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing price:** $140.45
* **5-day Moving Average:** $144.48
* **20-day Moving Average:** $146.55
* **60-day Moving Average:** $145.10

These moving averages indicate a short-term downward trend, as the closing price is below all three moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 29.65
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.4

The RSI value indicates that EA is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound. However, the negative PPO value signals a downward price momentum. The recent 20-day relative divergence change of -5.5 further suggests a short-term downtrend. The Expected Return of 141.16% represents the potential maximum return over 5 years based on the current investment amount.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date | EPS | Expected EPS |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-07-30 | 0.52 | 0.4154 |
| 2024-05-07 | 1.37 | 1.52 |
| 2024-01-30 | 2.96 | 2.93 |
| 2023-11-01 | 1.46 | 1.25 |
| 2023-08-01 | 1.14 | 1.02 |

The most recent earnings report for the quarter ending July 30, 2024, shows that EA exceeded expectations, with an EPS of 0.52 compared to the expected 0.4154.  This suggests that the company's performance might be improving, despite the recent underperformance in the stock market.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

EA is currently facing a challenging market environment, as evidenced by its underperformance compared to the S&P 500. The stock's recent price movement and technical indicators suggest a short-term downtrend, while the RSI suggests possible oversold conditions and potential for a rebound. However, the positive earnings report for the most recent quarter indicates that the company's performance might be improving.  The Expected Return of 141.16% over five years suggests potential for long-term growth. Investors should consider these factors and monitor EA's future performance closely.

**6. Conclusion:**

While EA's recent performance has been underwhelming, the company shows signs of improvement, particularly in its most recent earnings report. The oversold conditions and potential for a rebound should be considered by investors. The long-term expected return of 141.16% is a positive factor for investors seeking long-term growth. Overall, EA's future prospects remain uncertain, and investors should continue to monitor the company's performance closely.
