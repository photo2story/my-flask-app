**Comprehensive Analysis**
Expedia Group has a strong return on equity (ROE) in recent quarters, indicating healthy profitability. However, the recent decline in stock price may be attributed to short-term market fluctuations. Despite this, the company's fundamentals justify the rally, according to Seeking Alpha. Analyst opinions are positive, with a mean rating of "Buy" and a target price of $288.38. The company's revenue has been growing, but profit margins seem to have declined in recent quarters. Overall, Expedia Group presents a compelling investment case with a mix of strengths and weaknesses.
