## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures:**

* **Cumulative Return (CRM):** 16.68%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 71.02%
* **Return Difference:** -54.3%
* **Relative Divergence:** 17.4% (This indicates that CRM's underperformance relative to VOO is in the 17.4th percentile of historical divergence between the two.)

**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Salesforce Inc. is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  While CRM has shown a positive cumulative return, it significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, lagging by 54.3%.  The relative divergence suggests this underperformance is relatively moderate compared to historical fluctuations.  Alpha values suggest consistent outperformance in specific periods, but the recent period (2021-2025) reveals a markedly higher Alpha which should be further analysed. Beta values consistently above 1 show high correlation to overall market movement.  Note the highly volatile CAGR and MDD (maximum drawdown) figures indicating high risk.


**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

The provided table shows significant variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different time periods.  While some periods show strong positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others exhibit significant negative CAGR and substantial MDD, highlighting the risk associated with CRM. The increasing Alpha values in recent years are concerning.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 37.0% | 56.6% | 7.0% | -0.0 | 97.7 |
| 2016-2018  | 44.0% | 64.9% | 27.0% | 0.3 | 130.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 45.0% | 64.9% | 16.0% | 0.6 | 155.4 |
| 2018-2020  | 43.0% | 64.9% | 13.0% | 0.5 | 212.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 46.0% | 22.7% | -28.0% | 0.6 | 242.9 |
| 2020-2022  | -92.0% | 66.4% | -112.0% | 0.7 | 126.7 |
| 2021-2023  | -41.0% | 66.4% | -70.0% | 2.4 | 251.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -35.0% | 67.9% | -50.0% | 2.8 | 321.3 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $240.76
* **Previous Close:** $255.23
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $261.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $274.68
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $306.34

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price drop of $5.67 (2.2%) indicates a relatively sharp decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 20.08 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.74 (Negative momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.9 (Short-term upward movement, but this is unlikely to last given overall context)
* **Expected Return:** -210.9% (This extremely negative figure needs further clarification regarding its calculation and assumptions. The timeframe "2 years or more" is also ambiguous, and it's essential to understand the methodology behind this projection. An Expected Return of -210.9% is unrealistic unless based on an extreme market crash scenario. The figure likely indicates a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 but does not reflect a realistic financial expectation.)

The low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum.  The high MRI reinforces the high-risk assessment.  The significant negative expected return highlights the substantial underperformance potential relative to the S&P 500, though the method used for this calculation should be clarified and should not be viewed as reliable without further verification.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue growth, but EPS figures show some slight inconsistencies. More information is needed about the accounting methodology to assess whether this variation is significant. The revenue shows only minor quarter-over-quarter growth.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) shows mixed signals. While revenue and profitability remain relatively stable, the stock price has recently experienced a significant decline and is significantly underperforming the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest bearish momentum and high risk.  The high alpha in the recent years is a positive, but needs further context and a proper risk analysis.  The exceptionally low projected return (-210.9%) requires immediate clarification on the methodology used for its calculation.  Before making any investment decision, a thorough analysis of the underlying reasons for the recent price decline and the extremely low projected return is crucial. Consider consulting with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.  The provided data alone isn't sufficient to provide comprehensive investment advice.
