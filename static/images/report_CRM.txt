**0. Key Figures:**

* **Cumulative Return (CRM):** 33.88%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 87.98%
* **Return Difference:** -54.1%
* **Relative Divergence:** 17.4% (indicates CRM's performance is relatively lower than VOO, but not in the lowest percentile of historical performance)

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  Over the observed period, CRM significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a -54.1% difference in cumulative returns.  While the relative divergence of 17.4% suggests it's not at its historical worst performance compared to VOO, it still lags considerably.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values over the years. While initially showing a slightly negative or neutral alpha (underperformance relative to the market),  it gradually increases to a significantly positive alpha from 2020 onwards (significantly outperforming the market). The beta is consistently high, indicating a high sensitivity to market movements.  The substantial negative CAGR values in recent years (-93%, -46%, -41%) are a significant concern and must be investigated further for the underlying causes.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $275.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $261.49

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent slight downward trend.  However, it's significantly above the 20-day moving average, indicating some short-term support. The recent price change (-$1.54) is a relatively small drop, and does not suggest a drastic market event.

* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +1.8 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -203.8% (This figure needs further clarification on the calculation methodology. A negative expected return of this magnitude is highly unusual and likely warrants further investigation).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue growth, with a slight dip in Q4 2023 and a subsequent rebound. EPS has fluctuated but generally maintained a relatively stable trend in recent quarters.  The repetition of the 2024-12-04 data point needs clarification; it seems to be duplicated.


| 날짜       | EPS | 매출         |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| 2024-12-04 | 1.6 | 9.44 B$       |
| 2024-08-29 | 1.48 | 9.32 B$       |

| 2024-12-04 | 1.26 | 8.72 B$       |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability indicators (revenue and profit margin) show a steady, upward trend.  Equity has fluctuated slightly, and ROE remains relatively stable but below 3%, suggesting room for improvement in capital efficiency.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) exhibits mixed signals. While fundamental indicators like revenue and profit margin show positive growth, recent stock performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500.  The high beta suggests substantial market sensitivity.  The negative expected return and significantly negative CAGR from 2020-2024 are major red flags requiring further investigation into the underlying reasons. Before making any investment decision, a thorough analysis of the causes of these negative trends is crucial.  The data provided does not offer sufficient context to accurately assess the long-term investment potential of CRM relative to VOO; the extremely negative expected return in particular is concerning and needs to be re-examined or explained.  More comprehensive financial modeling and analysis, considering various economic factors and risk assessments, are required for a robust assessment.
