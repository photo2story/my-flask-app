## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.

The cumulative return of CRM (153.21%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (120.36%).  The difference is 32.85%.  The provided relative outperformance (43.8%) indicates CRM's performance is in the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, note that the high and low values suggest significant volatility in the past.  The alpha consistently around 0.1 indicates a modest outperformance compared to the market after adjusting for risk, which is reflected in a beta around 0.1. The CAGR shows periods of exceptional growth, especially from 2017-2020, followed by significant downturn in 2020-2022 and recent recovery in 2023-2025. The high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight considerable risk associated with the investment in CRM.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $326.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $323.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $330.82
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $328.56

The price is slightly below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The 5-day moving average is significantly lower, indicating recent price decline and the recent price increase from the previous close ($324.56 to $326.84) is not significant enough to change the general trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 37.13 (Below 50, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.30 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.0 (Indicates a recent short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 8.1% (Long-term (2+ years) outperformance expectation relative to the S&P 500)

The RSI and PPO indicators both suggest bearish sentiment. The recent price change, while positive, is not substantial enough to counteract the negative trends indicated by the moving averages and technical indicators.  The 8.1% expected return is a long-term projection and does not account for short-term volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-12-04 | $1.6   | $9.44B       |
| 2024-08-29 | $1.48  | $9.32B       |

| 2024-12-04 | $1.26  | $8.72B       |


There seems to be a duplicate entry for 2024-12-04.  Assuming the correct data, revenue shows steady growth, with EPS fluctuating slightly.  Further analysis, including comparison to previous years' data, is necessary to draw definitive conclusions about earnings trends.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |

| 2023-10-31  | $8.72B  | 75.29%        |

Revenue is relatively consistent and shows slight growth over the past year. Profit margins are also consistently high, indicating strong profitability.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE       |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-10-31  | $58.52B  | 2.61%     |
| 2024-07-31  | $57.63B  | 2.48%     |
| 2024-04-30  | $59.68B  | 2.57%     |
| 2024-01-31  | $59.65B  | 2.42%     |
| 2023-10-31  | $58.09B  | 2.11%     |

Equity fluctuates but remains relatively stable.  ROE is moderately low, but consistent with recent history.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

CRM has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term. However, recent indicators point towards a short-term bearish trend. While the company shows strong revenue and profit margins, the recent price movement, technical indicators, and relatively low ROE suggest caution.  The high MDD in the past highlights considerable risk.  The 8.1% projected long-term outperformance should be considered in the context of this risk.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the 2020-2022 downturn and a deeper analysis of the earnings and financial data, particularly compared to previous years, are crucial before making any investment decisions.
