## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Salesforce (CRM) is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  The provided data shows a recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with significant volatility and a currently low RSI indicating potential oversold conditions.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

CRM's cumulative return (56.75%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (85.44%). The difference is -28.7%, placing it at the 15.5th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-55.1% to 114.7%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals varying performance across different periods.  While showing strong positive alpha and high CAGR in several years (indicating outperformance relative to the market), the recent periods (2020-2023) exhibit negative CAGR and high MDD (maximum drawdown), suggesting substantial risk.  The high Beta values in the most recent years imply high sensitivity to market movements.  The significantly increased Beta in recent years compared to earlier years is a key point to note and further investigate.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)  This suggests a moderate level of risk associated with the market's current state.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) is currently underperforming the S&P 500, showing significant volatility and a negative expected return.  While historical data suggests periods of strong growth and outperformance, recent years have witnessed substantial losses and high market sensitivity.  The low RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, but the negative PPO and substantial price drop indicate continued bearish sentiment.   The high Beta in recent periods is a major risk factor.  Before any investment decision, a thorough investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the validity of the -60.7% expected return is necessary.  Further analysis of the company's fundamentals and competitive landscape is crucial to properly assess the long-term investment potential.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data should be investigated and corrected.
