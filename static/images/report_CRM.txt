**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Salesforce's cumulative return (171.29%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.40%) by 50.89 percentage points.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, places it at the 54th percentile of its historical range (max: 130.9, min: -43.2).  The provided Alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance compared to the market benchmark (beta values indicate high market sensitivity).  However, significant negative returns were observed in the 2020-2022 period (-80% CAGR), illustrating the volatility of this stock despite its long-term growth potential.

* **Closing Price:** $348.82
* **5-day Moving Average:** $358.33
* **20-day Moving Average:** $339.27
* **60-day Moving Average:** $304.50

The closing price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend. The last market price ($356.68) shows a recent minor uptick.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Expected Return (26.8%):**  Implies a significant potential return above the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years),  assuming continued outperformance.  The discrepancy between the last market price ($356.68) and the closing price ($348.82) suggests a minor price adjustment after market close, which is not significant enough to be considered a sharp rebound or decline.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or analyst opinions are provided within the given data.  Further research is needed to obtain this information.  Lack of information about recent market outlook prevents a comprehensive analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) has demonstrated strong historical performance significantly outpacing the S&P 500.  Recent price action shows a potential short-term downturn, but long-term indicators remain positive, supported by consistent revenue growth and healthy profit margins. Technical indicators show a neutral sentiment.  The expected long-term return of 26.8% is compelling, but relies heavily on the assumption of continued outperformance relative to the S&P 500. Further investigation into recent news, analyst opinions, and earnings expectations is required for a more complete assessment.  The significant negative return during the 2020-2022 period serves as a reminder of the inherent risk involved.
