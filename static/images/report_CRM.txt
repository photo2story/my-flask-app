## Salesforce (CRM) Stock Analysis

**Company Overview:** Salesforce, Inc. is a global leader in cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software.

### 1.  Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **CRM Cumulative Return:** -0.0435 (-4.35%)
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 89.1820 (89.18%)
*   **Deviation (Current):** 108.1
*   **Relative Deviation:** 34.1 (This means the current deviation is in the 34.1th percentile of its historical range.)

**Analysis:** CRM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The negative cumulative return compared to the S&P 500's substantial positive return highlights this disparity. The relative deviation indicates that this underperformance is not at its worst historical level, but still concerning.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
| :----------- | :------ | :------ | :------ | :----- | :----- |

| 2018-2020  | 40.0%   | 64.7%   | 13.0%   | 0.1    | 211.8  |

| 2023-2025  | 12.0%   | 73.5%   | -42.0%   | -1.0   | 231.1  |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows fluctuating performance over different periods, with significant negative returns in recent years (2020-2025).
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values suggest significant volatility and potential risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Negative Alpha values in recent years indicate underperformance compared to its benchmark (risk-adjusted).
*   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuating, even negative ones, suggest CRM's price movements are not strongly correlated with the market. CRM's beta value is currently trending down.
*   **Cap:** Market capitalization shows growth followed by a decline in recent years.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** 242.76
*   **Previous Close:** 246.28
*   **Change:** -1.43
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 247.188
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 248.2905
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 255.9802

**Analysis:** The stock price is trending downwards, as it is below all three moving averages. The recent price decrease and the fact that the 5-day moving average is below the 20-day moving average, which is below the 60-day moving average, confirms a short-term downtrend.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3233 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 45.4783 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.0698 (Bearish - suggesting a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 278.6% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:** Despite the "Low Risk" MRI, other indicators paint a mixed picture. The negative PPO and negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence signal bearish short-term momentum. The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a cautious buy recommendation.  The very high expected return is promising, but should be viewed with skepticism and carefully considered against the other negative factors.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **AI Focus:** Several articles discuss Salesforce and AI, including AI-driven job cuts, Genesys investment talks, and the broader impact of AI on the IT industry. This suggests AI is a significant theme for Salesforce.
*   **Cramer's Analysis:** Jim Cramer is quoted regarding key metrics and the need for Salesforce to convince investors about its moat (competitive advantage).
*   **Insider Selling:** A Salesforce insider sold a significant amount of shares, which can sometimes be interpreted as a negative signal.
*   **Data Quality:** An article highlights the importance of data quality for AI products, which is relevant to Salesforce's AI initiatives.

**Analysis:** Recent news is mixed.  The AI focus could be positive if Salesforce executes well, but concerns about job cuts, the need to prove its competitive advantage, and insider selling are potential headwinds.

### 4-2. Analyst Opinions

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.60)
*   **Target Price:** Average 334.68 (Significantly above current price)

**Analysis:** Analysts are generally optimistic about Salesforce, with a consensus "Buy" rating and a target price substantially higher than the current price. However, the lack of recent rating changes suggests that the analysts did not change their positions lately.

*   **Equity and ROE:** Equity is also growing, and ROE is stable, although the latest quarter shows a slight improvement.

### 7. Overall Summary

Salesforce (CRM) presents a mixed picture. While recent earnings and revenue growth are positive, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest short-term bearish momentum. News headlines highlight both potential opportunities in AI and potential challenges (job cuts, competitive concerns, insider selling). Analyst consensus is positive, but should be taken with a grain of salt.

**In conclusion:** CRM may be a high-risk, high-reward investment at this time. The company shows strong revenue growth, but the recent underperformance against its benchmark is a concern.
