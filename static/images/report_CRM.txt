    *   The cumulative return of CRM significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO). The current divergence is -105.9%, indicating substantial underperformance. The "Relative Divergence" of 3.3 suggests that this underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range, meaning it's been worse in the past but is currently quite negative.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    | Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
    |------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|--------|

    | 2023-2025  | 1.0%    | 76.6%   | -62.0%  | -2.2  | 232.0  |

    *   **Analysis:**  The Alpha/Beta analysis shows a concerning trend.  While Salesforce had strong growth periods earlier, recent years show negative Alpha, indicating underperformance compared to its risk-adjusted benchmark.  Beta fluctuates, but the most recent period shows a significantly negative Beta of -2.2, suggesting a strong inverse correlation with the market (CRM tends to move in the opposite direction of the market). CAGR is also weak and MDD is high.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movements

*   **Current Price:** $243.66
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: $243.66, Previous Close: $240.43, Change: 1.34
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 243.264
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 251.3195
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 247.1892

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential short-term downward pressure. However, the price is above the 5-day moving average, indicating a very recent upward trend. The $1.34 increase from the previous close reflects some positive momentum.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 38.54  (Approaching oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.59  (Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00).
*   **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.3 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -1358.2% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is below 50, indicating bearish sentiment. The negative PPO further confirms a downtrend. The "Hybrid Signal" recommends a cautious buying approach with small, regular investments. The positive change in relative divergence over the past 20 days suggests a recent improvement in CRM's performance relative to the S&P 500, although the significantly negative "Expected Return" is a major red flag, suggesting very poor future returns compared to the market.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Key Headlines:**
    *   AI's impact on the future of work (Airbnb CEO's perspective).
    *   Past investment performance (3-year return of 66%).
    *   Tech layoffs.
    *   Institutional investment activity (HOTCHKIS & WILEY's portfolio moves).
    *   Market overview (Dow, Nasdaq performance).
    *   Acquisition of Doti (enterprise search company).

*   **Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. The acquisition of Doti is a positive sign of Salesforce's commitment to innovation.  The tech layoff news is a broader industry trend and may not directly impact Salesforce uniquely. Institutional investment could be a positive signal, but the past investment performance is likely based on a higher initial purchase price.

### 4-2. Analyst Opinions

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.66)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: $332.15 / High: $430.00 / Low: $221.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** None provided

*   **Analysis:** Despite the current underperformance, analysts remain generally positive on CRM, with a consensus "Buy" rating and a significant upside potential based on the average target price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices suggests some uncertainty.

*   **Analysis:**  Salesforce demonstrates robust revenue growth and strong profit margins consistently above 76%. Equity is steadily increasing, and Return on Equity (ROE) is also showing improvement, indicating better profitability relative to shareholder equity.

### 7. Overall Summary

Salesforce (CRM) is a company with strong fundamentals (revenue growth, high profit margins, increasing equity) and positive analyst ratings. However, its recent stock performance has significantly lagged behind the S&P 500. The negative Alpha, very negative Beta, and extremely negative expected return raise serious concerns about its near-term investment potential. The "Hybrid Signal" suggesting a cautious buying approach is probably most prudent, but the overall picture requires careful consideration of your risk tolerance and investment horizon. The recent acquisition and positive earnings reports are encouraging signs, but they need to translate into improved market performance.
