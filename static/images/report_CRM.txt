*   **Relative Divergence:** 2.4% (meaning CRM's relative performance is near the very bottom of its historical range compared to VOO).

**Analysis:** CRM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The large negative divergence indicates substantial underperformance relative to the market, and its low relative divergence position suggests this underperformance is near a historical extreme.

|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | 9.0%  | 76.6% | -55.0%| -1.6  | 242.8  |

**Analysis:**
*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows strong growth in earlier periods (2015-2019), but significant negative growth in more recent periods (2020-2024), with a slight recovery in the most recent period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Consistently high, indicating significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Significantly negative alpha in recent periods suggests underperformance relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark. This indicates that factors beyond general market movements are negatively impacting CRM's performance.
*   **Beta:**  Beta fluctuates, turning negative in the most recent periods. A negative beta suggests CRM has recently been moving in the opposite direction of the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):**  Increased over time, indicating overall growth in company size, although this growth may not be reflected in recent returns.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 263.41
*   **Last Market Data:** Price 255.05, Previous Close 256.64, Change -0.62
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 248.67
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 243.05
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 245.73

**Analysis:** The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the "Last Market Data" shows a recent small price drop. This could be a minor pullback or the start of a reversal.

### 3. Technical Indicators & Risk

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 69.81 (Approaching Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.91
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.6 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -1882.6% (Significant Underperformance Expected)

**Analysis:**
*   The high MRI suggests that, based on its model, this is considered a relatively safe investment *compared to other opportunities, not in absolute terms*.
*   The RSI nearing 70 indicates the stock may be approaching overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback.
*   The negative change in relative divergence reinforces the short-term downward momentum indicated by the recent price drop.
*   **Important:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. This suggests the model projects significant underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term.
*   Last market data price drop (change: -0.62) indicates a recent negative price movement, potentially signaling a short-term downward trend.

### 4. Recent News & Events

*   **AI Identity Protection for Agentforce (Varonis):** (Suggests increasing focus on AI and security within related ecosystems).

**Analysis:** The news is mixed.  The political headline could be a relief for the region, while the other news points to ongoing innovation and growth within the CRM and related technology sectors.

**Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.64)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 331.81 / 430.00 / 221.00

**Analysis:** Analysts are generally positive on CRM, with a "Buy" consensus and a significant average target price above the current price. However, the wide range in target prices (221 to 430) suggests considerable uncertainty in their outlook. The lack of recent rating changes suggests that analyst sentiment hasn't shifted dramatically recently.

### 7. 종합 분석 (Overall Analysis)

CRM exhibits a mixed picture:

*   **Strengths:** Strong revenue and equity growth, high profit margins, and positive analyst ratings suggest underlying business strength. Recent news items highlight innovation in the CRM space.
*   **Weaknesses:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative alpha, and a very negative expected return are major concerns. While the MRI suggests relatively lower risk compared to *other opportunities*, it doesn't negate the absolute risk presented by the negative expected return. The RSI indicates it may be approaching overbought territory.

**Conclusion:**

While CRM shows some positive fundamental trends, the significant underperformance relative to the market and the extremely negative "expected return" are serious red flags. The analyst consensus is positive, but their target prices vary widely, indicating uncertainty. Investors should proceed with caution and conduct further due diligence before considering an investment in CRM. The data strongly suggests CRM may underperform the overall market significantly in the long term.
