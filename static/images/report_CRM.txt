## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

Salesforce, a cloud-based software company, has shown significant growth in recent years, but its performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO) has been mixed. While exhibiting strong CAGR in certain periods, it also experienced substantial drawdowns.  Recent financial data reveals consistent revenue growth, though profit margins and ROE show moderate fluctuations.  The stock's current valuation relative to the S&P 500 is below average based on historical data.

In other words, CRM has underperformed the S&P 500, but not dramatically so compared to its historical range of performance relative to the index.

The data shows high volatility with significant swings in CAGR and MDD.

Market capitalization increased substantially over the period. The significantly higher Alpha and Beta in recent years suggest increasing risk and potential returns.

The negative expected return of -42% needs further investigation and clarification.  Further analysis is needed to fully understand the recent price drop and the drivers of EPS volatility.  Before making any investment decisions, a more thorough investigation into the fundamentals, including competitive landscape, growth prospects, and valuation, is crucial.  The provided data alone is insufficient for a definitive investment recommendation.
