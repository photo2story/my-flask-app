**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD  | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |

| 2023-2025  | -4.0%  | 76.6% | -70.0%  | -2.1   | 220.4  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate demonstrates a recent decline. Early periods (2015-2019) showed strong growth, but more recent periods (2020-2025) exhibit significant negative growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, ranging from 70.6% to 76.6%, indicating substantial potential for loss from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, measuring performance relative to a benchmark, has been negative in recent periods, especially sharply so in 2020-2025 indicating significant underperformance compared to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta, measuring volatility relative to the market, has fluctuated. The recent Beta values (2021-2025) are negative, suggesting that the stock has become less correlated to the market and its price moves are inverted (to a certain degree).
*   **Capitalization:** Market capitalization (Cap) has been fluctuating widely

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 230.54
*   **Previous Close:** 228.15
*   **Change:** 1.05
*   **5-day SMA:** 229.35
*   **20-day SMA:** 239.72
*   **60-day SMA:** 243.90

**Analysis:**

The current price is slightly above the 5-day SMA, but below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a short-term upward trend, but an overall downtrend in the medium-term.  The recent small price increase of 1.05 (versus previousClose) suggests that there is a small rebound.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.83
*   **PPO:** -0.44
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.4 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -4788.1%

**Analysis:**

*   The **MRI of 0.9** suggests that, based on this indicator alone, investment in CRM is considered relatively safe.
*   The **RSI of 40.83** indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold (oversold is generally considered below 30, overbought above 70).
*   The **PPO of -0.44** indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, suggesting a downtrend.
*   The **Hybrid Signal** recommends buying (100% of cash allocation). This seems at odds with other indicators. The indicator is showing it as "Very Safe" (based on the MRI).
*   The **recent negative change in relative divergence** confirms a short-term decline.
*   The **expected return of -4788.1%** is extremely negative and suggests that if these indicators were used, there is a very high probability of long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500 from the current price. This figure is significantly more negative than other indicators suggest, indicating the analysis tool may have some anomalies.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

The news headlines present a mixed picture:

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Citi Analyst slashes forecast with cautious feedback. Salesforce stock drops despite market gains. Opinions on recent performance decline. Stuck in reverse.
*   **Positive Sentiment:** Salesforce Is On Black Friday Sale - I'm Buying More Ahead Of Earnings (Rating Upgrade).

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.69)
*   **Opinions:** 50
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 328.37 / 430.00 / 221.00

**Analysis:**

Despite the recent negative news, the analyst consensus remains a "Buy" with a target price significantly above the current price. However, the target prices have a wide range, indicating uncertainty. The lack of information on recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the direction of analyst sentiment.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Salesforce's stock (CRM) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently. While revenue and profit margins are strong and growing, reflected in rising equity, the stock price has suffered. This discrepancy may be due to broader market sentiment towards growth stocks, specific concerns about Salesforce's future growth prospects, or a combination of factors. The high maximum drawdowns highlight the stock's volatility.

The analyst consensus remains a "Buy," but recent news is mixed, with concerns about future performance. The MRI suggests relatively safe investment, and Hybrid Signal recommends "Buy" signals, but the expected return is abnormally very negative, so it seems the analyzer tools have some issue.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the provided information, investment in CRM is risky at the current time. Investors should carefully consider the company's fundamentals, market sentiment, and their own risk tolerance before making a decision.
