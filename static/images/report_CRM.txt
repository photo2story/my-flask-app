*   The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a bullish stance, recommending using available cash to buy the stock, deemed safe by the MRI.
*   The recent positive change in relative divergence suggests a potential short-term upward trend.
*   The significantly negative expected return (-522.9%) is very concerning and suggests considerable downside risk if holding for more than two years.
