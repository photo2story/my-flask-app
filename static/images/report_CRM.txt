Recent price action shows a downtrend, but the Market Risk Indicator suggests a low-risk environment, and hybrid signal indicates potentially good opportunity for buying stocks with cash.

Financially, Salesforce has shown consistent growth in revenue and maintained strong profit margins. However, the high Maximum Drawdown and negative alpha in recent years indicate potential risks.

The highly negative expected return in long term should be noted.
