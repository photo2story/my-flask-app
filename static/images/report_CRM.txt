## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

Salesforce (CRM) shows a cumulative return significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO).  Recent price action indicates a downtrend, with key moving averages well above the current price.  Financial indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition but with concerns regarding expected returns.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Salesforce Inc. is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.

The cumulative return of CRM (13.85%) is substantially lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO) (72.42%), resulting in a significant negative divergence (-58.6%).  This places CRM at the 14.5th percentile of its historical range of divergence relative to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows mixed results. While CAGR is relatively high in most periods,  the high beta values (especially in recent years) highlight CRM's high sensitivity to market fluctuations. The negative CAGR and substantial Maximum Drawdown (MDD) in the 2020-2024 period demonstrate significant risk.

* **Change:** -$4.45 (a decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $248.57

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 31.99 (Approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential upward pressure, but not a definitive buy signal.)
* **PPO:** -0.1868 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.4 (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** -249.8% (This extremely negative expected return needs clarification. It's likely an error or requires further context on calculation methodology.  A negative return is possible, but this magnitude is highly unusual and warrants investigation).

The large negative daily price change and low RSI suggest the potential for a bounce, but the negative PPO and overall downtrend remain a concern.  The extremely negative expected return requires further explanation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) presents a mixed picture.  While the company demonstrates consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, its stock price significantly underperforms the S&P 500. The high beta highlights considerable market risk. Recent price action shows a downtrend, although some technical indicators suggest potential oversold conditions.  However, the extremely negative expected return needs urgent clarification.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough investigation of the expected return calculation and data discrepancies in the earnings report is crucial.  The high beta necessitates a careful consideration of overall portfolio risk tolerance.
