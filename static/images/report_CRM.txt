However, the relatively modest ROE warrants further investigation.  Long-term investors might consider accumulating shares given the long-term expected outperformance against the S&P 500.  Careful monitoring of the short-term trend is advised due to the negative momentum. Further due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate earnings data entry requires clarification.
