## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Report

**0) Overview:** Salesforce Inc. is a leading cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Salesforce (CRM) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for CRM is 152.21%, while VOO shows a cumulative return of 120.05%. This results in a difference of 32.2 percentage points.  Considering the provided historical range of this difference (max: 130.8, min: -43.3), CRM's current outperformance sits at the 43.4th percentile.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance across different periods. While Alpha generally indicates outperformance relative to the market (positive values), the high Beta values (especially in 2016-2018 and 2021-2023) reveal a high correlation with market movements, implying significant market risk.  The high volatility and dramatic shifts in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) throughout the years highlight the risk associated with this investment.  Note the exceptionally negative CAGR in 2020-2022.

**6) Summary:**

Salesforce (CRM) exhibits strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. However, this performance is characterized by high volatility and significant risk, as evidenced by the fluctuating CAGR, MDD, and Beta.  Recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, although the RSI is near neutral.  The high profit margins and relatively stable revenue are positive indicators.  Before making any investment decision, it's crucial to carefully consider the inherent risks associated with CRM's high Beta and historical volatility,  especially in light of the recent negative CAGR period.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data point is necessary.  The projected 8.3% expected return should be considered within this risk context.
