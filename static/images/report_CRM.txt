Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Salesforce (CRM) based on the data you provided, broken down into sections and summarized at the end.

**0) Report Structure**

*   **Simple Numbers First:** Present the raw data as given.
*   **Simple Analysis:**  Provide straightforward interpretations of the data.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Salesforce Inc. is a leading provider of cloud-based software solutions for customer relationship management (CRM).
*   **Return Rates:**
    *   CRM Cumulative Return: -11.92%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 100.58%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current Divergence: -116.9
    *   Relative Divergence: 0.0

**Analysis:** Salesforce has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The current divergence of -116.9 indicates a substantial difference in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 0.0 suggests the current divergence is at the very bottom of its historical range. This massive divergence may imply a buying opportunity if analysts expect CRM to eventually catch up with the S&P500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year      | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
| :---------- | :------ | :------ | :------ | :----- | :------- |

| 2019-2021 | 37.0%   | 71.9%   | -10.0%  | 0.7    | 265.4    |
| 2020-2022 | -78.0%  | 74.7%   | -78.0%  | 0.4    | 138.4    |
| 2021-2023 | -47.0%  | 76.6%   | -49.0%  | -0.6   | 274.8    |

| 2023-2025 | -1.0%   | 76.6%   | -66.0%  | -2.1   | 249.3    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows strong growth in earlier periods (2015-2021) but has declined significantly and turned negative in more recent periods (2020-2025).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility in the stock's price.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, which represents the excess return compared to the market, is negative in recent years, suggesting underperformance relative to the market.
*   **Beta:**  Beta fluctuates, but generally indicates CRM's price is less sensitive than the S&P 500 (Beta of 1). The recent negative Beta values suggest an inverse correlation with the market, implying CRM might move in the opposite direction of the S&P 500, however, these values are quite low.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has increased over time but has also fluctuated, reflecting market sentiment and company performance.

*   60-day SMA: 243.13

*   Expected Return (%): -4872.6 (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.)

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

*   **Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** CRM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial divergence in cumulative returns.
*   **Recent Positive Momentum:** Recent news, earnings, and analyst opinions suggest positive momentum, with a focus on AI adoption and a potential rebound.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Technical indicators are mixed, with the recent price increase and buying signal contrasted by the negative change in relative divergence.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts are generally optimistic, with a "Buy" consensus and a target price suggesting significant upside potential.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data presents a mixed picture. While CRM has underperformed the market, recent positive news, earnings, and analyst sentiment suggest a potential turnaround. The technical indicators are mixed, but the overall trend appears to be improving. However, the data point of expected return is so low that it may be an error.

**Caveats:**

*   The "Expected Return" of -4872.6% is an outlier and may be an error in the data. This requires further investigation.
*   The lack of recent rating changes might also indicate a lack of close scrutiny from analysts.
*   The analysis relies on the accuracy and completeness of the provided data.

Given these considerations, and keeping in mind your own risk tolerance, **a cautiously optimistic outlook on CRM may be warranted.** It's crucial to conduct further research and consider the potential risks before making any investment decisions. The significant divergence from the S&P 500 could represent a buying opportunity if Salesforce can execute its strategy and capitalize on its strengths.
