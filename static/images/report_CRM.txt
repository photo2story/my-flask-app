**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant variation in CRM's performance and volatility over time.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been consistently high in most periods,  the maximum drawdown (MDD) also demonstrates periods of considerable risk. Beta values fluctuate, indicating varying levels of correlation with the overall market.  Alpha, consistently around 0.1, suggests a small outperformance relative to the market benchmark, though this needs further context within the broader market conditions during those periods.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $333.88
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $330.51
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $329.74
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $330.90

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum.  However, it's very close to these averages which indicates that the upward trend is not strong.  The price is also just slightly below the 60-day moving average indicating potential for some short-term consolidation.  The recent price change of -$0.23 (-0.07%) is not significant enough to suggest any immediate dramatic upward or downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.51 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.28 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +2.8 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 7.5% above S&P 500. This suggests a potential for outperformance over the long term.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows generally increasing revenue and relatively stable EPS.  However, there appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-12-04.  A more consistent and accurate dataset would allow for a more robust analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce shows a strong long-term growth trajectory, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. However, the significant fluctuations in performance highlight inherent volatility.  The current valuation appears to be reasonably priced, considering the positive growth trends and the relatively neutral technical indicators.  The projected 7.5% outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) presents a compelling case for long-term investment, especially considering the company's leading position in the CRM market.  However, investors should be aware of the potential for substantial short-term price swings.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings entry and a more thorough examination of the company's competitive landscape are recommended before making any investment decisions.
