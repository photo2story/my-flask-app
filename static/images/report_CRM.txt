## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  The cumulative return for CRM is 179.79%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%. The difference is 50.9%, placing it at the 48th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests CRM has historically outperformed the market, but the relative outperformance is not at an extreme high.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high alpha values (ranging from 1.7 to 2.3) across all periods, indicating that CRM has historically generated returns exceeding the market benchmark (S&P 500) adjusted for its beta (volatility). Beta values are relatively high (around 2) reflecting higher volatility than the S&P500. However, note the negative CAGR of -7.4% and high MDD (maximum drawdown) of 55.4% in the 2020-2022 period.  This highlights the significant risk associated with CRM, despite its high alpha. Market capitalization has grown considerably over time.
