### 3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return

*   **RSI:** 20.32 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.06

*   **Expected Return:** -2217.4% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A reading of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation based on risk.
*   **RSI:**  An RSI of 20.32 indicates that CRM is currently oversold, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, though it could also mean price will go down more.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO value supports the downtrend indication from the moving averages.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Hybrid signal shows current over-selling status, it recommends using 100% of your cash to buy (4 shares)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** The positive change in relative divergence suggests that CRM's performance relative to the S&P 500 has improved somewhat recently, indicating a potential short-term upward movement.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is concerning.  It suggests that, even with long-term, regular investment, underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated.  This may warrant investigation into the methodology behind this calculation.
*   **Price Change Impact:** The "change" of 0.77 from the previous close isn't large enough to indicate a significant volatility event on its own.
