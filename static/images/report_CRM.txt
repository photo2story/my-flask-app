*   **CRM Cumulative Return:** -5.95%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 99.81%
*   **Divergence:** Current divergence of -104.8 (Relative Divergence: 7.0) indicates a significant underperformance of CRM compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The relative divergence of 7.0 suggests that the current divergence is near the lowest end of its historical range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuates significantly, ranging from -78% to 39% over different periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, around 70-76%, indicating substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Highly variable. Negative Alpha in recent periods (2018-2025) suggests underperformance relative to the market on a risk-adjusted basis. Positive Alpha in the earlier periods (2015-2018) indicates outperformance relative to the market on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Varies between -2.1 and 0.7. Fluctuations in Beta values indicate the stock's varying sensitivity to market movements.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization):** Generally increasing over time, showing growth in company size.

**Analysis:** The data suggests that CRM's performance has become more volatile and less aligned with the market in recent years. High MDD values underscore the inherent risk associated with the stock.

**2) Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Last Market Data:** Price increased slightly (0.13) compared to the previous close.

*   **60-day SMA:** 245.5237

**Analysis:** The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The price has recently broken above the 20-day and 60-day averages, indicating potential short-term bullish momentum.

**3) Index Indicators Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment) suggests a moderate level of risk associated with the stock.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 68.75 suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.7128, indicates a positive trend, but not excessively so.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "Buy 90% of cash" suggests a bullish signal based on the algorithm, considering the MRI.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** +4.8 (short-term increase) supports the short-term upward trend mentioned earlier.
*   **Expected Return:** -633.6% indicates a very negative long-term outlook based on the model's calculations.

**Analysis:** Mixed signals. The MRI and Hybrid signal suggest some bullish sentiment, but the high RSI hints at a potential pullback. The very negative expected return is a significant concern.

**Conclusion:**

CRM presents a complex investment picture. While recent financial performance and analyst sentiment are positive, the stock has significantly underperformed the market and exhibits high volatility.  The extremely negative expected return and the recent stock price decline related to AI concerns should be carefully considered. Investors should weigh the potential for future growth against the inherent risks and market underperformance before making an investment decision. The conflicting signals suggest a cautious approach is warranted.
