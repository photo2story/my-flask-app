## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Review

**0. Overview:** Salesforce is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period.  The cumulative return for CRM is 117.08%, while VOO's is 108.62%, resulting in a difference of 8.46%. The relative divergence, considering historical volatility, sits at 29.8%, indicating that the current outperformance is relatively higher than the minimum in the past but significantly lower than the maximum.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures, indicating strong historical growth. However, significant volatility is evident, with substantial Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) in some periods (e.g., -89% in 2020-2022).  The Beta values fluctuate, suggesting sensitivity to market movements, with a notably higher Beta in recent years (1.6 and 1.7), indicating increased market sensitivity.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) demonstrates considerable company growth. Note that the high alpha values, particularly in 2021-2025, imply significant outperformance against the benchmark.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $282.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $288.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $309.86
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $328.89

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price drop of $3.16 from the previous close signals a short-term negative trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 17.21 - This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is due, but not guaranteeing one.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.93 - A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.8 - This confirms the short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 15.3% -  This suggests a potential outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) through a consistent investment strategy.  This should be considered in light of the historical volatility shown in the Alpha/Beta analysis.

The significant price drop (-1.10) from the previous close reinforces the short-term negative trend.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, this does not automatically predict an immediate rebound.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Salesforce (CRM) shows strong long-term growth potential, indicated by high historical CAGR and a positive long-term expected return.  However, the stock is currently experiencing a short-term downturn, evidenced by its price being below key moving averages, a low RSI, and a negative PPO.  The high volatility and significant MDD in past years highlight the inherent risk. Investors should carefully consider the historical volatility and current market conditions before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the inconsistency in the EPS data is recommended.  The high long-term expected return should be viewed cautiously given the recent price decline and the potential for further market correction.
