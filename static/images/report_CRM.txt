2025-12-28 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the Salesforce (CRM) stock analysis based on the provided data:

**0) Overall Summary**

Salesforce (CRM) is currently underperforming the S&P 500. However, recent news and analyst opinions are generally positive, highlighting AI opportunities. The technical indicators are mixed, and the expected return is negative. Recent earnings and financial data show strong revenue and profitability, but the stock is considered risky based on the MRI.

**1) Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Salesforce Inc is a leading provider of cloud-based software solutions for customer relationship management (CRM).
*   **CRM Cumulative Return:** -1.84%

*   **Divergence:** -105.0 (Relative Divergence: 7.0)

**Analysis:** CRM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period reflected in the cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 7.0 indicates that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range, suggesting this level of underperformance compared to VOO is not unprecedented.

*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown remains consistently high, indicating significant potential for loss from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, which represents the excess return compared to the market, is largely negative in recent years, contributing to the underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta is unstable from period to period and turned negative in recent periods, indicating a potential inverse correlation with the market.

*   **20-day SMA:** 255.75
*   **60-day SMA:** 248.01

**Analysis:** The stock price is trending upwards, as indicated by the current price being above all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, and the 20-day SMA is above the 60-day SMA, which further confirms this upward trend. The modest increase from the previous close suggests stable growth.

*   **RSI:** 59.24

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.6 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -639.9%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite a high MRI recommending investment, this contradicts the poor performance. This could indicate a potential undervaluation.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 59.24 indicates that the stock is approaching overbought territory but isn't there yet.
*   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO suggests the stock is in a short-term uptrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests buying a significant portion of available cash (90%), but uses a lower MRI for its calculation.
*   **Recent Divergence:** A negative change in relative divergence indicates a short-term decline in performance compared to the benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return is a major concern. It suggests the model predicts substantial losses if holding long-term from this point.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

*   **Underperformance:** CRM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Positive Catalysts:** Recent news and analyst ratings are positive, driven by optimism around AI and perceived undervaluation.
*   **Financial Strength:** Revenue and profitability metrics are strong.
*   **Technical Signals:** Technical indicators present a mixed picture (upward price trend confirmed by SMAs; high RSI approaching overbought territory, slightly positive PPO.)
*   **Risk:** The MRI indicates high investment recommendation, but the negative expected return suggests caution.
*   **Divergence Analysis:** The history divergence analysis suggests potentially undervalued conditions.

**Recommendation:**

The data presents a complex picture. While financial performance and analyst sentiment are positive, the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 and the significantly negative expected return are major causes for concern.

A potential investment strategy could be a small, speculative position, given the positive catalysts. The negative expected returns and past negative Alpha should urge extreme caution and further investigation.
