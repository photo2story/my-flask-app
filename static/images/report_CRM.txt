    *   **CAGR:**  Compound Annual Growth Rate.  Notice the significant drop in recent years, and a relatively low growth rate in the latest period.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown. High MDD values (above 70%) indicate significant risk and volatility.

    *   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A Beta around or below 0 in recent years is somewhat unusual; it implies that CRM has become less correlated with the market.

The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA, further reinforcing this bullish signal.  The recent price increase of 0.8 is not particularly large, indicating relatively normal fluctuations.

*   **Expected Return (%):** -691.4%

    *   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests a moderate level of risk.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 75.66 indicates that the stock is overbought, meaning it may be due for a correction or pullback.
    *   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests an upward trend, but the value is relatively low.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggesting buying 90% indicates a moderately bullish outlook, aligning with the MRI.
    *   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence suggests that the stock has been underperforming compared to its history.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-691.4%) is highly concerning. This suggests a significantly pessimistic outlook for the stock's future performance relative to the S&P 500.
