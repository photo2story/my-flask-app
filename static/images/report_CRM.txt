## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:** Salesforce (CRM), a leading cloud-based software company, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) recently. While showing some positive recent earnings growth, its current valuation and market sentiment suggest caution.  Key indicators like RSI and PPO signal potential undervaluation, but significant risks remain.


**1) Performance Comparison:**

Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a leading provider of cloud-based software and services for customer relationship management (CRM).

* **Cumulative Return (CRM):** 17.09%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 76.31%
* **Return Difference:** -59.2%
* **Relative Divergence:** 14.1% (This indicates CRM's underperformance relative to VOO falls within the lower 14.1% of historical divergence ranges).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance of CRM relative to the market (Beta), with periods of outperformance and significant underperformance. Notably, the high beta values in the recent years (2021-2025) reflect CRM's increased volatility relative to the market.  Alpha, which measures excess return above the market benchmark, has fluctuated widely, demonstrating periods of significant outperformance and severe underperformance.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in earlier years is counterbalanced by considerable losses later on.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures highlight significant risk.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 41.0% | 59.0% | 9.0%  | -0.0 | 102.1 |
| 2016-2018  | 43.0% | 64.9% | 22.0% | 0.1  | 136.8 |
| 2017-2019  | 43.0% | 64.9% | 9.0%  | 0.7  | 162.4 |
| 2018-2020  | 32.0% | 64.9% | 2.0%  | 0.7  | 222.2 |
| 2019-2021  | 44.0% | 61.2% | -17.0%| 0.7  | 253.8 |
| 2020-2022  | -93.0%| 69.2% | -102.0%| 0.9  | 132.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -46.0%| 69.2% | -66.0%| 2.2  | 262.8 |
| 2022-2024  | -41.0%| 69.2% | -62.0%| 2.5  | 335.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 13.0% | 73.4% | -1.0% | 2.8  | 244.8 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $243.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $246.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $258.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $292.08

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price increase of $3.02 compared to the previous close suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the overall trend remains bearish.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.85 (Suggests oversold conditions, potentially signaling a bounce but not necessarily a strong reversal.)
* **PPO:** -0.14 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -1.4% (Indicates a recent short-term weakening of relative performance against VOO.)
* **Expected Return:** -258.9% (This extremely negative value requires further clarification.  The context is unclear as to if this is a calculated expectation based on a particular model,  and it is highly unusual.  If it is based on market outlook, there must be a very high level of bearish sentiment.)

The recent price increase of $3.02 (approximately 1.3%) shows a small upward shift and does not constitute a significant "rapid rebound" or "rapid decline."

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce's performance has been mixed. While showing consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, its stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest potential undervaluation, but the extremely negative expected return warrants further investigation.  The high volatility and inconsistent Alpha and Beta suggest considerable risk.  Long-term investment (2+ years) may be considered, but only after a thorough assessment of the underlying factors driving the negative expected return.  The current market sentiment towards CRM needs careful consideration before any investment decision.  The provided -258.9% expected return is exceptionally low and needs further clarification regarding its calculation and underlying assumptions.
