## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  The cumulative return for CRM is 174.25%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 119.94%. The difference is 54.3%, placing it at the 56.1st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data (max: 130.8, min: -43.3).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows that CRM generally exhibits a higher CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) than the market (implied by the positive alpha), but with significant volatility, as reflected in the Maximum Drawdown (MDD).  The beta, largely above 1, suggests higher volatility than the market. The exceptionally negative CAGR in 2020-2022 highlights the risk associated with this stock.

* **Closing Price:** $354.0
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $345.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $331.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $333.78

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, the recent closing price shows a decrease of $1.65 compared to the previous close (a slight negative change), indicating some potential price correction.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 71.47 (Approaching overbought territory;  potential for price correction)
* **PPO:** 1.12 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** +10.5% (Short-term upward trend)

The current price change shows a slight decline. This minor drop isnâ€™t significant enough to be classified as a sharp decline.  The expected return of 5.3% over the long term (2+ years) represents an outperformance of the S&P 500, but this is dependent on various market conditions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) shows strong long-term growth potential relative to the S&P 500, evidenced by its significantly higher cumulative return. However, it also exhibits considerable volatility, as highlighted by its high beta and past maximum drawdowns. The current price is above its moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  Technical indicators (RSI nearing overbought) suggest a potential correction.  Fundamental analysis indicates strong revenue and profitability, but further investigation into the EPS and the duplicated earnings data is necessary. The high expected return relative to the S&P 500 warrants consideration for long-term investors, but it's crucial to acknowledge the inherent risk associated with this stock.  Thorough due diligence, including a comprehensive understanding of the company's future growth prospects, is recommended before investing.
