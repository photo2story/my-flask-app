While CRM has shown a strong cumulative return of 65.28%, it underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by 24.5% based on the provided data.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values.  High alpha values (e.g., 1.8 and 1.9 in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024) suggest outperformance relative to the market during those periods, while negative alphas indicate underperformance.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **MRI:** 0.44 (Medium Risk) indicates moderate market volatility.
* **RSI:** 43.02, below 50, suggests the stock is currently oversold.

This projection needs further investigation and should be considered with caution.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) shows a mixed picture. While revenue and profit margins are healthy and growing, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 in the recent past, as highlighted by the negative long-term expected return.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, and a potential for bullish momentum.  However, the significantly negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and the conflicting data provided for December 4th, 2024, along with the projected negative return warrant caution.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies and the basis of the long-term negative expected return is essential before making any investment decisions.  A more thorough fundamental analysis, including examination of competitive landscape, future growth prospects, and management strategy, is needed for a comprehensive evaluation.
