## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures:**

* **Cumulative Return (CRM):** 26.94%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 82.57%
* **Return Difference (CRM vs VOO):** -55.6%
* **Relative Divergence:** 16.4% (Indicates CRM's performance is relatively weaker than VOO, but not at its historical worst)


**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Salesforce Inc. is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  Compared to the S&P 500 (represented by VOO), CRM's cumulative return significantly lags behind. The -55.6% difference highlights underperformance, although the relative divergence suggests this is not an extreme outlier in its historical context.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods.  While Alpha is mostly positive (indicating outperformance relative to the market), it becomes significantly higher in more recent years (2021-2025), suggesting increased market sensitivity (high beta) and potentially higher risk.  The highly negative CAGR in 2020-2022 is a significant concern.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values also indicate substantial risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) shows mixed signals. While revenue and profitability are strong, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years, displaying high risk (indicated by high beta, MDD, and negative CAGR in certain periods). The recent price movement suggests a possible short-term recovery, but the longer-term outlook remains uncertain.  The extremely negative expected return requires further investigation and clarification.  The substantial historical drawdowns and the recent high beta suggest caution before investing.  A thorough examination of the -215.8% expected return is crucial before drawing any conclusions about long-term investment strategies.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the company's strategic direction and competitive landscape, is recommended before making investment decisions.
