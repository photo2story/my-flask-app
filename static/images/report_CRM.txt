**5. Financial Information:**

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Salesforce (CRM) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in recent periods, showing a considerably negative long-term expected return compared to the index. While recent earnings indicate revenue growth, the lack of crucial financial data and the negative expected return raise significant concerns. The high beta suggests high volatility and sensitivity to market downturns. The medium-risk MRI coupled with the negative long-term expected return signals caution. Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the reasons behind the negative expected return and the missing financial data is crucial.  A deeper dive into the company's strategy, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is necessary to form a more informed opinion.
