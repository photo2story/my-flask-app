## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Review

This report analyzes Salesforce Inc., a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Salesforce's cumulative return (115.33%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (104.98%) by 10.3 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 31% indicates that its current performance is in the higher range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, considering its historical range of -43.4% to 129.6%.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures, particularly between 2016 and 2020, demonstrating strong growth. However, 2020-2022 experienced a substantial negative CAGR (-80%), indicating a period of significant underperformance.  The Beta values generally hover above 1, suggesting higher volatility than the overall market,  with a recent increase in Beta, potentially indicating increased market sensitivity. The consistently high Beta values emphasize the risk associated with CRM.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $280.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $279.70
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $286.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $317.13

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price increase of $0.57 (from $279.03) is a small positive change.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.8 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.30 (Positive, indicating upward momentum, but close to neutral)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.2 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 14.4% (above S&P 500)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests potential for a rebound, the negative relative divergence and the price being below its moving averages suggest caution. The positive PPO supports potential upward momentum.  The expected return of 14.4% is promising for long-term investors.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Salesforce shows strong long-term growth potential, supported by consistent revenue growth and a positive expected return compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent performance has been volatile, with periods of significant underperformance. The relatively high Beta indicates higher risk.  The current price is below several key moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. Investors should carefully consider the inherent risk associated with CRM's higher volatility before making investment decisions.  Further in-depth analysis, including a thorough evaluation of the company's competitive landscape and future growth prospects, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data requires clarification and potential correction.
