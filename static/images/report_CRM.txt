    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR fluctuates significantly across different periods. The earlier periods (2015-2019) show strong growth, while the more recent periods (2020-2024) show substantial declines.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is consistently high across all periods, indicating significant volatility and risk.
