**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  Over the analyzed period, CRM significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return of 18.39% compared to VOO's 61.39%.

Alpha values consistently positive after 2017 (2.5 in 2023-2025) suggest outperformance relative to the market, but this is heavily influenced by negative performance in 2020-2022.  The high Beta values (above 1) indicate significant market sensitivity.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) shows signs of both strength (consistent revenue growth, high profit margins) and weakness (significant underperformance against the S&P 500, bearish technical indicators, and a dramatically negative long-term expected return that needs further explanation/justification).  The recent price drop adds to the bearish sentiment. While the company demonstrates financial stability, its market performance raises concerns. The extremely negative long-term expected return (-158.5%) is a significant red flag and needs further scrutiny regarding its calculation methodology.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough review of the methodology behind the expected return calculation and a deeper dive into the company's strategic direction and competitive landscape are crucial.  The oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the overall picture suggests caution.
