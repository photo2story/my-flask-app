The cumulative return for CRM is 172.96%, while VOO's is 120.85%. This represents a difference of 52.1 percentage points.

Beta values fluctuate significantly over time, implying varying sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the reporting date, CRM's closing price is $350.97.  The 5-day moving average is $355.08, indicating a slight recent downward trend. The 20-day moving average is $344.93, and the 60-day moving average is $312.35. This suggests a recent upward trend, with the price currently above its 20-day moving average but slightly below its 5-day average.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (54.17):** Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral short-term momentum.
* **PPO (-0.37):** A negative value suggests bearish momentum in the short-term.  The negative PPO, in combination with the slightly lower 5-day moving average relative to the price, could signal a minor pullback.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+0.7):**  This points to a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (28%):** A projected 28% return over the long term (2+ years) surpasses the expected S&P 500 return, suggesting significant potential for outperformance.  However, this projection should be considered with caution, as it relies on assumptions not fully specified here. The current price of $350.97 doesn't indicate any significant recent sudden price movements.

EPS has also shown growth, albeit with some fluctuation, particularly the drop in Q4 2023. The reported EPS values don't indicate any massive or easily definable pattern, and a more detailed analysis and the inclusion of expectations data would be needed to identify beats or misses.
