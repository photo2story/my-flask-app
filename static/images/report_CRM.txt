## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Analysis

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  The provided data reveals a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over a specific period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind this underperformance and assess future prospects.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** CRM: 16.01%, VOO: 58.02%

Although the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the inconsistent past performance and significant negative returns in recent years raise considerable concerns. A long-term investment strategy would require careful consideration of these risks, and a thorough assessment of the reasons for the significant underperformance compared to the broader market is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data requires further clarification and potentially more robust analysis to fully understand the future trajectory of CRM's stock price.
