*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is negative in the more recent periods, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:**  Beta fluctuates, suggesting varying degrees of correlation with the market. The negative beta in the later years would imply the price moves inversely with the market, but the value is too low to have any relevance.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movements

*   **Current Price:** 251.37
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 251.14, Previous Close: 254.26, Change: -1.23
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 254.67
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 246.47
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 245.39

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages.  The recent price decrease (-1.23) suggests a short-term downward trend.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 58.23
*   **PPO:** 0.4655
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (4 shares)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 3.7 (+) (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -783.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  The high MRI suggests that, based on the model, the stock is considered relatively safe for investment despite other concerning metrics.
*   **RSI:**  An RSI of 58.23 indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum.
*   **PPO:**  The Positive Percentage Oscillator (PPO) is positive, which may indicate bullish momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Recommends a full investment of available cash, indicating a buying opportunity.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The increase in relative divergence suggests a recent improvement in performance compared to the benchmark, but the overall divergence is still highly negative.
*   **Expected Return:** **This is a HUGE RED FLAG.** An expected return of -783.1% is extremely negative and suggests the model anticipates massive underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term.

**Important Consideration:** The negative change (-1.23) from the previous close is relatively small and doesn't necessarily indicate a significant volatility event.

### 7. Overall Summary

**Key Positives:**

*   Growing Revenue and EPS
*   High and Stable Profit Margins
*   Positive Analyst Consensus (Buy) and Target Price Suggests Upside
*   High MRI (Market Risk Indicator) suggesting low risk
*   Recent Short term increase

**Key Negatives:**

*   Significant Underperformance vs. S&P 500
*   Negative Alpha (recent periods)
*   Insider Selling
*   The **Extremely Negative Expected Return (-783.1%)** is a major concern.

**Overall Assessment:**

Salesforce exhibits a mixed picture. While revenue, earnings, and profit margins show positive trends, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative alpha, and especially the extremely negative expected return are serious concerns. The model clearly sees significant risk over a longer time horizon.  The mixed analyst opinions and insider selling add to the uncertainty.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals and the extremely negative expected return, **caution is advised.** Further investigation into the factors driving the negative expected return is warranted before making any investment decisions. The high MRI suggesting low risk, is not in line with any other factors that point towards potentially significant downward pressure on the price. There may be a data anomaly so would require additional data to fully asses the current situation with complete accuracy.
