This suggests CRM has generally outperformed the market over the considered period, though this is not a guarantee of future performance.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided CAGR of 150% over 2015-2025 significantly exceeds the market, supported by a positive alpha (0.33) and high beta (0.1).

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) demonstrates strong long-term growth potential, supported by consistent revenue growth and high profit margins.  While recent short-term indicators suggest a potential bearish trend, the oversold RSI and historically strong performance relative to the S&P 500 warrant consideration.  The high beta indicates higher risk associated with its market sensitivity.  The projected 8% long-term outperformance against the S&P 500 is promising but relies on future market conditions.  Further investigation into the EPS fluctuations and a thorough risk assessment are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The current price is near a potential support level given it's position relative to moving averages.  This analysis is based on provided data and does not constitute financial advice.
