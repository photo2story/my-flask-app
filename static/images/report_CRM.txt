*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility in CRM's returns.
*   **Alpha:** The alpha values are largely negative in recent years, meaning CRM has underperformed relative to its benchmark, even considering the risk-free rate.
*   **Beta:** The beta values have been increasing over time, particularly in recent years. A beta greater than 1 suggests that CRM's price is more volatile than the market as a whole.

**Analysis:**

The price has increased slightly from the previous close. The 5-day and 20-day moving averages are below the current price, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the 60-day moving average is above the current price, indicating potential resistance and a possible longer-term downward trend.

**Key Numbers:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 49.01 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.28 (Close to zero, indicating consolidation)

*   **Expected Return (%):** -3491.7%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The low MRI indicates that, according to this specific indicator, the overall market risk is currently low.
*   **RSI:** The RSI value is close to 50, which typically suggests a neutral market sentiment without strong overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The PPO being close to zero implies that the price is consolidating.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence suggests a recent short-term decline in CRM's performance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is concerning and might be an outlier or indicative of serious issues in the underlying model's assumptions. It's essential to understand the basis for this projection, as it indicates a very bleak outlook for CRM compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.
*   **Last-market Issue:** The price change suggests slight positive momentum, though not substantial.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_1%_Buy 80% of cash (13 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33). This means just buy a little due to lower MRI.

The MRI indicates a low market risk environment, but the very negative expected return raises serious concerns and warrants further investigation.

*   **Underperformance:** CRM has lagged the S&P 500 significantly.
*   **Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility and risk.
*   **Financial Health:** Revenue, profit margins, and equity show positive trends.

*   **Market Sentiment:** News and analyst discussions point to potential volatility.

**Recommendation:**

Given the underperformance, high volatility, and concerning expected return, a cautious approach is warranted. Investors should closely monitor the stock, paying attention to upcoming earnings reports, news, and analyst commentary. Further due diligence is crucial to understand the factors driving the negative expected return and to assess whether the stock represents a viable investment opportunity.
