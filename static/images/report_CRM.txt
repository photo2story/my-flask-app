**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 324.93
* **Last Market Price:** 326.41
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 330.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 342.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 324.22

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a possible bearish trend.  However, the Last Market Price is slightly above the Closing Price, suggesting potential short-term upward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 20.62 (Significantly oversold; potential bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.95 (Negative; bearish signal)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -6.0% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 40.0% (Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 expected)

The low RSI suggests the stock is oversold and may be due for a rebound. However, the negative PPO and negative relative divergence indicate a bearish short-term trend. The high expected return suggests strong long-term potential despite the current bearish signals.  The slight difference between the Closing Price and Last Market Price isn't significant enough to suggest a dramatic price swing (no rapid increase or decrease observed).
