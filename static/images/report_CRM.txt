**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $335.78 (Last Market: $341.67)
* 5-Day Moving Average: $326.48
* 20-Day Moving Average: $314.47
* 60-Day Moving Average: $285.48

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The recent drop from $341.67 to $335.78 indicates a minor pullback.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* RSI: 74.98 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction)
* PPO: -0.03 (Slightly negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* 20-Day Relative Strength Change: +19.0 (Strong short-term upward momentum)
* Expected Return (2+ years): 0.87% (This represents an *excess* return over the S&P 500;  not a total return.)

The high RSI value warrants caution, despite the positive short-term momentum. The negative PPO suggests a weakening trend, counteracting the positive relative strength change. The modest expected return exceeding S&P 500 performance needs further analysis considering the overbought RSI.  The $341.67 price is not significantly different from the current close to suggest an extreme movement like a rapid surge or fall.
