* **CRM Cumulative Return:** 20.31%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 78.93%
* **CRM vs. VOO Return Difference:** -58.6% (This indicates CRM significantly underperformed VOO.)

**1. Company Overview and Performance Analysis:**

Salesforce Inc. is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  The provided data shows CRM significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, lagging by 58.6 percentage points.

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of CRM varied significantly over different periods, ranging from a high of 44% to a drastic -93%. The high volatility is further highlighted by the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures, reaching as high as -102%.  Alpha consistently positive (except 2015-2017) suggests outperformance after adjusting for market risk (beta).  However, the recent negative performance and high beta values in the last few years (2021-2025) indicate considerable sensitivity to market movements.  The market cap also showed fluctuations, reflecting the company's performance volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $250.48
* **5-day Moving Average:** $245.45
* **20-day Moving Average:** $256.53
* **60-day Moving Average:** $290.48

The price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price increase of $2.91 (from $243.39) might be a temporary bounce, as it is still significantly lower than the recent averages.  It is important to note this is a short-term perspective.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 39.58 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so.)
* **PPO:** 0.1083 (Positive, suggesting potential bullish momentum, albeit weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.3% (Short-term downward trend relative to the market)
* **Expected Return:** -250.7%  This figure needs clarification.  It's likely a miscalculation or misinterpretation of the data.  A negative percentage this large is not realistic.
* **Long-Term Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** Cannot be reliably determined from the given data. The historical volatility and the significant underperformance relative to the VOO in recent years make projecting future alpha difficult.  A long-term investment requires a thorough analysis of Salesforce's business prospects, competitive landscape, and management strategy.


**Conclusion:**

Salesforce (CRM) has shown considerable volatility and has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently. While some indicators like positive Alpha (in most years) and a relatively low RSI hint at potential recovery, the sustained underperformance and high beta warrant caution. The high volatility and negative recent performance suggest a high-risk investment. A long-term investment decision should incorporate a detailed fundamental analysis to assess future prospects considering the current macro-economic conditions and the company's strategic direction. The provided "Expected Return" value requires clarification.  Further analysis is required before making any investment decision.
