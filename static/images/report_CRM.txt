| 2023-2025  | -5.0%  | 76.6% | -64.0% | -2.1  | 217.1  |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows volatile performance, ranging from positive growth in earlier periods to significant negative growth in recent years.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.  MDD is in the 70+% range for all timeframes, meaning investors have experienced significant losses at some point during each period.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is trending negatively, especially in recent periods, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark.  It suggests CRM is not generating excess returns compared to what would be expected based on its risk (Beta).
*   **Beta:** The Beta values fluctuate but have become negative more recently, meaning the stock is not moving in tandem with the market, and it's less sensitive to market movements. A beta of -2.1 in the 2023-2025 timeframe is particularly concerning, indicating a strong inverse relationship with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization, measured in billions, has fluctuated, showing a decline more recently, reflecting the market's reaction to the company's recent performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Previous Close:** \$225.37
*   **Change:** \$0.77
*   **5-day SMA:** 230.18
*   **20-day SMA:** 244.48
*   **60-day SMA:** 245.40

*   **Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below all its Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is closest to the current price, while the 60-day SMA is furthest away, suggesting continued downward pressure.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 20.32 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.06
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.4 (Negative, indicating a short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -4788.1% (Very Negative)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The RSI of 20.32 suggests that the stock is oversold and could be due for a bounce.
    *   The PPO (-1.06) indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, further confirming the downtrend.
    *   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium investment is recommended
    *   The "Hybrid Signal" is recommending a full investment of available cash, indicating high confidence. This contradicts the recent divergence and expected return.
    *   The very negative Expected Return suggests significant long-term risk.
    *   The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days aligns with the downtrend observed in the SMAs.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Overall, the analysis presents a mixed picture for Salesforce (CRM):

*   **Negative Signals:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   Negative alpha and a concerningly negative beta in recent periods.
    *   Downtrend in stock price, confirmed by SMAs.
    *   Very negative Expected Return.
    *   Analyst price target cuts and mixed news sentiment.
*   **Positive Signals:**
    *   Recent positive trends in revenue, EPS, profit margins, and ROE.
    *   Oversold RSI suggesting a potential rebound.
    *   Analyst consensus remains a "Buy," albeit with a wide target price range.
    *   A strong "Hybrid Signal" advocating a full cash investment, which is an outlier conflicting with other indicators.
*   **Conclusion:**

While recent financial performance shows some positive signs, the stock's underperformance, negative outlook, and analyst concerns warrant caution. The very negative "Expected Return" cannot be ignored. The current "Hybrid Signal" is a puzzling contradiction to other indicators. A potential opportunity exists if the company can address investor concerns, improve its outlook, and reverse the negative trends. Otherwise, investors should be wary, despite the "Buy" consensus from analysts. It is likely best to research the reasoning behind the Hybrid signal, as this is the only signal that advocates a buy, and seems to disagree with all other measurements.
