*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Varies significantly over different periods. Some periods show strong growth (41-44%), while others show substantial declines (-42% to -93%).  Recent performance (2023-2025) is positive but lower than historical highs.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, ranging from 58.5% to 73.5%, indicating significant risk and price volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Fluctuates from positive to negative, showing periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  Recent years show very negative alpha, suggesting underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Generally positive and increasing over time (especially in recent periods), suggesting CRM's price is becoming more sensitive to market movements (S&P 500).  A Beta above 1 (approaching 2.5) indicates higher volatility than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** The Market Capitalization is in Billions of dollars.

**Analysis:**
CRM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in the analyzed timeframe. The high MDD values across all periods highlight CRM's susceptibility to market downturns. Recent negative alpha values suggest CRM has struggled to deliver returns independent of the broader market. The increasing beta suggests that CRM's price movements are becoming more correlated with, and more volatile than, the overall market.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** 259.68
*   **Previous Close:** 258.07
*   **Change:** 0.62 (Slight positive change)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 264.52
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 266.50
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 269.51

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly up from the previous close.  However, it's below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a short-term downward trend.

### 3. Technical Indicators & Hybrid Signal

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3372 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 45.55 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.3295 (Slightly bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_69%_Sell 69.7% of holdings (428 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34) (Cash Ratio: 69% on 2025-07-14)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (Indicates a short-term decline in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3445.9 (Very negative, suggesting significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the long term)

**Analysis:**
The MRI indicates low market risk, but the negative PPO and the "Sell" hybrid signal suggest caution. The extremely negative expected return is concerning and warrants further investigation. The small positive price change of 0.62 may indicate a slight recovery.

### 7. Overall Assessment

Based on the provided data, Salesforce (CRM) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Underperformance:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in recent periods, is a major concern.
*   **High Volatility:** High MDD values and increasing beta suggest significant risk.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Mixed signals, with a low MRI but negative PPO and a "Sell" recommendation from the hybrid signal.
*   **Financial Strength:** Strong revenue, profit margins, and stable equity suggest a healthy underlying business.
*   **Recent News:** Indicates increased volatility and scrutiny, suggesting potential catalysts for future price movements.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Returns:** Further investigation is necessary to validate and interpret this value.

**Recommendation:**
Given the underperformance, high volatility, and negative expected return, a **cautious approach** is warranted. Investors should closely monitor upcoming news, earnings reports, and analyst opinions to assess whether the company can reverse its recent trends. The hybrid signal recommends a 69.7% sell-off of holdings, aligning with the cautious outlook. A potential investment opportunity may arise if CRM can demonstrate a sustained turnaround in its relative performance and improve its technical indicators.
