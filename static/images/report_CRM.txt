**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) exhibits a history of strong growth but with periods of significant volatility.  While the recent price action shows a slight downward trend, the long-term outlook, suggested by the high expected return and generally positive earnings, remains potentially bullish, especially for long-term investors.  However, the relatively high beta suggests a need for risk tolerance, and the recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500 warrants attention.  Further investigation into the drivers of the 2020-2022 downturn and the recent increase in alpha would provide a more complete picture.  The data indicates the need for a balanced approach, weighing the substantial potential for growth against the inherent risk of investment in a volatile stock.
