### 7. 종합 Analysis

**Summary:**

CRM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently. While recent price action shows some short-term positive momentum, the long-term underperformance and negative alpha values are concerning. The company exhibits strong revenue growth and high profit margins, but these haven't translated into superior stock performance.  Recent news suggests increased volatility. The extremely high projected long-term return should be viewed cautiously.

**Overall Assessment:**

CRM appears to be a company with strong fundamentals (revenue growth, high profit margins), but the stock's recent performance has been disappointing compared to the broader market.  Increased volatility and uncertainty surrounding company events warrant careful monitoring. While technical indicators suggest some short-term positive signals, the long-term outlook is less clear. Investors should conduct further due diligence, paying close attention to company news and analyst reports.
