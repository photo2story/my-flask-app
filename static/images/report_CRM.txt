*   **Alpha:**  Negative Alpha in recent periods suggests underperformance relative to its risk-adjusted expected return.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values fluctuating but negative recently, suggesting the stock's volatility relative to the market has changed, even indicating an inverse correlation (though the negative beta is quite high).

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** 235.69
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 238.88, Previous Close: 235.69, Change: 1.35

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is below all three moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend. The recent price increase from 235.69 to 238.88 is a positive sign, but needs further observation to confirm if it's the start of a trend reversal or just a temporary rebound.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 35.75 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.34
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-02)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.9 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -4606.4% (Significant underperformance vs. S&P 500 over 2+ years)
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Despite the High Investment Recommended MRI, the negative expected return and the short-term decline signal caution.
    *   RSI suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity if other factors align.
    *   The Hybrid Signal suggests a conservative approach, recommending full investment of available cash but a low monthly investment.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **AI Focus:** Several headlines emphasize Salesforce's push into AI (Missionforce, healthcare, life sciences) and analyst focus on AI performance.
*   **Partnerships:**  New partnerships (Perficient, ZS acquiring Torrent Consulting) indicate continued efforts to expand service offerings.
*   **Software Laggards:** One headline ("More Pain Ahead for Software Laggards?") suggests potential challenges for the software sector in general.

Further monitoring of the AI initiatives, market trends, and future earnings reports is necessary before making a definitive investment decision. Consider a small initial investment to test the waters while observing performance.

**Korean Summary:**

제공된 자료에 따르면 Salesforce (CRM)은 S&P 500에 비해 실적이 매우 저조하며 단기적으로 하락 추세에 있습니다. 예상 수익률 또한 부정적입니다. 하지만 최근 실적 발표와 재무 데이터는 매출, 주당 순이익, 이익 마진 및 ROE가 개선되고 있음을 보여줍니다. 분석가들의 컨센서스는 긍정적이며, AI 분야 진출과 새로운 파트너십이 긍정적인 촉매제가 될 수 있습니다. 이러한 혼합된 신호들을 고려할 때, 중립적인 입장을 유지하는 것이 좋습니다. 투자 결정을 내리기 전에 AI 이니셔티브, 시장 동향 및 향후 실적 보고서를 추가적으로 모니터링해야 합니다. 성과를 관찰하면서 소규모 초기 투자를 고려할 수 있습니다.
