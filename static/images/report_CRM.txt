*   **Divergence:** -116.9% (Relative Divergence: 0.0%)

*Analysis:* CRM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The -116.9% divergence indicates a substantial difference in returns. The relative divergence of 0.0% suggests the current divergence is at the most negative point within the observed range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown (around 70%), meaning large potential losses for the price of investment.
*   **Alpha:** Positive Alpha in earlier periods, reflecting outperformance relative to a benchmark. However, Alpha is strongly negative in recent periods (2020-2025), reflecting underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates, but generally indicates CRM's volatility relative to the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Represents market capitalization in Billions

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **The Bad:** CRM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. The historical performance shows large maximum drawdowns and a recent history of strongly negative Alpha. Expected return based on the model is massively negative.
*   **The Good:** Recent earnings reports show an EPS spike and consistent revenue growth. Analysts maintain a "Buy" rating with substantial upside potential. The stock price is currently above its short and medium-term moving averages, suggesting a possible uptrend. Recent news sentiment is improving.
*   **Conclusion:** The data presents a mixed picture. While historical performance and model expectations are concerning, recent positive earnings, analyst ratings, and market momentum offer potential for a turnaround. However, investors should be aware of the high risk and volatility associated with the stock. The recent price jump needs to be sustained by more than just one earnings report to confirm a true reversal. Further investigation into the reasons behind the historical underperformance is crucial before making an investment decision. The massive negative Expected Return from the model deserves careful consideration.
