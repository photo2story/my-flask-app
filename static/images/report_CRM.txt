## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  The provided data shows a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with a substantially higher cumulative return.  However, recent price action indicates potential weakness.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this performance.


**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500:**

* **CRM Cumulative Return:** 120.49%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 108.99%
* **Return Difference:** 11.5%
* **Relative Divergence:** 31.5% (This indicates CRM's current outperformance relative to its historical range of outperformance/underperformance against VOO.)

The provided alpha and beta values show varying levels of outperformance (alpha) and market sensitivity (beta) across different time periods. Noteworthy is the significant negative return in 2020-2022 (-80% CAGR), followed by strong recovery.  The high beta suggests CRM's price is highly correlated with overall market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $287.34
* **5-day Moving Average:** $296.10
* **20-day Moving Average:** $317.96
* **60-day Moving Average:** $332.71

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent price drop of $1.95 from the previous close further supports this bearish sentiment.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 19.92 (Significantly below 30, indicating oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** -1.11 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.6% (Short-term bearish trend.)

The significant negative price change (-$1.95) points to a short-term price drop rather than a sharp decline, reflecting the general market weakness.  The expected return of 14% over the long term (2+ years) represents a potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this needs to be viewed in light of the current market conditions and the substantial volatility shown in the provided data.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  While the company demonstrates consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, the low RSI and negative PPO indicate oversold conditions.  The 14% expected long-term return is promising, but investors should be aware of the potential for continued volatility, especially given the high beta.  Further investigation is needed to resolve the duplicated earnings data entry and to assess the sustainability of long-term growth considering the recent market downturn and CRM's high market sensitivity.  A cautious approach, considering diversification and risk tolerance, is recommended.
