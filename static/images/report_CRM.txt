**1. Performance Comparison:**

Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  Over the measured period, CRM significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a cumulative return of 26.94% compared to VOO's 82.57%. This represents a difference of -55.6%. The relative divergence of -55.6% falls within the historical range, placing it at the 16.4th percentile, indicating it's relatively underperformed compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values over different time periods.  While alpha was initially negative or slightly positive, it increased significantly in recent years (2021-2025), reaching a value of 2.8. This suggests that while initially underperforming the market (negative or low alpha), CRM's performance has become increasingly less correlated with market movements (high beta), potentially influenced by company-specific factors.  The high beta suggests substantial risk. The consistently high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights the significant risk associated with investing in CRM, especially in recent years.  This high risk is also reflected in the negative CAGR values in the recent period.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 41.0% | 59.0% | 9.0% | -0.0 | 97.5 |
| 2016-2018  | 43.0% | 64.9% | 22.0% | 0.1 | 130.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 43.0% | 64.9% | 9.0% | 0.7 | 155.2 |
| 2018-2020  | 32.0% | 64.9% | 2.0% | 0.7 | 212.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 44.0% | 61.2% | -17.0% | 0.7 | 242.5 |
| 2020-2022  | -93.0% | 69.2% | -102.0% | 0.9 | 126.5 |
| 2021-2023  | -46.0% | 69.2% | -66.0% | 2.2 | 251.1 |
| 2022-2024  | -41.0% | 69.2% | -62.0% | 2.5 | 320.8 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

CRM's current price is $264.70, showing a recent increase from the previous close of $250.48. The price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (55.09):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (0.65):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):**  A positive change of 0.3 indicates short-term upward momentum.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** The value of 0.4053 falls into the medium risk category.
* **Expected Return:** A projected negative return of -215.8% relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a significant concern.  This extremely negative expected return requires further investigation to understand the underlying assumptions and potential biases.

The recent price change of $5.68 reflects a notable increase, but given the broader trend indicated by the moving averages, this might be a temporary bounce rather than a significant reversal of the downward trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows generally increasing revenue and relatively stable EPS, though there's some fluctuation quarter to quarter. The most recent quarter shows a slight dip in EPS, but overall there is consistent growth in revenue suggesting healthy business growth in spite of the share price performance.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-12-04 | 1.6 | 9.44 B$ |
| 2024-08-29 | 1.48 | 9.32 B$ |
| 2024-05-30 | 1.58 | 9.13 B$ |
| 2023-11-30 | 1.26 | 8.72 B$ |
| 2024-12-04 | 1.26 | 8.72 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability indicators show consistent growth over time. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) remains relatively low and fluctuates slightly quarter to quarter, indicating potential inefficiencies in capital utilization.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $9.99B | 77.81% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) shows a strong revenue growth trajectory and healthy profit margins. However, the stock's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, resulting in a large negative return differential.  The high beta and significant maximum drawdowns highlight the substantial risk associated with this investment. While short-term indicators suggest a potential upward bounce, the longer-term outlook, reflected in both the moving averages and the extremely negative projected return against the S&P 500, remains cautious. The -215.8% expected return is exceptionally negative and requires careful scrutiny of the underlying methodology.  Further investigation is needed to ascertain the validity of the expected return calculation.  Given the risk profile and the substantial underperformance against the market benchmark, a long-term investment strategy for CRM requires careful consideration of risk tolerance and the potential for continued underperformance.
