**Analysis:**

*   Salesforce significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined.

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The growth rate has varied significantly over the years, with negative rates in recent periods (2020-2025).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** MDD is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative recently, implying underperformance relative to its benchmark (S&P 500). In earlier years (2015-2018), the alpha was strongly positive.
*   **Beta:** Beta has decreased and even become negative, indicating that the stock's price movements are becoming less correlated with the S&P 500, and that it has become much less sensitive to market movements.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** The market capitalization has fluctuated.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **5-day SMA:** 263.86

*   **60-day SMA:** 248.01

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is currently slightly above its previous close, but above all the simple moving averages (5, 20, 60 day).
*   The SMA values suggest a recent upward trend, as the 5-day SMA is above the 20-day, which is above the 60-day.

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation.
*   The RSI is approaching overbought territory.
*   The PPO indicates a slightly upward trend.
*   The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy recommendation, but with the caveat of it being "safe".

*   The extremely negative expected return is concerning. This might be an anomaly or a sign of significant projected underperformance.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Salesforce (CRM) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Underperformance:**  It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the examined time frame. Its history of negative alpha in recent periods confirms this.
*   **Recent Positive Momentum:** Recent moving averages, earnings, and revenue growth suggest a potential turnaround.
*   **Analyst Optimism:**  Analysts have a generally positive outlook, with a "Buy" consensus and a target price significantly above the current price.
*   **Risk and Volatility:** High MDD values in the Alpha, Beta analysis table indicate high levels of volatility.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** The Hybrid Signal recommends buying. However, the extremely negative "Expected Return" figure warrants further investigation.  It's a strong outlier compared to the other data.
*   **News Sentiment:** The news sentiment is mixed to positive, indicating increasing confidence.
*   **Conclusion:** While past performance has been weak, recent trends and analyst outlook suggest potential for future growth. The high volatility and the anomaly of an extremely negative "expected return" suggest that it's necessary to perform additional analysis.
