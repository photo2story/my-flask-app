A cautious approach is warranted. Investors should carefully consider the factors contributing to the underperformance and the negative expected return. The upcoming Investor Day could provide valuable insights into the company's future plans and outlook. It would be prudent to monitor the stock's performance and news flow closely before making any investment decisions.
