*   **Recent Price Action:** Positive, above moving averages.
*   **Earnings & Financials:** Generally positive trends in revenue, EPS, and profit margins.

The strong recent price action and decent financial results are overshadowed by the significantly negative Expected Return and historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
