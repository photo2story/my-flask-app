Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided data for Salesforce (CRM), along with analysis:

**1. Comparative Return Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Salesforce Inc. is a leading provider of cloud-based software solutions for customer relationship management (CRM).
*   **Return Rates:**
    *   CRM Cumulative Return: -4.87%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 99.09%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current Divergence: -105.8
    *   Relative Divergence: 6.5 (meaning CRM is currently performing near its lowest relative to the S&P 500 in the observed period).

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD Table:**

The table provides insights into CRM's performance over rolling 3-year periods. Here's a breakdown:

*   **CAGR:** Shows strong growth in the earlier periods (2015-2019) but significantly declines and becomes negative in later periods (2020-2025). This indicates a slowdown in growth and recent underperformance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD values indicate substantial risk and price volatility associated with CRM. The drawdowns hovering around 70% consistently highlight downside risk in the stock.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the excess return compared to the benchmark (S&P 500).  Alpha is negative in more recent periods (2018-2025), which further emphasizes the underperformance relative to the market.
*   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. Beta fluctuates. Beta went to a negative value recently (-2.1 at 2023-2025), indicating Salesforce moves in the opposite direction to the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** General increase in market cap over the years, but with some recent volatility.

**Summary of Comparative Return Analysis:**

CRM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, especially in recent years.  The Alpha/Beta analysis highlights this underperformance and increased risk/volatility.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** $257.85
*   **Last Market Change:** Price increased slightly (+0.05) compared to the previous close.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 257.54
    *   20-day SMA: 246.87
    *   60-day SMA: 245.93

**Analysis:** The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The 5-day SMA is close to the current price, while the 20-day and 60-day SMAs are lower, suggesting sustained upward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 76.99 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.42
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (4 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)" This suggests a buy signal but with caution (given 0% cash allocation), based on the MRI.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.6 (Indicates short-term decline relative to the S&P 500).
*   **Expected Return (%):** -691.4 (Very negative – projects significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a longer term).

**Analysis:**

*   **Overbought RSI:** An RSI above 70 often signals that the stock may be overbought and could be due for a correction.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting analysts believe CRM is likely to underperform substantially.
*   **MRI Contradiction:** While the MRI suggests a "Medium Investment," the "safe" designation is questionable given the other indicators.

*   **Target Price:** Average: $330.06 (Significantly higher than the current price).

*   **AI Focus:** The emphasis on AI in the news suggests this is a critical area for the company's future.
*   **Risk Factors:** The high MDD from the Alpha/Beta analysis highlights potential price volatility.
*   **Recent trend:** The change in Beta value (negative number), relative divergence change (negative number), and expected return (very negative) suggest analysts have a negative outlook for Salesforce.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in CRM at this point appears risky. The strong analyst consensus and positive financial metrics must be weighed against the concerning technical indicators, negative expected return, and recent underperformance. The focus on AI and future growth will be crucial for Salesforce to reverse its current trajectory. A potential investor should conduct further due diligence and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing.
