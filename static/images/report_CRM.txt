## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  The cumulative return of CRM is 179.77%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 130.06%. The difference is 49.7%, placing it in the 47.3rd percentile of historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500 based on provided data (max 148.9%, min -39.5%).  The provided alpha consistently shows 0.0, suggesting the outperformance may not be consistently attributable to manager skill, but rather to sector-specific factors or market movements.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows variable performance across different years, with high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in some periods offset by significant negative returns in others (e.g., -86% CAGR from 2020-2022).  Beta is consistently high (above 1), indicating high volatility correlated with the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Price:** $331.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $336.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $325.14
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $292.72

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting some recent downward pressure. However, it sits above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term support level.  The discrepancy between the last reported closing price ($329.99) and the last market price ($331.06) suggests a minor price fluctuation post-market close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 55.00 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in neutral territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.38 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** NaN –  Missing data.  The mention of short-term decline, however, aligns with the negative PPO.
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 47.8% over the long term (2+ years) – This suggests a significant potential for outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, the data from the alpha calculations indicate inconsistencies that should be considered.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows mixed trends:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally increased quarter-over-quarter, though the growth rate appears to have slowed slightly in recent quarters.
* **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** EPS fluctuates and has not shown a clear upward trend. There is no obvious pattern of consistent growth.
* **Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison:** There's no clear consistent trend between consecutive quarters; it lacks significant and continuous upward movement.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity fluctuates slightly and ROE (Return on Equity) remains relatively low and inconsistent, demonstrating variability in returns relative to invested capital.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions are provided in the initial prompt.  To complete this section, up-to-date news sources on Salesforce's recent earnings announcements, market outlook, and analyst ratings should be consulted.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce has demonstrated significant long-term outperformance against the S&P 500, however, the reliability of this outperformance is in question given consistently reported zero alpha.  Recent price action shows short-term weakness.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with the RSI showing neutrality and the PPO suggesting bearish momentum.  Financial statements indicate consistent, but not necessarily growing, profitability and stable revenue.  The long-term expected return remains positive compared to the S&P 500, although the historical volatility and inconsistent growth rate should be considered.  Further analysis is necessary, incorporating current market sentiment and recent news, to provide a more comprehensive assessment.  The inconsistency of returns should be the primary focus of additional investigation.  Crucially, the provided information lacks context regarding the market's overall performance during the periods analyzed and expectations at the time of each earnings announcement.  More data would be needed to form a complete analysis of whether earnings are actually beating or missing expectations.
