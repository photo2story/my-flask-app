### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** 252.05999755859372
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 242.57, 'previousClose': 252.06, 'change': -3.76}
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 251.11
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 246.813
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 256.8707

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages but above the 20-day moving average. The Last Market data reveals a recent price decrease, which is significant (nearly 4% drop). This suggests recent negative momentum.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Market Risk

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3261 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 56.31
*   **PPO:** 0.4496
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** -0.2 (Negative)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1699.6

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates Low Market Risk. The RSI is near neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is slightly positive, hinting at a weak upward trend. The hybrid signal suggests a Buy, but with caution due to the MRI. The recent decrease in relative spread indicates short-term underperformance. The extremely negative expected return is very concerning, suggesting a potentially significant long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if current trends continue.

The significant price drop indicated by `{'price': 242.57, 'previousClose': 252.06, 'change': -3.76}` reinforces the negative short-term momentum.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Target Price:** 334.68 (Avg), 430.00 (High), 221.00 (Low)

### 7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Assessment)

Overall, the analysis paints a mixed picture for Salesforce (CRM).

*   **Negative Signals:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, recent price decline, negative short-term momentum, concerningly negative long-term expected return, and analyst target price reductions.
*   **Positive Signals:** Strong revenue and EPS growth in the latest quarter, high profit margins, increasing equity and ROE, generally positive analyst consensus (though with wide target price ranges). Low MRI.

**Conclusion:** While Salesforce shows signs of strong underlying business performance and growth, the negative market indicators and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 are causes for concern. The extremely negative expected return warrants careful consideration. Investors should closely monitor the company's future performance and the impact of AI-related initiatives on its growth trajectory. The recent price drop should also be watched closely.
