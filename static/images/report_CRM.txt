*   **Analysis of Provided Table:**
    *   **CAGR:**  CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant variability. High growth in earlier periods (2015-2021) is followed by negative growth in recent periods (2020-2024). The most recent period (2023-2025) shows 0% growth.
    *   **MDD:**  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high across all periods, indicating significant risk and volatility in CRM's historical performance.
    *   **Alpha:**  Alpha has become increasingly negative in recent periods, indicating underperformance relative to a benchmark or market index. This is a major concern.
    *   **Beta:**  Beta values fluctuate. Negative betas in the most recent periods suggest that CRM has been moving in the opposite direction of the market, potentially offering some diversification benefits but also contributing to underperformance in a rising market.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has generally increased over time, peaking in 2022-2024 and then decreasing slightly.

    *   **Recent Relative Deviation Change:** A positive change indicates recent short-term improvement in relative performance.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. This suggests very poor long-term prospects relative to the S&P 500. The `{'price': 246.0, 'previousClose': 236.58, 'change': 3.98}` data showing a significant recent price jump should be noted as a potential short-term rebound but does not negate the overall negative outlook.
