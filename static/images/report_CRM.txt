## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.

The cumulative return of CRM is 151.44%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 118.37%.  The difference is 33.1%, placing it in the 43.9th percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500 based on the provided data (max: 130.8%, min: -43.3%). This indicates CRM has outperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period, but not exceptionally so compared to its historical performance relative to the index.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $324.56
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $321.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $331.34
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $327.91

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The 5-day moving average is even lower, further reinforcing this downward trend.  However, the recent price increase (Last-market data shows a positive change of $1.42) might indicate a slight upward correction.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 31.38 - This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -0.49 - A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 - Shows a recent short-term decline in relative strength.

The recent price increase is a slight upward movement; it's not significant enough to be called a sharp rebound.  Given the low RSI and negative PPO, the market sentiment appears bearish, despite this slight increase.  The expected return of 8.1% over the long term (2+ years) represents a potential outperformance relative to the S&P 500 for long-term investors.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

There's a duplicate entry for 2024-12-04.  Assuming this is an error, the data shows generally increasing revenue and EPS, though there's some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.  The recent quarters show a positive trend in both revenue and EPS.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) has demonstrated strong long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. However, recent short-term price action indicates a potential downturn.  While the recent earnings show increasing revenue and EPS, technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook. The high profit margins and relatively stable financial position are positive signs for long-term investors. The predicted long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500 remains a significant potential benefit.  However, the current oversold condition (low RSI) could represent a buying opportunity for investors with a longer-term perspective and a tolerance for risk.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price decline is warranted.
