**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistently positive alpha from 2017-2021, indicating CRM outperformed the market during those periods.  However,  the significantly negative CAGR and high MDD from 2020-2024 highlight substantial periods of underperformance. The high beta values (generally above 1) suggests CRM's returns are more volatile than the market.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) has shown periods of strong performance, but recently experienced significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While some technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, the negative expected return and high market risk warrant caution.  A thorough review of the -174.9% expected return calculation is crucial.  Long-term investment requires careful consideration of the company's growth prospects,  its high volatility (high Beta), and the current market conditions.  Further investigation into the discrepancies between historical alpha and recent underperformance is needed,  as is a comparison of financial metrics against industry benchmarks.
