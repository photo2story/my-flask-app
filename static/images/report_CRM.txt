*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.35
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.51
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Disparity Change:** -0.2 (Negative - Short-term Decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1694.6

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A low MRI suggests a relatively low-risk environment for the overall market.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 58.35 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO suggests a slight upward momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests a cautious approach, recommending buying a portion of cash reserves.
*   **Relative Disparity Change:** The negative change in relative disparity confirms a short-term underperformance compared to the reference index.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-1694.6%) is a major red flag. This indicates a significantly negative outlook for CRM's performance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon. This number is very high in magnitude and should be treated with caution.

Given the price change of 0.6 and a previous close of 250.76, the price movement can be viewed as a small uptick, but not necessarily a " 급반등 (sudden surge)". There is no indication of 급하락 (sudden drop) either.

### 7. 종합적으로 분석 (Overall Summary)

Salesforce (CRM) presents a mixed picture. While recent earnings and revenue data are positive, and analysts maintain a generally positive outlook, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Technical indicators offer a neutral to slightly bullish short-term view, but the extremely negative expected return is a major concern. The high Beta implies the stock is highly volatile relative to the market. The recent news indicates external factors, such as AI trends, could significantly influence the company's future.

**In conclusion:** Based on the provided data, while Salesforce shows some positive signs in terms of recent earnings and analyst ratings, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the high volatility, and the concerning expected return suggest caution. Further investigation is warranted to understand the factors driving the negative outlook and to assess the long-term investment potential of CRM.
