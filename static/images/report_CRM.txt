## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

* **Ticker:** CRM
* **Company:** Salesforce is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.
* **Cumulative Return (CRM):** 19.997%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 76.080%
* **Return Difference (CRM vs VOO):** -56.1%
* **Relative Divergence:** 16.1% (This indicates CRM's underperformance relative to VOO is in the 16.1st percentile of historical divergence, based on the minimum and maximum divergence observed in the past.)

**1. Performance Analysis (vs. S&P 500):**

Salesforce significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered, with a cumulative return of approximately 20% compared to the S&P 500's 76%.  The provided relative divergence metric suggests that this level of underperformance is relatively low compared to historical ranges but still represents a substantial difference.

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows a significant increase in Beta over time, indicating increasing market sensitivity.  While CAGR is generally positive, the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values highlight substantial risk involved in holding CRM during several periods. The extremely negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 clearly shows periods of substantial investor losses.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2018-2020  | 32.0% | 64.9% | 2.0% | 0.7 | 212.3 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $249.84
* **Previous Close:** $254.93
* **Change:** -$2.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $253.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $264.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $296.62

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price drop of $2.09 is a notable negative development.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 33.58 (Suggests oversold conditions, but needs further context.)
* **PPO:** 0.14 (Positive, but weak, suggesting a possible trend change.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (Stable, but in context of downtrend is not positive.)
* **Expected Return (Long Term):** -218.8% (This highly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 requires further explanation and context – a negative return of this magnitude over a 2+ year timeframe is highly unusual unless the data is not properly scaled or other serious issues exist)

The indicators point towards a bearish trend, although the oversold RSI suggests a potential rebound.  The extremely negative expected return is concerning and warrants investigation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue growth with some slight fluctuation but generally increasing EPS.  However, a more thorough analysis is needed to determine the trend and growth sustainability.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-12-04 | 1.6 | 9.44 B$ |
| 2024-08-29 | 1.48 | 9.32 B$ |
| 2024-05-30 | 1.58 | 9.13 B$ |
| 2023-11-30 | 1.26 | 8.72 B$ |
| 2024-12-04 | 1.26 | 8.72 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows consistent growth, while profit margins remain relatively high and stable.  ROE is modest and shows some fluctuation.  Overall, the financial health appears relatively solid, although further analysis is required to assess long-term prospects.


Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $9.99B | 77.81% |
| 2024-10-31 | $9.44B | 77.71% |
| 2024-07-31 | $9.32B | 76.85% |
| 2024-04-30 | $9.13B | 76.33% |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-01-31 | $61.17B | 2.79% |
| 2024-10-31 | $58.52B | 2.61% |
| 2024-07-31 | $57.63B | 2.48% |
| 2024-04-30 | $59.68B | 2.57% |
| 2024-01-31 | $59.65B | 2.42% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce's performance has been underwhelming compared to the S&P 500, particularly in recent years.  While the company shows strong revenue growth and healthy profit margins, the significant underperformance and high market sensitivity (Beta) are major concerns. The extremely negative long-term expected return requires clarification. The provided data suggests a potential for a short-term rebound due to oversold conditions (RSI), but a long-term investment decision requires a more comprehensive analysis, including a detailed examination of the -218.8% expected return figure, and consideration of the company's long-term growth prospects and competitive landscape.  Furthermore, investigation is needed to understand the unusually large maximum drawdowns observed.  The data provided is suggestive of volatility and potentially higher risk, which is confirmed by the high beta values.
