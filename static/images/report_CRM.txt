Over the analyzed period, CRM's cumulative return (158.66%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (52.12%).  The difference in cumulative returns is approximately 106.5%, placing it at the 62.9th percentile of its historical range (max 166.3%, min 5.2%).  This suggests strong outperformance relative to the market, although the relative performance has varied considerably over time.
