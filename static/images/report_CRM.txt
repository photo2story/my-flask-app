## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Salesforce Inc. (CRM), a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period.  The cumulative return for CRM is 160.32%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 115.09%. This represents a difference of 45.2 percentage points.  The relative outperformance, considering the historical range of the difference between CRM and VOO, places CRM at the 50.8th percentile, indicating a generally strong performance relative to its historical comparison to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows varying performance depending on the period considered.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been strong in most periods, the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights significant periods of risk. The consistently high beta suggests CRM's returns are highly correlated with the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $334.33
* **Last Market Price:** $330.07
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $338.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $347.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $321.46

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price is minimal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 37.47 – This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.94 – This indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -2.0 – This confirms the short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 6.3% – This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.  The provided data does not specify how the 6.3% figure was arrived at and context is needed.

The low RSI and negative PPO, combined with the negative relative divergence, all point to a bearish short-term outlook. However, the positive long-term expected return and the price being above the 60-day moving average could suggest buying opportunities for long-term investors.  The provided context for the expected return is needed to evaluate its reliability and basis.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Revenue and EPS show modest growth with some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation. While revenue generally increased, EPS saw some decrease in certain quarters.  A more comprehensive analysis requires data on earnings expectations to determine whether results were beats or misses.  The data provided does not offer sufficient information for analysis based on reported numbers and the request for analysis in relation to expected numbers.

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has shown consistent growth over the reported quarters. Profit margins remain relatively high and stable, though showing slight fluctuations quarter-to-quarter.  Equity has fluctuated, but generally shows positive trends. ROE (Return on Equity) is relatively low and shows some variability, and more comprehensive analysis requires additional financial and industry metrics.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions not provided in the data given.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce has shown significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, but recent short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The stock is currently trading below its short-term moving averages.  While long-term prospects appear positive based on the provided expected return (with the important caveat that the calculation method is not specified), investors should carefully consider the short-term bearish momentum and the relatively low ROE.  Further research into recent news, analyst opinions, and a more detailed analysis of the provided financial information is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  Additional data on earnings expectations and industry comparisons would enhance the robustness of any investment decision.
