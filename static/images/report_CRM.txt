CRM's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, lagging by 57.3 percentage points.  The relative divergence suggests that while underperforming, this is not an extreme outlier compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a high beta (mostly above 1) consistently throughout the years, indicating a higher sensitivity to market movements than the overall market.  Alpha fluctuates, suggesting periods of outperformance (positive alpha) and underperformance (negative alpha) relative to the market. Notably, the significant negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 highlights periods of substantial underperformance.  The recent positive CAGR and decreasing beta might signify an improvement in performance relative to the market, however it is still highly volatile.

Salesforce (CRM) has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, particularly during 2020-2023. While recent quarters show revenue growth and improving profit margins, the stock remains below its moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The high beta suggests substantial market sensitivity.  The -233.5% expected return is an outlier and needs clarification.  A more detailed analysis, including consideration of future growth prospects and macroeconomic factors, is needed to make a well-informed investment decision.  The relatively low ROE suggests areas for potential improvement in operational efficiency. The provided data suggests caution, especially considering the high volatility and recent underperformance.  Further investigation into the drivers of the inconsistent EPS growth and the extremely negative expected return is crucial.
