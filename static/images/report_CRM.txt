*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 260.78

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently slightly up from the previous close. The 5-day moving average is below the current price, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, the current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential resistance and a possible downtrend in the medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **RSI:** 39.26 (Approaching Oversold)

*   **Expected Return:** -3197.8%

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests low market risk. The RSI value is below 40 and approaching oversold conditions, which might signal a potential buying opportunity if the price stabilizes. The positive change in relative disparity over the last 20 days suggests recent short-term improvement relative to its benchmark. The Hybrid Signal recommends a cautious buy with 80% of cash, influenced by the MRI. However, the extremely negative expected return is concerning and suggests significant long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 if current trends continue. The slight positive change in price indicates a marginal rebound, but this could be temporary and requires monitoring given the broader negative outlook.
