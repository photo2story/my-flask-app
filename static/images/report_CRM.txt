| 2023-2025  | -1.0%  | 99.6%  | -40.0% | 2.4  | 233.8  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuating, with periods of strong growth followed by declines.  Recent years show negative or low growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Predominantly negative, suggesting underperformance relative to the market risk-adjusted return.
*   **Beta:**  Generally increasing over time, indicating CRM's stock price is becoming more sensitive to market movements. High Beta values indicates the stock is significantly more volatile than the market.
*   **Cap (Capitalization):**  Shows growth, although fluctuating, reflecting the company's overall size.

**2) Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 245.46
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 245.565, 'previousClose': 244.56, 'change': 0.41} (Price increased slightly from previous close).
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 245.75
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 247.78
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 253.38

**Analysis:**  The current price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), which is generally considered a bearish signal. The small change from the previous close and that the current price is below the moving averages indicates a short-term downward trend.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.434 (Medium Risk)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 40.13 (Approaching oversold territory but not yet there).
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.11
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 50% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.41) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-05)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 1.0 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3670.3% (Significant underperformance vs S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI indicates a medium level of market risk.
*   The RSI suggests the stock is approaching oversold conditions, potentially indicating a possible bounce.
*   The PPO is slightly positive.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a cautious approach, recommending only a partial investment.
*   The positive change in relative divergence suggests a recent improvement in CRM's performance compared to the S&P 500, but it is a very short-term signal.
*   The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.  It implies the model projects significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. The {'price': 245.565, 'previousClose': 244.56, 'change': 0.41} value is relatively small, so it might not have a significant impact.

*   **Number of Opinions:** 51
*   **Target Price (Avg/High/Low):** 334.87 / 430.00 / 221.00

**Analysis:**  Analysts generally have a positive outlook on CRM, with a consensus rating of "Buy" and an average target price significantly above the current price. However, there is a wide range in target prices, indicating uncertainty. The fact that the low target price is *below* the current price shows some analysts have a bearish outlook.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-09-04 | 1.97 | 10.24 B$    |

**Analysis:**  Both EPS and Revenue have generally been increasing, particularly in the most recent quarter (2025-09-04), suggesting positive growth trends. However, there appears to be a duplicate entry for 2025-09-04, which could be an error in the data.

**7) 종합 Analysis:**

**Summary:**

Salesforce (CRM) presents a mixed picture. While recent news and analyst opinions are generally positive, and the company demonstrates solid revenue growth, high profit margins, and increasing equity and ROE, there are significant concerns:

*   **Underperformance:** CRM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** Historical data shows high maximum drawdowns, indicating substantial price volatility.
*   **Negative Alpha:** CRM's historical performance suggests it hasn't delivered market-beating risk-adjusted returns.
*   **Concerning Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return suggests the model anticipates significant future underperformance relative to the market.
*   **Technical Signals:**  The current price is below key moving averages, and the Hybrid Signal recommends a cautious approach.

**Conclusion:**

While the positive analyst sentiment and improving financial performance are encouraging, the historical underperformance, volatility, and concerning expected return warrant caution.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before investing in CRM. It's recommended to investigate *why* the model projects such a negative expected return, as this is a critical point of concern. Also, compare this data with other sources before making investment decisions.
