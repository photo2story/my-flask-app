**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows fluctuating performance, with strong growth in earlier periods, but significant negative returns in the 2020-2024 period. The recent 2023-2025 period shows a modest recovery.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates substantial risk, with drawdowns consistently high, particularly in recent years.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, measuring performance above the benchmark, is largely negative in recent periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta, measuring volatility relative to the market, has increased in recent years, suggesting CRM's stock has become more volatile.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has generally increased over the period, but recent market corrections could affect this trend.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** 240.51
*   **Previous Close:** 240.88
*   **Change:** -0.15
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 246.07
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 258.46
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 266.94

**Analysis:** CRM's current price is below all its moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend. The small negative change from the previous close does not signal a major volatility event on its own.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 25.39 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.94
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_69%_Sell 69.2% of holdings (414 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** 0.0 (Negative Trend)
*   **Expected Return:** -4017.9%

**Analysis:** The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, which can sometimes suggest a potential for a rebound, but it's not a guarantee. The negative PPO and recent decline in relative deviation reinforce the downtrend. The Hybrid Signal suggests a very cautious approach, recommending a high cash position. The significantly negative Expected Return should be interpreted with extreme caution; such values are often the result of outliers or unusual market conditions and don't represent a realistic projection. The Market Risk Indicator suggests low risk environment which is a bit contraditory with other signals.
