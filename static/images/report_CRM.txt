The high and fluctuating Alpha values suggest periods of both significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. The Beta increased significantly in recent years, indicating higher market sensitivity.  The CAGR shows high growth in some periods but significant losses in others.  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights substantial risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $270.20
* **Last Market Price:** $271.31
* **5-day Moving Average:** $273.47
* **20-day Moving Average:** $279.35
* **60-day Moving Average:** $310.02

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent slight increase (0.41) is not sufficient to overcome the longer-term downtrend indicated by the moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.29 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.11 (Slightly positive, suggesting a potential bullish signal but weak)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -5.0% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** -48.2% (This is a very negative outlook, needs further clarification on its calculation and underlying assumptions.  Long-term underperformance against VOO is suggested).  The small recent price increase does not significantly alter this negative outlook.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) shows mixed signals. While revenue and profitability are strong and growing, the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500 is significantly weaker.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend, with the price below key moving averages and a low RSI. The negative expected return of -48.2%  is a very concerning projection.  The high and volatile Alpha and increasing Beta in recent years indicate significant risk and unpredictable performance. Further investigation into the -48.2% expected return calculation and the duplicate earnings data entry are crucial before forming a definitive investment opinion.  Long-term investment should consider the substantial risk indicated by the data.  This report strongly recommends further due diligence before investing in CRM.
