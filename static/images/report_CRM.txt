## Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Salesforce Inc. is a cloud-based software company providing customer relationship management (CRM) services.  The provided data shows a significant outperformance of CRM compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with a substantial cumulative return difference.  However, recent price action and indicators suggest potential caution.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **CRM Cumulative Return:** 151.69%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 121.84%
* **Return Difference:** 29.86%  (This signifies CRM's outperformance compared to the S&P 500 at the end of the period.  The provided range of historical divergence (-43.3% to 130.8%) puts this current divergence in the higher range.)

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows periods of significant outperformance (high Alpha values) alongside periods of underperformance, even negative returns. The Beta values suggest high volatility, fluctuating around market movements.  The substantial fluctuations in CAGR and MDD reflect significant market-related risks. The market cap (Cap(B)) consistently increased over the years despite the negative period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $326.54
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $326.82
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $336.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $337.26

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price drop of $1.00 ($329.85 to $326.54) further strengthens this bearish signal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.70 – This suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.50 – This negative value confirms the bearish trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7 – This reinforces the short-term bearish trend.

The -1.7 change in relative divergence and the negative PPO value support the negative price change observation. The relatively low RSI value might suggest an oversold condition, indicating potential for a price rebound. The expected return of 8.8% over the long term (2+ years) suggests outperformance compared to the S&P 500 but this must be evaluated cautiously considering past volatility and current indicators.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

CRM has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a significant cumulative return difference.  However, current technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) suggest a short-term bearish trend.  Despite recent price declines, strong financial fundamentals (high revenue, profit margins, and equity) remain.  The long-term outlook (8.8% expected return) appears promising,  but the high volatility (reflected in the Beta and MDD) necessitates careful consideration of risk.  Investors should monitor the price action closely and consider diversifying their portfolio to mitigate risk.  Further investigation into the causes of recent price movements would be beneficial.  The duplicate data entry should be clarified.
