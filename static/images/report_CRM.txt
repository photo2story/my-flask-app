**Overall Analysis:**

CRM has lagged behind the S&P 500 in terms of return but has recently shown signs of improvement. The stock is currently oversold based on RSI, but its price is trading above key moving averages, which could indicate a potential rebound. The recent earnings report was positive, suggesting that the company may be turning a corner. However, it's important to note that the expected return is based on historical data and is not a guarantee. 

**Recommendation:**

Given the recent positive earnings report and the stock's oversold condition, investors may consider adding CRM to their portfolio, but it's important to monitor the company's progress and evaluate potential risks.
