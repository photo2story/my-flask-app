* **20-Day Moving Average:** $334.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $299.52

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Expected Return (38.8%):** A projected 38.8% long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is indicated.  This should be considered with caution, as it's based on past performance and not a guaranteed future return.

EPS fluctuated slightly, with a notable dip from $1.58 in May 2024 to $1.26 in November 2024 and a slight rise again in Dec 2024.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce (CRM) demonstrates a history of strong performance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in terms of cumulative returns.  However, volatility is evident, highlighted by the substantial negative CAGR in 2020-2022. The current price sits above its moving averages, suggesting upward momentum, although RSI is nearing overbought territory, cautioning against further immediate upward movements.  Earnings data shows positive revenue and EPS trends, but lacks the context of analyst expectations to completely judge performance.  Further information is needed to comprehensively assess news, market outlook, and analyst opinions. The high beta value highlights the significant risk associated with this investment.  While the long-term expected return looks optimistic, investors should proceed with caution, considering the market volatility and inherent risk.
