*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is largely negative in recent periods, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark.  Positive alpha in earlier periods suggests previous outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values have increased significantly in recent years, suggesting the stock has become much more sensitive to market movements.  A beta > 1 implies higher volatility than the market.

*   **Previous Close:** \$262.28

**Analysis:**  The current price is slightly above the 5-day moving average but below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a short-term upward trend, but the price is still facing resistance from the longer-term moving averages. The small price change from the previous close indicates minimal movement.

*   **Expected Return (%):** -3485.4% (Highly negative - predicted underperformance vs. S&P 500 over the long term)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The low MRI suggests relatively low overall market risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is below 40, suggesting the stock may be approaching oversold conditions, potentially indicating a future price rebound.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is strongly suggesting to decrease holdings and increase cash reserves.
*   **Deviation Change:** The positive change in relative deviation over the past 20 days suggests a short-term improvement in performance relative to VOO, but this is occurring from a very low base.
*   **Expected Return:**  The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting very poor long-term prospects relative to the S&P 500 based on the model.
