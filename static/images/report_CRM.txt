**5. Financial Information:**

No 'Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit' data was available.  This significantly limits the financial analysis that can be performed.  More comprehensive financial data is crucial for a complete evaluation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Salesforce has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent data shows a bearish short-term trend. While the low RSI suggests potential for a rebound, the negative PPO and declining moving averages indicate caution.  The lack of comprehensive financial data limits a thorough assessment of its financial health.  The projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (8.6%) suggests potential for investors with a long-term horizon, but careful monitoring of market conditions and financial reports is advised.  The high volatility indicated by the beta values highlights the need for risk management.
