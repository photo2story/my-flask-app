* **Previous Close:** $255.23
* **5-day Moving Average:** $261.22
* **20-day Moving Average:** $274.68

* **RSI:** 20.08 (Oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.74 (Bearish signal)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.9 (Short-term upward momentum, but insignificant given the larger negative trends)
* **Expected Return:** -210.9% (This extremely negative figure requires further investigation and context. It's likely reflecting the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and should not be taken literally.)

The technical indicators strongly suggest bearish sentiment.  The extremely negative expected return warrants further investigation of the model used to arrive at this figure.  The significant price drop likely contributed to the oversold conditions.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Salesforce (CRM) shows a concerning trend of underperformance compared to the S&P 500, especially in recent years.  While revenue and profit margins are relatively stable, the negative alpha, high beta, and oversold technical indicators paint a bearish picture.  The extremely negative expected return requires clarification and should be treated with caution.  The data suggests potential challenges, and further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the methodology behind the -210.9% expected return is necessary before forming a definitive investment opinion.  Thorough due diligence, including analysis of the company's strategic direction and competitive landscape, is recommended.
