**Overall Conclusion:**

CRM presents a mixed picture. While the company shows strong financial performance, recent relative underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and high volatility are concerning.

The positive analyst sentiment and recent price momentum suggest potential for future growth, but investors should proceed with caution and carefully weigh the risks. A deep dive into the assumptions behind the "Expected Return" calculation is highly recommended.
