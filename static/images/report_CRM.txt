**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate shows a significant decline in recent years, with negative growth for the periods 2020-2022, 2021-2023, 2022-2024 and 2023-2025.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are largely negative in recent years, suggesting underperformance relative to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** The Beta fluctuates, indicating varying levels of correlation with the market. The recent Beta drop to -2.1 indicates an inverse correlation with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization initially increased, but has fluctuated in recent years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 234.93
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 235.24, Previous Close: 234.87, Change: 0.16
*   **5-day SMA:** 232.62
*   **20-day SMA:** 237.14
*   **60-day SMA:** 243.35

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the previous close. The 5-day SMA is below the current price, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the 20-day and 60-day SMAs are higher than the current price, indicating a potential downward trend in the medium and longer term.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.73
*   **PPO:** 0.01
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.5 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -4872.6

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, although the high value might be misleading due to the strong underperformance compared to the market. The RSI is close to the oversold territory (below 30 is oversold), which could indicate a potential buying opportunity. The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days suggests a recent short-term decline. Most importantly, the extremely negative expected return is a significant red flag.
