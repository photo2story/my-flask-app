**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | 17.0%  | 72.6%  | 9.0%     | 0.0  | 1.3    |
| 2018-2020  | -1619.0% | 75.8%  | -1643.0% | 0.0  | 2.6    |
| 2019-2021  | 207.0% | 82.5%  | 160.0%   | 0.0  | 7.4    |
| 2020-2022  | 157.0% | 82.5%  | 158.0%   | 0.0  | 5.4    |
| 2021-2023  | 205.0% | 82.5%  | 204.0%   | 0.0  | 10.6   |

| 2023-2025  | 222.0% | 81.6%  | 157.0%   | 0.1  | 27.5   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuates significantly. Very high positive growth in some periods, but a substantial loss in 2018-2020.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values across all periods indicate significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Generally positive, suggesting outperformance relative to a benchmark (likely risk-free rate). However, the extremely negative alpha in 2018-2020 is concerning.
*   **Beta:** Consistently very low (close to 0), implying a very weak correlation with the overall market (S&P 500). This is expected for a cryptocurrency, which often moves independently of traditional markets. However, there is a small increase in 2023-2025 (0.1) suggesting there is a slight increase in correlation with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Increasing over time. This could be related to an increase in market cap and the effect on Beta of an increase in market cap.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 0.2787
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 0.2901, Previous Close: 0.2856, Change: 1.56%
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.2802
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.2821
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.3004

**Analysis:**

*   The price is currently below the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.
*   The 1.56% increase in the last market period hints at a small recovery, but it needs to be sustained to reverse the short-term trend.

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 38.64 (approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.36
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3592 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90)" - Recommends buying due to oversold conditions and a high MRI score from the hybrid signal. Monthly investment recommended (1% of $1,000 = $10).
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** 0.1 (+), indicating a short-term upward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** 6268.8% (over 2 years, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.8 indicates a medium investment recommendation.
*   The RSI suggests the asset is nearing oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
*   The PPO is positive, suggesting bullish momentum, albeit modest.
*   The hybrid signal strongly suggests buying, citing oversold conditions and a high MRI within that specific signal's calculations.
*   The expected return is exceptionally high, implying significant potential upside if held long-term.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   *No analyst consensus or target information was provided.*

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Tron has demonstrated substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this outperformance comes with significant volatility and risk, as evidenced by the high MDD and fluctuating CAGR.

**Key Points:**

*   **High Growth, High Risk:**  Tron offers potential for high returns but also carries significant risk. The large maximum drawdowns indicate this.
*   **Low Market Correlation:** Tron's price action is largely independent of the broader stock market.
*   **Recent Short-Term Weakness:** The price is currently below its key moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend. The oversold RSI, however, signals a potential rebound.
*   **Hybrid Signal is Bullish:** The hybrid signal is strongly bullish
*   **News Context:** The "Professor Coin" article highlights the interconnectedness of the crypto market, suggesting that Bitcoin's performance could influence Tron. The AI research article is not directly relevant.
*   **Missing Information:** The lack of analyst consensus and price targets makes it difficult to assess the professional outlook for Tron.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the data, TRX-USD (Tron) appears to be a high-risk, high-reward investment. The technical indicators suggest a potential buying opportunity in the short term due to oversold conditions. However, the high volatility and dependence on the broader cryptocurrency market should be carefully considered.
