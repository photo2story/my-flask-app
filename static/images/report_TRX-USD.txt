**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha      | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|--------|------------|------|--------|

| 2019-2021  | 207.0%   | 82.5%  | 160.0%     | 0.0  | 7.1    |
| 2020-2022  | 157.0%   | 82.5%  | 158.0%     | 0.0  | 5.2    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows fluctuating performance with both very high growth and a significant decline in different periods. High historical returns may not be indicative of future results.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates substantial risk with drawdowns consistently above 70%. This highlights the potential for significant losses.
*   **Alpha:** Generally positive, implying outperformance relative to a benchmark (likely the market). However, the -1643% Alpha in 2018-2020 signals major underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Consistently near zero suggests that TRX's performance is largely independent of the overall market (S&P 500). This is typical for cryptocurrencies, as they are often driven by factors specific to the crypto market.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Cap in Billions):** Shows growth in market capitalization over time.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close Price:** 0.27899
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 0.279046, Previous Close: 0.27945364, Change: -0.15
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.2788
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.2807
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.2888

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA, and below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, which *could* suggest a short-term downward trend.
*   However, the differences between the SMAs are small, so the trend is not strongly indicated.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 40.28 (Below 50, leans towards oversold conditions.)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.121
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3592 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90)" - Suggests a strong buy signal based on the oversold condition, a boost to the MRI to 0.90, and a model recommending investing 100% of available cash.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.2 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 6529.0% - Significantly high, indicating substantial potential upside if invested long-term (over 2 years).

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI below 50 indicates the TRX has recently been trending down or is considered underbought.
*   The model-generated hybrid signal strongly suggests a *buy* due to what it interprets as oversold conditions. This is tempered by acknowledging the high expected return requires a long-term investment horizon.
*   High expected return should be viewed with skepticism given the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Performance:** TRX has delivered exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but with significantly higher volatility and risk, as shown by the high MDD.
*   **Technicals:**  Recent price action is slightly negative, while the RSI indicates oversold conditions. The hybrid model suggests a strong buy signal.
*   **News:**  Mixed, with a potential Nasdaq listing being a major catalyst. Company treasury additions and integration partnerships are also positive developments. A seeking alpha news article reports being overvalued.
*   **Risk:** High.  Cryptocurrencies are inherently speculative, and TRX has demonstrated significant price swings in the past.
*   **Recommendation (Cautious):**  The model is indicating a buy signal. The potential Nasdaq listing could provide further upside in the longer term. Due to its volatility, ensure thorough research, risk tolerance, and consider position sizing accordingly. Diversification is critical. Analyst consensus should be sought for more information.
