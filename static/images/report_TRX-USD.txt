**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows highly variable annual growth. The period of 2018-2020 shows a huge loss, while other periods show significant gains.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD values indicate significant potential losses during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently positive Alpha values (except for 2018-2020) suggest the investment has outperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis. However, the large negative alpha in 2018-2020 reflects a period of significant underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values near 0 indicate that the stock price is nearly independent of broader market movements (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has significantly increased, implying growth of the company.

*   **20-day SMA:** 0.2877
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.3103

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which *could* indicate a short-term downward trend. The price has decreased from 60-day to 5-day.
*   The 0.3% change in the last market suggests slight positive momentum.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 24.09 (Oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.3451

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (Decreasing)
*   **Expected Return:** 6209%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI below 30 indicates that the asset may be oversold, suggesting a potential buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO confirms the downward price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Despite the current price trend, the signal recommends buying. It is deemed 'Very Safe' because the MRI for that signal is 0.90.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** A negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days indicates a short-term downward trend in comparison to VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 6209% is extremely high and should be viewed with skepticism. These figures are theoretical and heavily dependent on the model used to calculate them.
