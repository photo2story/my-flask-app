**Alpha, Beta, and Risk Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2019-2021  | 207.0%  | 82.5% | 160.0%   | 0.0  | 7.1    |
| 2020-2022  | 157.0%  | 82.5% | 158.0%   | 0.0  | 5.2    |

| 2023-2025  | 223.0%  | 81.6% | 159.0%   | 0.1  | 26.4   |

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, and Risk:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows variable growth rates over different periods. The negative CAGR in 2018-2020 is a major outlier, indicating a period of significant decline. More recent years show strong positive growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD values indicate substantial risk and price volatility. Investors should be prepared for significant potential losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Generally very high positive alpha values suggest strong outperformance relative to a benchmark, but the negative alpha in 2018-2020 again stands out as a major period of underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta is very close to 0, suggesting very low correlation with the market (S&P 500). This implies that Tron's price movements are largely independent of broader market trends.
*   **Cap(B):** Cap shows strong growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 0.2790
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 0.2791, Previous Close: 0.2795, Change: -0.12%
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.2788
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.2807
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.2888

**Analysis of Price Fluctuations:**

*   The short-term moving averages (5-day and 20-day) are below the 60-day SMA, which *could* indicate a short-term downward trend or consolidation.
*   The recent slight price decrease (-0.12%) is relatively small.
*   Overall, recent price action appears relatively stable, but the moving averages suggest potential for further downward movement.

**3) Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 40.28 (approaching oversold conditions)
*   **PPO:** 0.121
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3592 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.2 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 6529.0%

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** A reading of 0.7 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 40.28 indicates that Tron is nearing oversold territory, *potentially* signaling a buying opportunity. However, it's not yet definitively oversold (typically below 30).
*   **PPO:** The PPO suggests that short-term price movements are currently stronger than long-term price movements.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests buying TRX, considering it to be currently a very safe position because of oversold conditions.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The positive change in relative divergence suggests a recent short-term upward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return (6529.0%) should be treated with caution. Such high projections are often based on optimistic assumptions and carry significant risk. It suggests a belief in substantial future growth potential.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

Tron (TRX-USD) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but this comes with high volatility and risk, as evidenced by the MDD values. Beta is near 0, indicating little correlation with the broader market. Recent price action shows some signs of short-term weakness. Technical indicators suggest that TRX might be nearing oversold conditions. News headlines are mixed, with some positive developments offset by concerns about valuation. The expected return is exceptionally high but should be viewed skeptically.

**Overall Assessment:**

Investing in Tron appears to be a high-risk, high-reward proposition. The potential for significant gains is present, but investors should be prepared for substantial price swings and potential losses. The lack of correlation with the S&P 500 means that TRX can provide diversification benefits, but it also means that it may not perform well during periods of broad market strength.

**Recommendations (Disclaimer: This is NOT financial advice):**

*   **Consider your risk tolerance:** Tron is not suitable for risk-averse investors.
*   **Do further research:** Due to the high risk, conduct your own due diligence and consider consulting with a financial advisor.
*   **Be cautious of overly optimistic projections:** The 6529.0% expected return should be treated with extreme skepticism.
*   **Monitor news and developments:** Keep a close eye on news and events related to Tron and the cryptocurrency market in general.
*   **Be prepared to manage risk:** Use strategies such as stop-loss orders to limit potential losses.
