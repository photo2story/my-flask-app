**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.  Over the observed period, AMZN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a 4.64% higher cumulative return. While the relative divergence of 12.2% suggests a relatively strong position compared to its historical performance against VOO, it's crucial to consider the context of this metric.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others show negative alpha, particularly in 2020-2023.  The beta fluctuates, but recent years show a beta greater than 1, indicating higher volatility than the market. This highlights the risk associated with AMZN, especially in certain economic conditions. The high CAGR in some years is offset by significant maximum drawdowns (MDD).

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 68.0% | 5.7% | 50.0% | 0.0 | 621.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The significantly lower 60-day moving average indicates a more substantial decline over the past two months. The recent price change of $0.2 is minimal and doesn't signify a significant upward or downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 42.71 is approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce. However, the relatively low PPO value indicates relatively weak bullish momentum. The negative recent relative divergence (-5.3%) points to a short-term bearish trend. The MRI of 0.4354 suggests a medium-risk level. The projected long-term expected return of 185.3% against the S&P 500 is very high and should be treated with caution, as it's a prediction, not a guarantee.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, but its performance has been volatile.  While recent technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term price bounce, the long-term outlook depends on various factors, including macroeconomic conditions, competitive pressures, and future earnings. The high projected long-term expected return should be viewed with skepticism.  A thorough due diligence process, including a review of the company's strategic direction and competitive landscape, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistent and sometimes conflicting data points provided necessitate further investigation and validation before drawing definitive conclusions.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data needs immediate clarification.
