This report analyzes AMZN's recent performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering price movements, financial indicators, and earnings data to assess its current status and potential future performance.  Key findings show AMZN slightly outperforming the S&P 500, but with recent price declines and mixed financial indicators.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta values show mixed performance. While Alpha is generally positive, suggesting outperformance over the benchmark, its variability across the years (especially the significantly negative returns from 2020-2023) highlights the risk and volatility associated with AMZN.  Beta, significantly above 1 in recent years, emphasizes AMZN's high sensitivity to market fluctuations compared to the S&P 500.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows a continuous growth until 2022-2024, implying significant market positioning. The high CAGR values before 2020-2022 also demonstrates its impressive historical growth and potential. However, the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures highlight substantial periods of significant price drops in recent years.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Amazon's performance shows a mixed picture. While it slightly outperformed the S&P 500 over the longer term analyzed, recent price movements indicate a downtrend.  Financial indicators are mixed, with a relatively healthy profit margin and growing equity, but also showing some concerns regarding market sensitivity (high beta) and potential for further price corrections (RSI, PPO). The extremely high expected return requires validation before consideration.  Careful monitoring of both the market and Amazon's financial reports is crucial for informed investment decisions.  A deep dive into the 355.7% expected return calculation is necessary to understand its assumptions and validity, as it is far higher than typical market expectations.
