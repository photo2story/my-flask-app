**Company Overview:** Amazon.com Inc is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 136.39%
* **Return Difference:** 492.48% 
* **Relative Divergence:** 72.18%

This data suggests that Amazon has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. However, it's crucial to consider that historical performance does not guarantee future results. The high relative divergence indicates that AMZN has outperformed the S&P 500 significantly compared to its past performance.

* **60-day Moving Average:** $180.61

The stock price is currently slightly below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages but above its 60-day moving average. This could indicate a short-term consolidation phase, but the stock remains within a generally bullish trend.

* **RSI:** 55.89
* **PPO:** -0.02

The RSI suggests that the stock is in a neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold. The negative PPO indicates a potential bearish trend, but its relatively small magnitude might not be significant. The negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence suggests a short-term decline in relative divergence, possibly a pullback after the recent strong performance. The expected return of 30.78% represents a potential long-term (2 years or more) outperformance compared to the S&P 500.
