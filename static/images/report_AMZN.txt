**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.  The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The final cumulative return difference between AMZN and VOO is 136.2 percentage points.  This places AMZN in the 57.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided data.  While this indicates strong relative performance, it's crucial to remember this is a snapshot in time and past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha values are consistently near zero, suggesting AMZN's returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta).  However, the Beta values are quite high, signifying significantly higher volatility than the market.  Note the significant negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023, highlighting periods of substantial underperformance.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth over the period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **5-day Moving Average:** $228.21
* **20-day Moving Average:** $216.68
* **60-day Moving Average:** $200.96

The price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  However, it sits above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend (though this is relative to the recent sharp decline).

* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -3.2%, indicating a recent weakening of relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 131.2% above S&P 500. This is a high expected return, and requires significant caution as it's highly dependent on future market conditions. The current price of $220.52 doesn't indicate any immediate drastic price changes (no significant 급반등 or 급하락).

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has shown significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 historically but exhibits high volatility (high Beta). Recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, while technical indicators present a mixed signal.  Earnings show some fluctuations but a general upward trend in both revenue and EPS.  The projected long-term return is high but should be treated with considerable skepticism, as it is highly dependent on future market conditions and does not reflect the risk inherent in such a prediction. Further research is needed, including an analysis of analyst opinions, market sentiment, and future projections, to form a complete investment thesis.  The lack of information on earnings expectations, news, and analyst opinions significantly limits the depth of this analysis.
