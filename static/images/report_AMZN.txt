**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Amazon (AMZN) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the unspecified period, exhibiting a cumulative return of 275.58% compared to VOO's 119.91%.  This results in a return difference of 155.7%, placing it at the 65.2nd percentile of its historical range (max difference: 241.0%, min difference: -4.3%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta) and significant alpha (outperformance) in some periods, particularly recently (2023-2025).  However, the periods 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 show extremely negative CAGR's (-91% and -86% respectively), highlighting significant volatility.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth throughout the period.  The high Beta values suggest significant market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $237.68
* **Last Market Price:** $237.88
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $236.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $228.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $219.31

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The small positive change from the previous close (+$0.08) indicates a modest increase.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 77.05 (Overbought territory) – Suggests the stock is potentially overvalued in the short term and prone to a correction.
* **PPO:** 0.32 – Positive value suggests a bullish momentum, although the magnitude is relatively moderate.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +2.7 – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.

The high RSI value coupled with a positive but moderate PPO and the relative strength change warrants caution. While the short term trend is positive, the overbought RSI suggests a potential pullback is likely.  The expected return of 39.6% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant projection and relies on the assumption of continued outperformance.

**6. Overall Summary:**

AMZN has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, though recent periods showed considerable volatility. While current short-term indicators show positive momentum, the overbought RSI suggests caution.  Long-term prospects seem positive based on the projected 39.6% outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, this projection should be viewed with caution given the significant volatility observed in the past and requires detailed analysis of the underlying assumptions and market conditions.  Further investigation is needed to address the duplicated data entry in the earnings report and to fully understand the drivers of the significant past volatility.  The strong revenue growth and relatively stable profit margins contribute to a positive long-term outlook, but investors should carefully monitor short-term market fluctuations and indicators to mitigate risk.
