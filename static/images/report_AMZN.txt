**6. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon has historically shown strong performance compared to the S&P 500, but recent years have seen significant volatility. While the long-term expected return is high, it's crucial to acknowledge the risks involved.  The current price is below its moving averages, RSI suggests oversold conditions, and the MRI indicates medium risk.  Fundamental analysis reveals a generally healthy financial position with growing revenue and equity, but earnings data requires clarification due to a duplicate entry.  A thorough review of the inconsistent Beta values and addressing the data inconsistencies are necessary for a complete and accurate analysis.  Further research into the company's future prospects and the overall market environment is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high projected return should be viewed with caution, as it is a prediction and not a guarantee.
