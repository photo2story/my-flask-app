## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 245.98%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.20%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 133.8%.  The relative divergence of 56.3% indicates that AMZN's performance has been substantially above the S&P 500 historically,  falling within the upper 56.3% of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided min/max range.  However, it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant volatility, with periods of high growth followed by sharp declines.  The high beta values (mostly above 1) suggest AMZN's price is more volatile than the overall market.  The Alpha values are consistently near zero, indicating the return is largely in line with market risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $218.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $222.996
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $225.015
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $209.6427

The stock price is currently below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it's above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 47.75 – This indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral trend.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.6555 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** -0.2 – This confirms recent short-term downward price movement.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 53.0% – This suggests significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, assuming current trends continue.  This is a projection, and the actual return may vary significantly.

Given the closing price of $218.94, and its position below the short-term moving averages coupled with a negative PPO, there's currently no evidence of a significant recent price jump (or sharp rebound). There is however, evidence of a recent price decline.
