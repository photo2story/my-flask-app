## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Amazon (AMZN) is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.  The cumulative return of AMZN is 270.26%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.78%. The difference in cumulative return is 148.5%, placing it at the 62.2nd percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max divergence).  This indicates AMZN's strong outperformance relative to the broader market over the measured period, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows inconsistent performance, with periods of high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) alternating with significant negative returns.  The beta consistently shows high volatility (around 0.0), suggesting high sensitivity to market fluctuations, negating the expected relationship between alpha and beta (normally, a higher beta implies a positive alpha).  The massive swings in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlight the inherent risk in investing in AMZN.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $232.93
* **5-day Moving Average:** $228.93
* **20-day Moving Average:** $214.41
* **60-day Moving Average:** $199.90

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 84.75 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.

* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.1 – This shows a recent short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 119.8% – This represents a substantial expected outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, assuming current trends continue.  However, this is a forecast and not guaranteed. The high current price of $232.93 might be considered a point of potential risk, with the possibility of a short-term correction or consolidation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **No recent news provided:** The prompt does not include any recent news items, earnings announcements, market outlook information or analyst opinions. This section requires supplemental information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.  However, its high volatility and recent RSI indicate potential short-term risks.  Long-term projections are positive, with a significant expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500, provided the current trends continue.   Strong revenue and earnings growth is observed, indicating a healthy financial outlook.  The lack of recent news prevents a complete assessment of current market sentiment and potential risks.  Further research, particularly regarding recent news and analyst opinions, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  It's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and high growth stocks such as AMZN carry significant inherent risk.
