The cumulative return of AMZN is 292.12%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.31%.  The difference is 163.8%, placing it at the 51.1 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data's range of maximum and minimum differences.  This indicates AMZN's outperformance is notable but not exceptionally extreme within the context of its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha and beta values show varying levels of outperformance (alpha) and market sensitivity (beta) across different time periods.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $200.89
* **20-day Moving Average:** $201.93
* **60-day Moving Average:** $191.05

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential minor short-term bearish trend.  However, it's above the 5-day and significantly above the 60-day moving average, hinting at a longer-term bullish trend. The gap between the last market price ($207.28) and the closing price indicates a minor recent price dip.

**3. Technical Indicators and Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI:** 52.02 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)

* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 233.1% (Long-term, 2+ years, exceeding S&P 500)

The relatively low PPO value contrasts with the positive relative divergence, indicating potential conflicting signals.  The RSI is neutral. The significant expected return is a key positive factor. The last market price of $207.28 being higher than the closing price suggests a recent slight pullback, not a dramatic drop.
