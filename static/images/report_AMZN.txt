## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 248.74%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 115.09%.  The difference is 133.6%, placing it at the 56.2nd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates AMZN has substantially outperformed the market benchmark over the measured period, but the relative performance has fluctuated significantly based on the provided historical data (max 241.0% outperformance, min -4.3% underperformance).

The Alpha consistently shows near-zero values, suggesting that the outperformance is primarily driven by market-wide factors (as indicated by the Beta values above 1, especially in some periods). The Beta fluctuates, reflecting changes in the stock's sensitivity to overall market movements.  High Beta values suggest greater market risk correlation. Note that the negative CAGR and large MDD values in 2020-2023 highlight substantial risk during that period.

* **Last Market Price:** $219.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $224.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $224.77

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The price is also above its 60-day moving average, implying some longer-term support.  The recent market price of $219.86 does not indicate a significant or sudden price movement (neither 급반등 nor 급하락).

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.59  (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.78 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.3% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 53.5% (This is a projected excess return compared to the S&P 500 over a period of 2+ years.  The validity of this projection depends on the underlying model and assumptions.)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and Revenue for Amazon, although recent quarters have witnessed a slight downturn from the high of Q4 2023.  The trend is not as consistent as the Revenue, and the small decrease in EPS can be interpreted in different ways, which need further investigation and market context to evaluate.  There is no information provided about whether these figures met or exceeded expectations, which would be needed for a full analysis.
