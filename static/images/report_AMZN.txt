* **Closing Price:** $226.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $221.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $209.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $196.48

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 76.81 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction.
* **PPO:** 0.83 – A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +9.8 – This positive change in relative strength suggests a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 126.6% –  This represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500, assuming a continued upward trajectory.  However, the high RSI value should be considered in this projection.  The 226.09 price is above the moving averages implying recent positive momentum.  This could be the cause of the large expected return but a correction is likely.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a generally upward trend in both EPS and revenue, though there is a slight dip in the most recent quarter (2024-08-02 to 2024-11-01).  There are inconsistencies in the data showing the same EPS and revenue reported in October 2023 and November 2024 which requires clarification.   Without knowing the expected values, it's impossible to definitively label any quarter as a "beat" or "miss."  A more complete dataset with expectations is needed for a comprehensive earnings analysis.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Shows a general upward trend, with some quarterly fluctuations.
* **Profit Margin:**  Fluctuates around 17-19%, indicating relatively consistent profitability. A dip is seen in the last quarter of 2023 followed by an increase in the first two quarters of 2024 before dropping again.
* **Equity:** Steadily increasing, reflecting growth in the company's net worth.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** Varies, but generally remains above 5%, suggesting efficient use of shareholder equity.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent issues have been provided in the prompt.  Information on recent earnings announcements, market outlook, and analyst opinions is missing, limiting a full analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon (AMZN) demonstrates strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent price action suggests short-term bullish momentum, although the high RSI indicates potential overbought conditions and a possible correction.  The financial data shows a generally healthy and growing company with consistent profitability, but the provided earnings data is incomplete.  The lack of current news and analyst opinions prevents a more complete assessment of current market sentiment and future prospects.  Long-term prospects appear positive based on the provided expected return, but this needs to be viewed in context of the high RSI and the potential for a correction given the current overbought position.  Further data regarding recent news, analyst opinions, and complete earnings data (including expected values) would significantly improve the accuracy and completeness of this analysis.
