2025-04-23 - Analysis Report
## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**0) Overview:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.


**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon's cumulative return (74.14%) slightly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (76.31%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -2.17%, placing it at the 6.7th percentile of the historical range (-14.4% to 168.8%).  This suggests that while Amazon underperformed slightly compared to the broader market in this specific period, its relative performance is not exceptionally poor considering its historical volatility.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different periods.  While Beta generally reflects market sensitivity (a beta above 1 indicates higher volatility than the market), the fluctuating alpha (a measure of excess return compared to the market) suggests that Amazon's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been inconsistent.  High CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values are observed in some periods, offset by significant negative returns in others, particularly in 2020-2023.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values highlight the substantial risk associated with AMZN. The increasing Beta over time indicates increasing market sensitivity.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 64.0% | 58.6% | 32.0% | 0.0 | 640.2 |
| 2016-2018  | 70.0% | 67.8% | 49.0% | -0.0 | 822.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 60.0% | 67.8% | 27.0% | 0.4 | 1011.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 70.0% | 67.8% | 40.0% | 0.3 | 1782.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 55.0% | 62.6% | -5.0% | 0.3 | 1825.2 |
| 2020-2022  | -69.0% | 71.8% | -78.0% | 0.4 | 919.6 |
| 2021-2023  | -89.0% | 71.8% | -109.0% | 0.9 | 1663.4 |
| 2022-2024  | -33.0% | 71.8% | -53.0% | 1.0 | 2401.9 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $173.18
* **5-day Moving Average:** $173.41
* **20-day Moving Average:** $184.05
* **60-day Moving Average:** $205.54

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase (+$3.50) from the previous close shows a significant upward movement, possibly indicating a short-term reversal.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.01 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.31 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.9% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 436.5% (This exceptionally high figure requires further clarification on its calculation and assumptions, especially given the recent underperformance).  A 436.5% return over a two-year timeframe would be extraordinary and likely unrealistic without significant context.

The recent price increase of $3.50 from the previous close suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the overall technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.

Earnings are growing but at a decelerating rate.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Amazon's performance has been mixed. While it shows periods of strong growth and profitability, it also exhibits significant volatility and periods of underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The recent price action shows a potential short-term bounce, but technical indicators suggest caution. The extremely high projected return (436.5%) requires further investigation and justification.  A thorough analysis needs to account for the company's long-term growth prospects, macroeconomic conditions, and competitive landscape before forming a strong investment thesis. The reported financial data reveals positive growth but highlights potential concerns about margin sustainability and variability in return on equity.  More detailed analysis including a deeper look into debt levels, cash flows and future growth projections is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation.
