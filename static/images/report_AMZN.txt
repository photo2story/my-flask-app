**7. Overall Summary**

Recent news presents a mixed picture, with an FTC fine offsetting positive earnings and growth outlook. Analyst sentiment remains strongly positive. Fundamentally, Amazon shows strong revenue and equity growth.

**Investment Recommendation (Cautious):**

The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, but the recent underperformance, negative news, and technical indicators warrant caution. The long-term expected return is extremely high. A potential strategy would be to consider accumulating shares gradually, especially if the price declines further into oversold territory. It is important to monitor news regarding the FTC fine and its potential impact.
