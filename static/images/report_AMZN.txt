## Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 138.7%, placing it in the 58.3rd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates AMZN has substantially outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, but this is subject to the limitations of the historical data provided.  The high relative divergence suggests a significant outperformance.  Note that Alpha consistently shows as 0.0 in the provided data, suggesting that the model used might not capture all factors influencing the performance difference.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $225.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $221.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $222.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $212.41

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, but below the 60 day moving average showing some potential short term momentum. The price increased by $2.39 compared to the previous day's close.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 48.59 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.2988 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum. This is counter to the recent price action.  Further investigation into the PPO's calculation period is needed to reconcile this divergence.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.0 (20-day), indicating a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 49.5% (long-term, >2 years) – This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500. The high expected return should be viewed cautiously.  A 49.5% excess return is extraordinarily high and unlikely unless there are significant unseen factors at play.

The significant one-day price increase of $2.39 may indicate a short-term price fluctuation, possibly triggered by news or market sentiment, warranting closer inspection.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a general upward trend in both EPS and revenue, although there is some minor fluctuation between quarters. While the latest quarter (2024-11-01) shows a higher EPS than previous quarters, there's a possible data duplication for this date.  This requires clarification to ensure data accuracy.  The Revenue numbers show consistent growth apart from a slight dip in Q3 2023.  Further analysis and confirmation of the duplicate data point are needed for a definitive conclusion.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has seen some fluctuation but generally increased from Q3 2023 to Q3 2024. Profit margins remain relatively consistent, hovering around the 19% range in recent quarters except for Q4 2023.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows a steady increase.  ROE has fluctuated but generally stayed positive over the given timeframe.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the provided period, evidenced by the large cumulative return difference and high relative divergence.  However, conflicting signals from the PPO and current RSI, coupled with the exceptionally high projected excess return, warrant caution.  The recent upward price movement suggests some short-term bullish momentum, but the long-term outlook hinges heavily on the accuracy of the 49.5% excess return projection, which seems overly optimistic without further justification or context.  Further investigation is required regarding data inconsistencies (duplicate date in earnings data) and understanding the methodology behind the high expected return to provide a more reliable assessment.  Fundamental analysis suggests generally positive performance, but technical indicators and the projected return raise some concerns that need further clarification.
