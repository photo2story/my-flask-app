**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Growth:** Amazon demonstrates consistent revenue and equity growth, underpinned by solid profit margins.
*   **Analyst Confidence:** High analyst target prices suggest potential for significant upside.
*   **Technical Signals:** Current price action and technical indicators suggest a short-term buying opportunity, but the recent relative deviation indicates caution.
*   **Long-Term Potential:** The extraordinarily high expected return suggests significant potential for long-term outperformance against the S&P 500, but this should be viewed with caution, as such high expectations may not materialize.
*   **Risk:** While the MRI indicates low market risk, the historical volatility (high MDD) remains a concern.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the comprehensive data, a cautious buying approach may be warranted. Consider the potential for long-term growth and analyst confidence, but be aware of the recent underperformance and potential for volatility. The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a buying opportunity, but the "Caution" flag is appropriate.
