**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has shown a remarkable long-term growth trajectory, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, its high volatility, as evidenced by substantial MDDs, is a crucial risk factor.  While recent indicators suggest positive short-term momentum, the RSI suggests caution against overbought conditions. The projected long-term expected return is substantial, but this high return comes with inherent risks.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in AMZN.  The inconsistent earnings data needs further clarification.  A thorough due diligence process, considering factors beyond this report, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
