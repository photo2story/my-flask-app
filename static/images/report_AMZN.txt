## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Summary and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 257.04% for AMZN versus 118.37% for VOO. This represents a difference of 138.7%, placing it in the 58.3rd percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While the relative outperformance is substantial, the relative percentile ranking suggests this level of outperformance has occurred before within the historical dataset.

The provided Alpha values are all 0.0, indicating that the model used for the analysis did not detect any excess returns relative to the market benchmark (S&P 500) after accounting for risk. However,  the high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values in some periods, despite the negative CAGR in recent years, strongly suggest significant periods of market-beating returns. The high Beta values (around 1) indicate high sensitivity to market movements, reflecting the inherent volatility of the tech sector.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $225.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $221.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $222.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $212.41

The recent price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.  However, it is only slightly above the 20-day MA, signaling potential for consolidation or a pullback. The price is significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The price increase from the previous close reflects a positive day-to-day change.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 48.59 –  Near the neutral level (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.29 – Negative value indicates bearish momentum, aligning with the recent negative CAGR reported.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 2.0 (+) – This suggests short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 49.5% – This is a long-term (2+ years) expected excess return over the S&P 500. This figure should be treated with caution, as future performance is inherently uncertain.  The sharp recent price moves noted previously make forecasting a challenge.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a general upward trend in both EPS and Revenue, though with some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.  The data also appears to have a duplicated entry for 2024-11-01.  Consistency checks and data verification are needed to ensure data accuracy before a full analysis can be made.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows growth and fluctuations but consistent high overall profit margins (17-19%).  The data suggests a recent increase in profitability.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is increasing and Return on Equity (ROE) is relatively stable, although it shows some fluctuation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has shown significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 historically, but recent performance has been less impressive and more volatile.  While the long-term expected return is positive, the considerable price volatility and mixed short-term indicators warrant caution. The company shows strong revenue and profitability, suggesting long-term potential. However, investors should consider the inherent risks associated with technology stocks and the possibility of market corrections impacting AMZN disproportionately due to its high beta.  Further due diligence, including a thorough review of AMZN's financial statements and competitive landscape, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The conflicting signals between historical performance, recent price movement, and earnings data should be carefully considered.
