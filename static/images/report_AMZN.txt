**6) Overall Conclusion:**

AMZN has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over extended periods.

While current short-term indicators suggest a slightly bearish outlook, the long-term expected return remains high.  Further investigation is needed to resolve data inconsistencies in the earnings data.  A thorough risk assessment is crucial, given the company's historical volatility.  The strong financial performance and growth projections suggest a potentially rewarding investment for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance, but careful monitoring of market conditions and the company's performance is recommended.
