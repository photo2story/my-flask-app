**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 313.02%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 129.75%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 183.3%, placing it at the 57.1st percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided data).  This indicates AMZN has substantially outperformed the market over the measured period.  However, the provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and significant negative returns in some periods, highlighting the risk associated with this outperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $213.44
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $209.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $206.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $193.91

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.67 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.10 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (-) indicating recent short-term decline.  This needs further clarification as "nan" usually signifies missing data.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 211.2%  This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term. However, this figure requires further context (e.g., methodology) for accurate interpretation.  The fact that the last reported Relative Divergence is negative suggests caution.  A sharp upturn (213.41 significantly higher than previous) might indicate a rapid rebound; however, this needs additional supporting data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon's long-term performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrated by a substantially higher cumulative return.  However, this has been volatile, with periods of significant negative returns. Recent price movements suggest a positive trend, supported by positive PPO and a slightly above-neutral RSI.  The financial statements display generally positive trends in revenue, EPS and equity, although some figures require clarification (duplicate EPS report and missing Relative Divergence).  More recent news, analyst opinions and a more detailed explanation of the projected 211.2% expected return are necessary for a more complete assessment.  The missing data points and inconsistencies require further investigation before drawing definitive conclusions.
