**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $202.88
* Last Market Price: $198.18
* 5-Day Moving Average: $204.66
* 20-Day Moving Average: $200.21
* 60-Day Moving Average: $189.79

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term bearish momentum. However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing and last market price suggests limited recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 64.86 (Approaching overbought territory but not yet significantly so)
* PPO: -0.27 (Slightly negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* 20-Day Relative Strength Divergence: +8.99 (Short-term upward momentum)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI is relatively high, the PPO is negative. The positive divergence suggests a potential bullish reversal. Since the last market price ($198.18) is not significantly different from the closing price, there is no evidence of a dramatic price swing (sudden jump or drop).

* **Expected Return:** 18.93%  This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-11-01 | 1.46     | 158.88       |
| 2024-08-02 | 1.29     | 147.98       |

| 2024-11-01 | 0.96     | 143.08       |

There's a discrepancy in the table with two entries for 2024-11-01.  Assuming the later entry is a duplicate,  revenue and EPS are showing a generally upward trend.  Analysis requires comparing these figures to analyst expectations for the most recent quarter (2024-11-01) to determine if the results beat or missed projections.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon shows a strong long-term growth trajectory, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over extended periods. However, recent performance has been more volatile, highlighting the cyclical nature of the tech sector and the need to consider potential short-term market fluctuations. While the long-term outlook remains positive,  investors should carefully consider recent financial performance relative to expectations, technical indicators, and the current market sentiment before making investment decisions.  The relatively high expected return suggests significant upside potential, but this is contingent on the company's ability to maintain or exceed its growth projections.  Further research into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial to refine the assessment.
