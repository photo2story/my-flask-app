**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return for AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 143.9 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 60.4% indicates AMZN's performance has been substantially better than the S&P 500 over the period considered, placing it in the upper 60th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this high relative divergence needs to be analyzed in the context of the provided CAGR and MDD data (see section 4).

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively large gap between the closing price and the 60-day moving average further supports this.

* **Expected Return:** 122.1% – This is the projected long-term (2+ years) excess return compared to the S&P 500, assuming a continued outperformance.  This figure needs to be viewed cautiously, as it likely depends on numerous assumptions which are not explicitly stated in the information provided.  A high expected return is coupled with a high RSI suggesting potential risk of downward correction.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, as evidenced by its significantly higher cumulative return and relative divergence.  Recent price action suggests an upward trend, supported by moving averages. However, the high RSI indicates the stock is overbought, suggesting a potential correction is possible. Positive PPO and the rising 20-day relative divergence indicate continued short-term momentum.  Earnings data shows mixed signals with strong Q4 2024 results, but generally stable growth in EPS, alongside  some fluctuations in revenue and profit margin.  Further analysis requires more detailed information, including context on the expected returns, and current market sentiment.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits the overall assessment.  The high expected return should be viewed with caution, given the high RSI level.
