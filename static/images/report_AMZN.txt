### 7. Summary & Conclusion

AMZN presents a mixed picture.  While recent performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 and there are concerning news items (UK store closures), several factors suggest potential for future upside:

*   **Strong Analyst Consensus:** Indicates belief in the company's long-term prospects.
*   **Oversold Condition (RSI):**  Could signal a short-term buying opportunity.
*   **Positive Earnings and Revenue Trend:**  Suggests underlying business strength.
*   **High MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests a high level of investment suitability, seemingly at odds with the underperformance
*   **High Expected Return:** Long-term, 적립식 투자한다면 S&P500 대비 초과 수익을 기대할 수 있음
*   **Increased recent beta:**  최근 들어 베타 계수가 높아진 것은 S&P500 의 변동에 따라 민감하게 변할 수 있다는 것을 의미

**However, the high volatility (MDD), underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and increasing beta should be carefully considered.** The closure of UK stores and negative alpha trend are potential warning signs. An investment in AMZN at this point appears to be a higher-risk, potentially high-reward opportunity.
