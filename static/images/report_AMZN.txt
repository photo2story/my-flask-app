Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

AMZN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return more than double that of VOO.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $225.70

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price drop (-$0.595 or -0.3%) is relatively small and does not indicate a significant, immediate event of sharp decline.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-3.6):** Shows a recent decrease in relative performance to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (73.5%):**  This suggests a strong potential for outperformance against the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming current trends continue.  However, this is a forecast, and actual returns may vary significantly.

The projected high expected return, combined with oversold conditions, may present an attractive investment opportunity for long-term investors with a high-risk tolerance. However, it is crucial to carefully consider the current bearish signals and potential risks before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry is also recommended.  The data suggests a strong long-term potential but requires further analysis and confirmation of the provided data.
