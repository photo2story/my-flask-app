2024-12-20 - Analysis Report
## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Investment Report

**1. Performance Summary and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The final cumulative return difference between AMZN and VOO is 140.7 percentage points.  While the relative divergence indicator (59.1%) suggests AMZN's performance is above the median compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, it's crucial to remember this is not a prediction of future outperformance.  The provided alpha consistently shows near zero, suggesting that AMZN's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta).  However, the large swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlight considerable volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $223.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $227.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $217.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $201.47

The price is currently below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downward trend, but above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 65.46  - Suggests the stock is in moderately overbought territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.21 - Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -0.9 - Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 127.4% - This represents a significant projected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon, but this should be treated with caution as it is a forward-looking estimate and subject to significant uncertainty. The current price ($223.29) is not exceptionally high relative to recent trends, so a sudden, sharp movement isn't indicated by this data alone.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a general upward trend in both revenue and EPS over the past four quarters, though there's a slight dip in Q3 2024.  Specific growth rates aren't calculable without having figures for prior years.  It's noteworthy that revenue figures show consistent growth, except for a slight decrease in the latest quarter compared to the previous one, indicating slight slowdown in the growth rate. The EPS also shows some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.  Missing expected values prevents assessment of "beats" or "misses."

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue growth shows consistent growth, although the latest quarter shows a slight decline compared to Q2 2024, indicating a slowdown in growth momentum.  Profit margins have shown some variability, hovering around 17-19%.   Equity and ROE (Return on Equity) are increasing, generally indicating improved financial health. However, more historical data is needed for a more thorough evaluation of long-term trends.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News:**  Information about recent earnings news within the last two days is missing.
* **Market Outlook and Analyst Opinions:**  This information is absent from the provided data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon exhibits a strong long-term growth trend but with notable short-term volatility.  The significantly higher cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500 are promising but need further context considering the considerable drawdowns observed in some periods.  While technical indicators suggest some caution (overbought RSI, negative PPO), the long-term expected return and growing revenue and equity are positive signs. The recent earnings report shows a slight dip in revenue and EPS in the latest quarter compared to the prior quarter, suggesting a potential slight slowdown in the growth momentum.  However, a comprehensive analysis requires access to more information, including analyst opinions, competitor analysis, and detailed earnings expectations. The lack of recent news and market outlook significantly limits the scope of this report.  The projected long-term return should be viewed as an estimate and not a guaranteed outcome.  Further research is necessary before making any investment decisions.
