2025-01-18 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Amazon (AMZN) based on the provided data, presented in a report format.

**Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Performance Review**

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns is 138.7%, placing AMZN at the 58.3rd percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  While this shows substantial outperformance, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The high relative performance could be due to various market factors and doesn't guarantee continued outperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $225.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $221.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $222.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $212.41

The current price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent upward momentum.  However, it's still relatively close to these averages, indicating a period of consolidation rather than a strong breakout. The 60-day moving average is significantly lower, reflecting a more substantial upward trend over the longer term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 48.59
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.29
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** +2.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, >2 years):** 49.5% above the S&P 500

The RSI is near the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.  The negative PPO value indicates that the price momentum is weakening, however the positive relative divergence suggests short-term upward pressure.  The expected return of 49.5% over the S&P 500 is a significant projection and should be treated with caution; it's based on historical data and doesn't guarantee future performance.  The current price of $225.94 doesn't necessarily indicate a significant event (like a rapid surge or drop) based on the provided data alone; further context is needed to determine if this price is unusually high or low compared to its typical trading range.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue          |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| 2024-11-01 | $1.46  | $158.88 Billion |
| 2024-08-02 | $1.29  | $147.98 Billion |
| 2024-05-01 | $1.00  | $143.31 Billion |
| 2024-02-28 | $0.96  | $143.08 Billion | *(Note: There appears to be duplicate data for 2024-11-01 and 2024-02-28)*


Earnings per share (EPS) have shown a consistent upward trend in recent quarters, while revenue also demonstrates growth although a slight dip is visible from the Q4 2023 to Q1 2024.  The repeated entry for 2024-11-01 and 2024-02-28 needs clarification to ensure accuracy.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-Q3  | $158.88B     | 19.51%        |
| 2024-Q2  | $147.98B     | 19.14%        |
| 2024-Q1  | $143.31B     | 19.50%        |
| 2023-Q4  | $169.96B     | 17.22%        |
| 2023-Q3  | $143.08B     | 17.15%        |

Revenue has fluctuated, and profit margins have shown a recent increase, potentially indicating improved operational efficiency.  The data shows some seasonality, with higher revenue in Q4 2023 compared to subsequent quarters.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity       | ROE   |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| 2024-Q3  | $259.15B     | 5.91% |
| 2024-Q2  | $236.45B     | 5.70% |
| 2024-Q1  | $216.66B     | 4.81% |
| 2023-Q4  | $201.88B     | 5.26% |
| 2023-Q3  | $182.97B     | 5.40% |

Equity and Return on Equity (ROE) are both showing increases; this indicates that the companyâ€™s profitability is increasing relative to its equity investment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon's long-term performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500.  Recent earnings show growth in EPS and revenue, and improved profit margins.  However, the technical indicators present a mixed signal, with the price near a consolidation phase and momentum indicators slightly negative.  The high expected long-term return should be viewed cautiously due to inherent market volatility and unpredictable future performance.  The provided data suggests a potentially strong underlying business but requires further due diligence before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate data entry needs clarification for accurate financial statement analysis.
