**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a thorough financial analysis.  This is a significant gap in the provided information.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, although the relative divergence suggests this underperformance is not exceptionally unusual in historical context.  Recent price action shows a bearish trend. Technical indicators offer a mixed signal, while the extraordinarily high projected long-term expected return needs further clarification.  The absence of key financial data like total revenue and gross profit severely limits a comprehensive assessment of the company's financial health.  A thorough analysis requires complete and reliable financial statements.  The highly volatile earnings performance and lack of crucial financial data make a definitive conclusion difficult.  Further investigation is needed.
