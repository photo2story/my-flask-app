The provided alpha and beta analysis shows high alpha values (consistently above 1) in most periods, indicating significant outperformance compared to the market benchmark.  However, beta values are also generally above 1 signifying higher than average volatility. The recent negative CAGR reflects market headwinds experienced in recent years.
