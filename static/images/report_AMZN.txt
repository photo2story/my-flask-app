Okay, here's an analysis of Amazon (AMZN) based on the provided data, presented in a structured report format:

## Amazon (AMZN) Stock Analysis - September 9, 2025

**Company Overview:** Amazon.com Inc is a global technology company involved in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

### 1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **AMZN Cumulative Return:** 97.37%

*   **Range:** Max: 182.3, Min: -9.2

| 2023-2025  | 17.0%   | 73.0%   | -36.0%   | 1.0    | 2515.2 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows strong historical growth until recent periods (2020-2025), where performance has significantly declined.  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a positive CAGR again, but it's substantially lower than historical averages.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD values (especially in recent years) indicate significant price volatility and risk.  The MDD has remained high, exceeding 70%, highlighting potential price drops from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:**  Represents the excess return compared to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500).  Negative alpha values in recent periods (2020-2025) indicate underperformance relative to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. Beta values near 1 suggest AMZN's price movements are strongly correlated with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization in Billions. Shows the growth in Amazon's size over time.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movements

*   **Current Price:** 232.33
*   **Last Market Close:** Price: 235.84, Previous Close: 232.33, Change: 1.51
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 229.78
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 227.62
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 223.35

**Analysis:** The stock price closed higher in the last trading session (increase of 1.51) and is trading above all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This *suggests* a short-term bullish trend. The increasing last market price shows immediate positive market sentiment.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 51.62 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.1569 (Slightly Positive - indicates short-term momentum is slightly stronger than long-term momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** 0.7 (+) (Short-term increase in relative deviation suggests short-term upward movement)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 1312.1% (Significant potential for long-term outperformance vs. S&P 500 with a buy-and-hold strategy)

**Analysis:** The low MRI suggests a generally stable market environment. The RSI is neutral, indicating no strong overbought or oversold conditions. The PPO being slightly positive supports the bullish signal from the moving averages. A hybrid signal indicates that it is a good time to buy some shares but to proceed with caution. The recent positive change in relative deviation could signify an upward trend in stock prices. The extremely high expected return should be viewed with skepticism. It is unlikely that a stock will outperform the S&P 500 by that large of a margin.
