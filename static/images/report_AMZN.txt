**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the longer term, reflected in its substantially higher cumulative return. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the significant volatility, evidenced by periods of substantial negative returns and high MDD (Maximum Drawdown). The recent price action suggests a short-term uptrend, but the high RSI indicates potential for a near-term correction.  The positive PPO and expected return suggest a strong bullish outlook for long-term investors.  Financial statements show growth in revenue and a generally positive trend in profit margin and ROE.  Further analysis is needed to determine the drivers of volatility and the sustainability of the growth trends.  Careful risk management is crucial given the historical volatility of AMZN.
