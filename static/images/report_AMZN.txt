**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), AMZN shows a slightly lower cumulative return (-2.6% difference).  The relative divergence of 6.4% suggests its current underperformance isn't exceptionally unusual compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this is a snapshot in time and doesn't account for volatility or future performance.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed results. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is generally positive, the periods 2020-2024 show significant negative returns, highlighting the considerable risk associated with AMZN. Alpha values are mostly positive, suggesting some degree of outperformance compared to the market, but the Beta consistently above 0 indicates significant market sensitivity.

* **Closing Price:** $186.54
* **Last Market Price:** $189.98
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $176.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $182.07
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $203.77

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent slight decrease (-$0.12) is not significant enough to indicate a sharp decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 54.67 (Slightly above neutral, not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.56 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.5% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 456.2% (significantly above S&P 500)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the MRI suggests medium risk, the PPO indicates bullish momentum.  The negative relative divergence change and the price being below its moving averages suggest caution.  The high expected return is a significant positive, but this should be viewed cautiously as projections are highly uncertain.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2025-05-02 | 1.62 | $155.67 B    |
| 2024-11-01 | 1.46 | $158.88 B    |

| 2025-05-02 | 1.00 | $143.31 B    | *(Note: Possible data error - duplicate entry)*

Earnings show a mixed trend.  There's a potential data entry error as the last line duplicates an earlier entry. Excluding this duplication, EPS and revenue show some fluctuation but generally positive growth. Further investigation is needed to assess whether the trend is sustainable.

| 2024-03-31 | $216.66B   | 4.81%  |

Revenue shows some volatility, while profit margins remain consistently high. Equity and ROE also demonstrate growth but exhibit fluctuation.  The high profit margins are a positive sign, but the revenue fluctuations warrant further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN's performance relative to the S&P 500 is currently slightly below, although not exceptionally so based on historical comparisons.  Recent price action suggests a possible downward trend.  Technical indicators present a mixed outlook, and earnings data shows some volatility but generally positive growth (with the caveat of a potential data error). Financial information indicates strong profit margins but fluctuating revenues and equity.  The high projected long-term return is appealing but needs to be considered alongside the risks highlighted by the Beta and the recent underperformance compared to the market.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for recent underperformance and the validity of the very high long-term projected return is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The considerable data inconsistencies (particularly in the earnings data) necessitate careful scrutiny of the data source's reliability.
