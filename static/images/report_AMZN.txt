EPS shows a positive trend, although the data contains a duplicate entry that needs clarification.  Revenue is also increasing.  Further analysis is needed to determine the overall health of the company's earnings.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis. This missing data needs to be obtained for a complete picture of Amazon's financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has historically outperformed the S&P 500,  demonstrating significant growth potential. However, recent price action shows a short-term downtrend.  Oversold RSI levels and a negative PPO suggest potential for a bounce back, but the negative relative divergence and bearish momentum warrant caution.  The positive trend in EPS and revenue is encouraging, but the missing financial data prevents a complete assessment.  The high expected return (52.4% relative to S&P 500) over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years) is a significant positive, but it should be considered in the context of the inherent risk of the stock market. Further investigation into the duplicate entry in the earnings data and obtaining complete financial statements are essential for a more conclusive analysis.
