## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 270.78%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.09%. The difference is 149.7%, placing it at the 62.8th percentile of the historical range of the relative divergence between AMZN and VOO.  This suggests strong historical outperformance, though past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent performance over different periods. While some periods display high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and significant Alpha (outperformance relative to the benchmark), other periods show substantial negative returns and high maximum drawdown (MDD). The consistently near-zero Beta indicates a relatively low correlation to the overall market. This underlines the high volatility and the importance of considering the specific timeframe when evaluating performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $234.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $236.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $227.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $218.65

The price is currently below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend. However, it remains above the 60-day moving average, suggesting some longer-term support.  The recent price change (-$1.03) from the previous close signals a minor negative movement that requires attention.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 67.98 –  Suggests the stock is in overbought territory, potentially indicating a short-term pullback is possible.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.36 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum, aligning with the positive 20-day relative divergence.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.2 – This indicates a recent short-term price increase.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 42.7% – This represents an expected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investors. This should be considered with caution, as it's a projection and not a guarantee.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS (Earnings Per Share) and revenue. However, there appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-11-01.  Consistency in data reporting should be verified. The upward trend suggests strong revenue and profitability.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-11-01 | 1.46 | 158.88        |
| 2024-08-02 | 1.29 | 147.98        |
| 2024-05-01 | 1.00 | 143.31        |
| 2023-10-27 | 0.96 | 143.08        |
| **2024-11-01** | **0.96** | **143.08** | *Duplicate Entry?*


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a generally increasing trend, although there is some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation. Profit margins appear to be relatively stable and healthy, though they experienced a slight dip in Q4 2023.

**Capital and Profitability:** Both equity and Return on Equity (ROE) show a consistent upward trend, suggesting improving financial health.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN demonstrates significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, the data also reveals periods of high volatility and substantial drawdowns. While recent earnings suggest continued growth, the RSI indicates potential short-term overvaluation. The positive PPO and expected long-term return remain promising.  Investors should carefully consider the risk/reward profile, given the stock's historical volatility and the current overbought condition suggested by the RSI.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry is needed. A long-term perspective is advisable given the high growth potential but also the historical volatility.
