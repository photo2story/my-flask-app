## Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.  The cumulative return for AMZN is 292.61%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 124.78%. The difference is 167.83%, placing it at the 52.34th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a min/max range of -3.28% to 323.64%).  The provided alpha values generally suggest outperformance relative to the market, although this has been less consistent recently.  Beta values indicate a higher volatility than the market in some periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Price:** $201.7
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $207.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $198.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $188.81

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a slight downward trend in the short term. However, it's above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential longer-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (59.2):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (0.04):** A positive value suggests a bullish momentum, although very close to neutral.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (6.63%):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend.

Given the price of $201.7 is below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day averages, there is no evidence of a sharp upward or downward movement.  The expected return of 18.83% over a long-term horizon (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant positive.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue.  However, without comparative data (e.g., analyst estimates), the actual performance versus expectations cannot be fully assessed.  The most recent earnings report (2024-11-01) shows EPS of $1.46 and revenue of $158.88 billion.  This data requires comparison to analyst expectations for proper evaluation of market response.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The Revenue and Profitability data shows fairly consistent revenue growth, though profit margins appear to have decreased slightly in the most recent quarter compared to the previous one (though slightly higher than the quarter before that).  Capital and Profitability metrics (Equity and ROE) show growth, indicating generally healthy financial standing. However, a deeper analysis is needed to evaluate the underlying drivers of these trends.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

(This section requires real-time data. Please provide links to recent news articles for a comprehensive analysis.  I need access to current events to accurately report on recent earnings announcements from sources like Shacknews and Finbold, market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.)


**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Amazon has shown significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, with a substantial difference in cumulative returns.  Recent price action indicates a slight short-term decline, but longer-term trends remain positive. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment.  Financial performance shows consistent revenue growth, although profit margin fluctuations warrant further investigation.   A comprehensive assessment requires additional information on the most recent earnings release (compared to expectations) and a review of current news and analyst sentiment. The predicted long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is encouraging, particularly for long-term investors.
