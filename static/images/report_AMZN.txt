**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the long term, based on the cumulative return data.  Recent price action shows a strong short-term uptrend, but technical indicators (high RSI) suggest the stock may be overbought and prone to a correction. Earnings reports show increasing EPS and revenue, although year-over-year performance has slowed. The long-term expected return is significantly positive, but the current overbought conditions warrant caution.  A comprehensive analysis would require access to more data points, particularly expected earnings and analyst ratings, to provide a more complete picture.
