*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** This is the average annual growth rate over the period. Notice the significant drop and even negative CAGR in recent periods (2020-2025).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** This is the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period, indicating risk.  MDD has been relatively high.
*   **Alpha:** This measures the stock's performance relative to a benchmark. Negative Alpha suggests underperformance. Amazon has shown consistently negative Alpha figures in recent periods.
*   **Beta:** This measures the stock's volatility compared to the market. A Beta around 1 indicates volatility similar to the market. Beta has been fluctuating, showing how AMZN reacts to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization in Billions.

**Analysis:**

*   Amazon's historical performance (2016-2019) showed strong growth and positive Alpha. However, recent years (2020-2025) have been marked by negative returns, negative Alpha, and high drawdowns, indicating significant challenges in outperforming the market.
*   High market capitalization is shown consistently.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 226.5

*   **60-day SMA:** 229.39

**Analysis:**

The stock price is above all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day). This *could* be a short-term bullish signal, suggesting the stock price has been trending upward recently.

*   **Mixed Signals:** The technical indicators and news are giving mixed signals. The recent price action and some analyst opinions are positive, while the expected return is extremely negative.
*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Data Reality:**  There is a disconnect between the strong "Buy" ratings from analysts and the challenging performance data. This suggests analysts may be focusing on long-term potential or growth drivers that aren't yet reflected in current returns.

Investing in Amazon at this point appears risky. While the company shows solid financial fundamentals, improving earnings, and analyst optimism, the recent underperformance, very negative expected return compared to the S&P 500, and mixed signals from technical indicators warrant caution. A potential investor should carefully weigh the positive earnings trend, innovation in AI, with the negative indicators, like divergence from market returns and high MDD, as well as monitor the company's progress in addressing its current challenges.
