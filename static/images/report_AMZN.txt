## Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Summary and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 154.7 percentage points (274.62% - 119.94%).  The relative divergence of 64.8% indicates that AMZN's performance has outperformed the S&P 500 by a substantial margin, considering historical volatility. However, this is a relative measure and should be analyzed with other factors.  The provided Alpha values of consistently near zero suggest that the outperformance is primarily due to market-wide factors (as reflected in the Beta) rather than stock-specific factors.  Note the significant negative CAGR values in recent years highlight a period of underperformance, while a recent rebound is evident in the 2023-2025 data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has shown a historically strong performance compared to the S&P 500, although recent years indicate significant volatility.  While the current RSI suggests potential near-term correction, the PPO and relative divergence indicators point to short-term upward momentum.  The long-term expected return is promising, but significant risk is present given the observed volatility.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons for the fluctuations in CAGR and the duplicated earnings data to better assess risk and potential returns.  A thorough review of the company's future prospects, including competitive landscape, strategic initiatives, and macroeconomic factors, is crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.
