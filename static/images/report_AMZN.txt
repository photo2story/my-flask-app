The difference is 137.3%, placing it at the 57.7th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 based on the provided data. This indicates AMZN's strong historical performance relative to the broader market, though past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided CAGR data shows highly variable performance year-over-year, highlighting the volatility inherent in AMZN's stock price.  The negative CAGRs in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 demonstrate periods of significant underperformance.
