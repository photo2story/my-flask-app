AMZN shows significant long-term growth potential, outperforming the S&P 500 considerably. However, the data also highlights significant short-term volatility and recent underperformance.  While the financial statements indicate robust financial health, the high market risk indicator and negative technical indicators (PPO, below-average RSI) signal caution.  The high projected long-term return should be interpreted cautiously given the inherent risks.  Further analysis is needed to investigate the duplicate earnings entry and the significant drops in performance observed in certain periods.  A long-term investment strategy, coupled with careful risk management, might be suitable for investors with a high risk tolerance.  More detailed research, including an examination of AMZN's business strategy and competitive landscape, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
