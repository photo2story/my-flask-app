**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

* **Cumulative Return (AMZN):** 79.97%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 82.57%
* **Return Difference (AMZN vs VOO):** -2.6%
* **Relative Divergence:** 6.4% (This indicates AMZN's performance is slightly below VOO, but within the normal range of historical divergence.)


**1. Performance Comparison (AMZN vs VOO):**

Amazon's cumulative return slightly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The -2.6% difference, considering the historical range of divergence, suggests the underperformance is not significantly alarming. However, further investigation into the drivers of this underperformance is necessary.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different periods.  The alpha values, ranging from -0.0 to 1.0, indicate periods of both underperformance and outperformance relative to the market (as measured by beta).  The negative CAGR values in recent years, along with high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values, highlight significant volatility and losses.  The consistently high beta values suggest that AMZN's price movements are strongly correlated with the overall market.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes of these fluctuations.

* **Closing Price:** $186.54
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $176.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $182.07
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $203.77

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price increase (Last-market data shows a positive change of 3.29) could be a temporary bounce within this trend.  Further observation is necessary to confirm.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 54.67 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.56 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.5 (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 456.2% (This extremely high figure requires further scrutiny and clarification of methodology.  It's unlikely to be a reliable prediction without a detailed explanation.)

The recent price increase of 3.29 needs further analysis to determine whether it is a temporary bounce or the start of a new trend. The conflicting signals from the technical indicators require further analysis and consideration of other factors before making any investment decisions.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon's performance has been volatile recently, with periods of strong growth followed by significant declines. While the company shows strong revenue growth and generally improving profitability,  the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the high volatility raise concerns. The high expected return figure needs significant clarification and validation.  A more comprehensive analysis, including a deeper dive into the company's financial statements, industry trends, and competitive landscape, is necessary to form a well-informed investment opinion.  The provided data is insufficient to make definitive recommendations.  Consult with a financial professional before making any investment decisions.
