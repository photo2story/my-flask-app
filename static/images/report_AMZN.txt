The difference is 171.6%, placing it at the 53.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $205.74 (Last Market: $205.79)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $202.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $203.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $192.12

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.33 (Slightly below neutral; not oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.36 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.1 (Indicates a recent short-term upward trend)

The conflicting signals from the RSI and PPO suggest a period of consolidation or uncertainty. The positive relative divergence change supports the short-term uptrend observed in the moving averages.  A price of $205.79 doesn't indicate a significant sudden jump or drop; it's consistent with the overall short-term uptrend. The expected return of 223.7% over the long term (2+ years) represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, given the current valuation.  However, this projection needs to be treated cautiously, as it's highly sensitive to various assumptions and market conditions.

The provided earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue, though there's some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but recent performance is less dramatic.

The long-term expected return is substantial but must be viewed with caution. A more complete picture would require accessing recent news, analyst reports, and a more complete analysis of the financial statements relative to industry benchmarks.
