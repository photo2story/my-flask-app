Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), AMZN has significantly outperformed over the analyzed period, exhibiting a cumulative return of 227.88% versus VOO's 112.87%.  The difference of 115.01% signifies a substantial outperformance, but the relative divergence suggests this level of outperformance is near the median of its historical range.


**Analysis of Alpha and Beta:**

The provided data shows a fluctuating alpha and beta across different time periods. While positive alphas (2017-2019, 2018-2020, 2019-2021, 2021-2023, 2022-2025)  indicate outperformance compared to the market, negative alphas (2015-2017, 2020-2022) show underperformance.  The beta generally shows high market sensitivity, particularly in the later periods.  The high CAGR in several periods (74%, 74%, 71%, 120%, 90%) are offset by significant negative returns (-91%, -86%) in other periods, highlighting the volatility of AMZN's performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $208.74
* **5-day Moving Average:** $213.04
* **20-day Moving Average:** $227.56
* **60-day Moving Average:** $225.89

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price change (-$2.62) from the previous close indicates a small downward movement, not a significant drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (15.98):**  Indicates the stock is significantly oversold, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible, but not guaranteed.
* **PPO (-1.21):** Shows negative momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-5.3):** Indicates a short-term downward trend in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (67.7%):**  This high expected return implies a strong potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This is contingent on the stated assumptions used for the return calculation and should be treated as a projection.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has historically shown strong growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests a potential downturn.  Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) point towards oversold conditions and bearish momentum, respectively.  While the long-term expected return is high, the current market sentiment is negative. The recent earnings show growth, though further analysis is needed to account for potential data inconsistencies.  Investors should consider the volatility inherent in AMZN and carefully weigh the risks and rewards before investing.  The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity, making AMZN a riskier investment compared to the broader market.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price decline and the consistency of the earnings data is warranted.
