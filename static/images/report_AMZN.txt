## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 249.30%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference is 132.9%, placing it at the 55.9th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong outperformance, though the relative percentile suggests periods of underperformance have also occurred.  The Alpha consistently shows near zero, indicating the returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta). However, the significant positive CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in most periods indicates that AMZN has been a strong performer.  The negative CAGR in 2020-2023 is notable and requires further investigation.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $219.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $223.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $211.80

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 53.5% above S&P 500. This represents a significant outperformance expectation, but should be treated cautiously due to market volatility and inherent uncertainty. The provided value represents only an expectation. A lower expected return is likely considering the recent downward trends.  The market price of 221.43 is not significantly different from the closing price and does not suggest rapid price movements.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly,  demonstrating robust growth. Recent financial data shows positive trends in revenue, earnings, and profitability. However, the negative CAGR between 2020-2023 and the current RSI and PPO suggest some caution. While the long-term outlook remains positive given the company's position and financial strength, current short-term indicators suggest a potentially bearish trend. The high expected return should be considered within the context of market risk. Further investigation into the reasons for the negative CAGR period and data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The technical indicators suggest a potential bounce from oversold territory, but further confirmation is needed.
