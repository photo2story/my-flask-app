## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Summary and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last day in the data is 144.2 percentage points.  This places AMZN in the 60.5th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, indicating relatively strong outperformance but also significant historical volatility.  The provided Alpha values consistently around zero suggest the stock's performance largely tracks the market (Beta is high), with limited outperformance independent of market movements.  Note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $230.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $223.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $223.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $213.09

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  The recent price change shows a slight increase (+2.11) from the previous close. This is not a dramatic price movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.53 (Neither overbought nor oversold; neutral territory)
* **PPO:** -0.0286 (Slightly negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +4.6 (Positive, indicating recent short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 46.1% (This is a significant outperformance compared to S&P 500, but it's a forward-looking estimate and subject to considerable uncertainty.)

The recent price increase is moderate and does not indicate a dramatic surge.  The combination of indicators presents a mixed signal: while short-term momentum is positive, longer-term indicators suggest a slightly bearish sentiment.  The high expected return is encouraging but needs to be considered within the context of potential risks.
