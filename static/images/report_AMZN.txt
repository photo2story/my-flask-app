* **Closing Price:** $171.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $185.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $194.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.39

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The recent price change of -$4.15 suggests a potential downward momentum.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 30.57 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce)

* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -3.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 189.2% (Significant potential outperformance of VOO over 2+ years)

The combination of an oversold RSI and negative PPO suggests a potential short-term rebound, though the high MRI indicates considerable risk.  The significant expected return reflects the long-term potential, but should be viewed cautiously in light of the current market conditions. The large negative price change (-$4.15) supports the short-term downward trend.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Amazon shows a mixed picture.  While the long-term outlook suggests significant potential outperformance relative to the S&P 500, the short-term trend is bearish, indicated by the price action and technical indicators. The recent earnings show growing revenue but some EPS volatility.  The high market risk indicator and recent negative price movement suggest caution is warranted.  A long-term investment approach might be suitable given the high projected long-term returns, but careful monitoring of market conditions is essential.  Further investigation into the reasons for recent price declines and EPS fluctuations is recommended before making any investment decisions.
