*   **Recommendation:** Given the recent upward trend, cautiously bullish Hybrid Signal, and strong financial performance, a small buy position (as per Hybrid Signal) could be considered, especially for long-term investors.

The long-term expected return is very attractive, but requires a commitment to a long-term investment strategy. Recent news and events warrant careful monitoring of the stock for any significant shifts in the business environment.
