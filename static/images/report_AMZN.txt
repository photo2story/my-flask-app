## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last date in the provided data is 138.7%, placing it in the 58.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates AMZN has outperformed VOO considerably over the observed period.  However, the provided data shows periods of significant underperformance as well (e.g., 2020-2023).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha consistently shows 0.0, suggesting AMZN's returns are strongly correlated with the market (high Beta).  The high beta values confirm this, particularly during 2015-2019 and showing considerable market sensitivity, especially in down-market periods (2020-2023).  The high CAGR figures (Compound Annual Growth Rate) during several periods highlight periods of strong growth. However, the significant negative CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values in 2020-2023 underscore the risk associated with AMZN investments.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $225.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $221.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $222.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $212.41

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  However, it's more significantly above the 60-day moving average, showing a stronger upward trend over the longer term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 48.59  - This indicates a relatively neutral market sentiment, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.2988 -  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum. This contradicts the price movement shown by the moving averages.  Further investigation is warranted to reconcile this discrepancy.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +2.0 (short-term upward trend).
* **Expected Return:** 49.5% - This is a significant expected return over the long term (2+ years), indicating a potential for substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, this estimate needs to be viewed in context with the high volatility shown in previous years. The current price of $225.94 is not exceptionally high given historical volatility, so no significant  "sudden jump" warrants special attention.

The projected long-term expected return is substantial, but investors need to consider the inherent risk associated with this volatility.  Further due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The conflicting signals from the PPO and moving averages necessitate a deeper dive into the underlying market dynamics.
