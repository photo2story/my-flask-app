## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between AMZN and VOO is 183.3% (313.02% - 129.75%). The relative outperformance, considering the historical range of this difference, places AMZN at the 57.1st percentile.  This indicates that AMZN's outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is substantial, but not necessarily at an extreme historical high.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility, with periods of substantial gains and losses. Notably, the period from 2020-2023 shows substantial negative returns (-110% and -107%), suggesting significant market headwinds for the stock during that time.  Recent recovery is reflected in the 2022-2024 CAGR of 58%.  The relatively consistent alpha of around 0.1 suggests some degree of manager skill in generating returns above the market benchmark, however it is important to note that this alpha is not extremely high. Beta consistently around 0.1 also suggests the company's returns do not correlate extremely strongly with market performance.  The market capitalization has grown significantly over the period, although it is worth bearing in mind that the values shown are approximate.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $213.44
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $209.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $206.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $193.91

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish short-to-medium-term trend. The Last-market price ($217.64) being higher than the closing price implies a recent uptick.  This small divergence between close and last market price could signify potential volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.67 (slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.10 (positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (-). This indicates a recent short-term relative weakening of the stock against the S&P 500. However, the meaning is unclear without further details.
* **Expected Return:** 211.2%. This is a significant expected return.  This is likely based on a discounted cash flow, multiple or similar valuation method rather than simply a projection of current trends. The context should clarify the basis of this estimate and its reliability.  The claim that this is the S&P 500 *excess* return for a 2+ year horizon needs further clarification.  

The Last-market price of $217.64 is slightly higher than the closing price, but not indicative of a significant sudden increase (no evidence of a *sharp* uptick).
