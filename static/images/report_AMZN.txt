AMZN has shown a history of strong performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over certain periods. However, it has also experienced significant volatility and substantial drawdowns. The current price is below key moving averages and technical indicators suggest oversold conditions but also bearish momentum.  While the long-term expected return is positive, the significant volatility necessitates a risk-tolerant approach.  Further due diligence, including a deeper analysis of the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is recommended before making any investment decisions. The high volatility and potential for significant drawdowns should be carefully considered.  The expected return is a projection and not a guaranteed outcome.
