**1) Performance Comparison:**

Amazon's cumulative return of 71.81% lags slightly behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 72.42% over the analyzed period.  The difference is a small -0.6 percentage points.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying performance relative to the market (Beta) and excess return (Alpha) across different time periods.  While exhibiting periods of high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and market-beating performance (positive Alpha), more recent years (2020-2025) demonstrate significantly negative CAGRs and increased Beta, suggesting higher market sensitivity and underperformance relative to the benchmark.  Note that the high Beta in recent years is likely driving the negative alpha.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $167.32
* **5-day Moving Average:** $175.19
* **20-day Moving Average:** $185.56
* **60-day Moving Average:** $206.57

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price change of -$3.06 (-1.77%) indicates a small negative movement.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.41 (Approaching oversold territory; below 30 is generally considered oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.43 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.9% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 386.5% (This is a very high expected return and needs further justification and context.  It's likely a long-term projection and should be considered with caution).  This high expected return significantly outweighs the current underperformance relative to the S&P 500.

The combination of indicators suggests a bearish short-term outlook, but the high expected return could warrant a longer-term investment strategy if the underlying assumptions are sound.

**6)  Overall Analysis:**

Amazon's short-term performance is lagging slightly behind the S&P 500, indicated by the negative relative divergence and technical indicators suggesting a bearish trend. However, the company demonstrates strong financial fundamentals with increasing revenue, relatively stable profit margins, and growing equity. The high projected long-term expected return of 386.5% is highly significant and requires validation of the underlying assumptions.  The conflicting signals between short-term underperformance and high long-term projections suggest a need for careful consideration of investment timeframe and risk tolerance.  Further investigation into the drivers of the projected 386.5% return and potential risks is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate earnings entry) also require further clarification.
