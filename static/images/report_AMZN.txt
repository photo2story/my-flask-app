2025-01-17 - Analysis Report
Here's an analysis of Amazon (AMZN) based on the provided data, presented as a report.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last date in the dataset is 132.9 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 55.9% indicates that AMZN's performance is in the upper range compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, remember that this is a relative measure and not an absolute indicator of future performance.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 249% over the period 2015-2025 is exceptionally high, highlighting the strong growth experienced.  Despite this impressive growth, the Alpha of 133% suggests a significant outperformance relative to the benchmark, while the Beta of 0 suggests it is uncorrelated with the market. The market capitalization is substantial at $2324 Billion.  The maximum drawdown (MDD) of 53% underscores the risk associated with the investment.


**2. Recent Price Movement**

* **Closing Price:** $221.04
* **Last Market Price:** $221.14
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $219.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $223.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $211.80

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and above the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potentially sideways or slightly bearish trend in the short-term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 38.77 - This indicates that the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce but not confirming an uptrend.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.49 -  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** -1.1% - This points to a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 53.5% -  This is a significant expected excess return over the S&P 500 if investing for the long term (2+ years).  However, this projection needs to be viewed with caution and should be considered alongside other factors. The provided data does not include the calculation methodology for this, so independent verification is recommended.
* **Last Market Price Consideration:** The Last Market Price of $221.14 is very close to the closing price and does not indicate any significant sudden jumps or drops.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis**

The earnings data shows a general upward trend in both EPS and revenue, although there's a slight dip in revenue in Q3 2024.  The provided data includes some duplicated entries (2024-11-01, 0.96, 143.08B$), requiring clarification to ensure accuracy.  A more detailed analysis would require identifying the correct data and investigating the reasons behind the fluctuations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis**

**7. Overall Summary**

AMZN shows strong long-term growth significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend, with the stock currently in oversold territory.  While the long-term outlook appears positive based on the expected return and historical performance, the high beta and substantial MDD highlight the inherent risk.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and a clearer understanding of the expected return calculation methodology are necessary.  The current price position near the 20-day moving average and above the 60-day moving average suggests a potential short-term consolidation phase before a possible uptrend.  Investors should monitor the situation closely, assessing news, fundamental analysis, and other factors before making investment decisions.
