**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has shown strong cumulative returns outperforming the S&P 500. However, its performance has been volatile, with periods of significant gains and losses.  Recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, although the last market price shows a slight positive movement.  Earnings show growth in revenue, but EPS is volatile. Financial information demonstrates strong profitability and growth in equity and ROE.  The medium-risk MRI score should be considered.  A thorough analysis incorporating fundamental and technical factors, along with risk assessment, is crucial before making any investment decision.  The long-term expected return needs further justification and sensitivity analysis to account for various market conditions.  Given the historical volatility, a long-term investment approach might be suitable for risk-tolerant investors.
