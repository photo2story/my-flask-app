## Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with considerable volatility.  Recent earnings show growth but profit margins are relatively stable.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Amazon's cumulative return (275.15%) significantly surpasses the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.63%).  The difference (154.5%) places it at the 64.7th percentile of historical divergence between AMZN and VOO.  This suggests AMZN has historically outperformed VOO, but also experienced periods of underperformance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance. While high CAGR values are observed in several periods, significant maximum drawdowns (MDD) highlight risk.  Positive alpha values in recent years (2017-2025) suggest outperformance relative to the market, particularly in 2021-2023. Beta fluctuates significantly; it was lower during some periods and high recently which indicate higher volatility.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has shown a strong upward trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon shows a strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the longer term. However, it's a volatile stock with periods of substantial drawdowns.  Recent earnings indicate growth, but the price drop suggests a potential short-term correction, possibly due to an overbought condition. The high expected return, supported by positive long-term trends and high alpha, suggests that long-term investment may be beneficial, although its volatility needs to be carefully considered.  Further analysis considering macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape would provide a more complete picture.  Finally, the duplicate data point in the earnings data should be investigated and corrected.
