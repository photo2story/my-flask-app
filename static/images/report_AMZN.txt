## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Report

**1. Performance Summary and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 272.01% for AMZN versus 122.83% for VOO.  This results in a return difference of 149.2%, placing it at the 62.6th percentile of the historical range of the difference between the two.  While this indicates strong outperformance, it's crucial to consider the risk involved, as evidenced by the high maximum drawdown (MDD) in certain periods.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha values are consistently near zero, suggesting that the stock's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta).  However, the high beta values (especially in earlier periods) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Noteworthy is the significant negative CAGR (-78% and -84%) and extremely high MDD in the 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 periods, highlighting periods of substantial underperformance. The recent recovery is reflected in a positive CAGR in the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $229.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $224.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.75

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively small change in price from the previous close ($0.17) indicates modest recent price movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 69.48.  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70), suggesting potential for a short-term correction.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.42.  A positive value indicates upward momentum.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +5.3. This indicates a short-term upward trend.

* **Expected Return:** 43.1%.  This represents a significant potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This projection needs to be considered in the context of the substantial risk shown in past periods.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue, although there's some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.  The data also seems to contain a duplication of the October 2024 entry.  Further investigation is needed for data quality assurance.  A more robust analysis would require a longer time series.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has shown a remarkable long-term return, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this outperformance has not been consistent, with periods of significant underperformance and high volatility. The current price is above its moving averages, suggesting a bullish short-term outlook. While the RSI is approaching overbought territory, the positive PPO and relative divergence suggest continued upward momentum in the short term.  Long-term potential remains strong, but the high risk should be carefully considered.  Investors should assess their risk tolerance before investing, paying particular attention to the historical periods of significant losses.  Further investigation is needed to resolve the duplicate earnings data entry.  A deeper dive into the underlying drivers of revenue and profit margin changes, along with sector analysis, is crucial for a complete picture.
