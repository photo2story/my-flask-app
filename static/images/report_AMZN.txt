## 9️⃣ Comprehensive Summary

- **Performance vs Market:** Amazon lags the S&P 500 by ~44 % and sits near the bottom of its historical return range (rel. divergence 8.5 %).  
- **Short‑term momentum:** RSI over‑bought but PPO positive; price above 5‑day SMA but below 20‑/60‑day SMAs, hinting at a consolidation phase.  
- **Risk profile:** MRI of 0.70 places it in the medium‑risk band; expected long‑term return vs S&P 500 is negative, so upside is limited for a 2‑year horizon.  
- **Fundamentals:** Revenue and EPS are growing, margins strong (~50 %), and ROE steady (~6 %).  
- **Analyst view:** Strong‑buy consensus with a target range 12 % above current price; no recent rating shifts.  
- **News & Catalysts:** Recent forecast reset, layoff chatter, competitive comparisons, and a potential new product (“Amazon Leo”) could provide upside.  

**Bottom line for a Discord audience:** Amazon shows solid fundamentals but is underperforming the broader market and exhibits short‑term over‑bought conditions. A medium‑risk, short‑term play with a bullish signal may be attractive, but a long‑term hold may face a negative relative return. Use the analyst targets as a ceiling for a potential upside while staying alert to news catalysts.
