* **Closing Price:** $228.68

* **Change:** -$0.73 (-0.32%)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $230.78
* **20-day Moving Average:** $234.12
* **60-day Moving Average:** $223.86

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.

* **PPO:** -0.62 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Deviation Change:** -1.6% (Short-term downward trend)

The relatively small negative price change (-0.32%) doesn't suggest a dramatic event.  The combination of RSI, PPO, and relative deviation change points toward a bearish short-term trend.  The expected return of 49.7% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is noteworthy, potentially making it attractive for long-term investors despite current short-term bearish indicators.
