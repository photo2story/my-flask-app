Over the analyzed period, AMZN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return substantially higher than the benchmark.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has shown a strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, although recent performance has been more volatile.  The relatively high expected long-term return is promising, but comes with inherent risk given the observed volatility. Short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend, but the long-term outlook hinges on sustained revenue and earnings growth, coupled with improvements in efficiency reflected in a higher ROE.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the fluctuating alpha and beta, as well as the duplicated data point in the earnings report, is recommended before drawing definitive conclusions.  The provided data should not be the sole basis for investment decisions; independent research and consideration of individual risk tolerance are crucial.
