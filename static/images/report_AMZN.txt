*   **Monitor News & Earnings:** Stay informed about recent developments and analyst opinions.
*   **Consider Risk Tolerance:** Be aware of the potential for volatility and large drawdowns.
*   **Long-Term Potential:** The high expected return supports a long-term, strategic investment approach.
*   **Potential Pullback:**  Given the RSI, consider waiting for a potential pullback before increasing positions.
