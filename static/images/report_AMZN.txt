## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.  The provided data shows significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), but with recent price declines and bearish technical indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Amazon's cumulative return of 211.24% significantly outpaces the S&P 500's 108.62% return.  The provided relative divergence of 43.6% indicates that Amazon's performance currently sits in the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this historical outperformance needs to be considered in the context of recent volatility.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance. While periods from 2015 to 2021 show high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and positive Alpha (outperformance relative to the market), 2020-2023 demonstrates significant negative returns and substantial maximum drawdowns (MDD). Note the volatile Beta (market sensitivity), increasing significantly in 2021-2023, before decreasing back towards 1.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects Amazon's growth over the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $199.25
* **5-day Moving Average:** $203.43
* **20-day Moving Average:** $217.69
* **60-day Moving Average:** $224.75

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price drop of $1.45 (-0.72%) is notable but not exceptionally large in context of the recent volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 19.91  (Significantly below 30, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.99 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -6.0% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 81.2% (This suggests significant long-term (2+ years) outperformance over the S&P 500 given a long-term investment horizon)

The low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the negative relative divergence, strongly suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  The daily price change of -0.72% reflects a minor correction within this downward trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-01 | 1.46    | $158.88 B    |

| 2024-11-01 | 0.96    | $143.08 B    | *(Note: Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*


Earnings show a general upward trend in both EPS and revenue, although the November 2024 data point has a duplicate entry which needs clarification. The relatively stable or slightly declining revenue numbers raise concerns about consistent growth.

Equity and ROE show a clear upward trend, indicating strong capital growth and improving profitability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but current data suggests a bearish short-term outlook.  While financial indicators suggest strong underlying fundamentals (growing equity and relatively stable profit margins), the negative technical indicators (RSI, PPO, relative divergence) and the price action below its moving averages point towards a potential continuation of the downward trend.  The high expected return is contingent on a long-term investment horizon and the eventual reversal of this current bearish sentiment.  Further investigation is warranted to clarify the duplicate entry in the earnings data and assess the potential impact of recent market events.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for future growth against the current market risks.
