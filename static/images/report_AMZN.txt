* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.39

The negative price change and relatively low RSI value suggest the potential for a short-term bounce. However, the high MRI, negative PPO, and significant downtrend in price compared to moving averages paint a cautionary picture.

**6. Summary:**

AMZN has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent performance shows a significant downturn. While the current price suggests oversold conditions and potential for a rebound, the high market risk indicator and negative momentum indicators suggest caution. The long-term outlook remains positive, with high projected returns, but this should be evaluated in light of the current volatility and market conditions.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data entry and a comparison to industry benchmarks is necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.  The high beta suggests substantial risk.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for long-term growth against the current volatility and risks before making investment decisions.
