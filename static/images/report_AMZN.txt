However, the high CAGR in several periods demonstrates significant growth, though this growth has been significantly negative in more recent periods.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires external information.  The prompt does not provide any recent news or analyst opinions.  To provide a comprehensive analysis, current news articles and analyst reports regarding Amazon's performance and outlook would need to be consulted.

Further analysis incorporating recent news and analyst opinions is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
