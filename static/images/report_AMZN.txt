**7. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon shows a history of strong outperformance against the S&P 500, but its recent performance has been weaker.

Further investigation is needed to clarify the duplicated data point in the earnings report and the reasons behind the recent underperformance.  The projected long-term outperformance warrants consideration, but investors should carefully monitor the market trends and the company's performance before making any investment decisions.
