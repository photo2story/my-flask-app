**1) Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a fluctuating Alpha and Beta over the years. While Alpha is positive in the recent years (2021-2025), suggesting outperformance relative to the market,  it's essential to note the significant negative returns (-91% and -86%) experienced in the 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 periods.

The substantial variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlights the risk associated with AMZN investment.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and Revenue. However, there's a duplicate entry for 2024-11-01. This needs clarification.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-01 | 1.46 | 158.88 B$ |
| 2024-08-02 | 1.29 | 147.98 B$ |
| 2024-05-01 | 1 | 143.31 B$ |
| 2023-10-27 | 0.96 | 143.08 B$ |
| 2024-11-01 | 0.96 | 143.08 B$ |


**5) Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profit Margins demonstrate a generally upward trend.  Similarly, Equity and Return on Equity (ROE) show growth though the ROE is relatively low compared to other high-growth companies.  The data suggests a healthy financial position for Amazon, although ROE shows room for improvement.


| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $187.79B | 19.90% |
| 2024-09-30 | $158.88B | 19.51% |
| 2024-06-30 | $147.98B | 19.14% |
| 2024-03-31 | $143.31B | 19.50% |
| 2023-12-31 | $169.96B | 17.22% |

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $285.97B | 7.00% |
| 2024-09-30 | $259.15B | 5.91% |
| 2024-06-30 | $236.45B | 5.70% |
| 2024-03-31 | $216.66B | 4.81% |
| 2023-12-31 | $201.88B | 5.26% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Amazon exhibits a high growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 in the long run, as suggested by the high cumulative return and projected long-term expected return. However, it also carries substantial risk, indicated by high Beta values, significant MDD, and periods of substantial negative returns. The current price is below its moving averages suggesting a short-term bearish trend, while oversold conditions (RSI) suggest potential for a rebound.  The recent earnings data presents a positive outlook, but the duplicate entry requires clarification.  A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) with a tolerance for volatility might be suitable for investors targeting high potential returns, however careful monitoring of market conditions is crucial due to the company's inherent volatility.  Further research into the duplicate earnings data entry is necessary before forming a definitive conclusion.
