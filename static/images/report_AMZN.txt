**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $178.41
* **Previous Close:** $196.01
* **Change:** -$8.98  (Significant daily drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $189.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $195.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $215.25

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The recent large negative daily change (-8.98) highlights significant price volatility and potential negative market sentiment.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 33.29 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.26 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.7% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 321.9% (Long-term, 2+ years,  potentially a very optimistic projection and needs further justification and analysis)

The combination of an oversold RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence change suggests bearish short-term momentum, although the RSI suggests potential for a price increase.  The projected long-term excess return requires additional support and context to validate its high value.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-11-01 | 1.46  | $158.88 B     |

| 2024-11-01 | 0.96  | $143.08 B     | *(Note: Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*

Revenue shows a relatively stable to slightly increasing trend. EPS also demonstrates an upward trend, although the duplicate entry in November needs clarification.  A more detailed analysis would require investigating the reason for the duplicate entry and possibly access to additional financial statements and analyst reports.

**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profit margins show a generally healthy trend, although there's some fluctuation.  ROE indicates a strengthening trend in profitability relative to equity.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Amazon's recent performance shows mixed signals. While earnings show a positive trend, the stock price is currently below its moving averages and has experienced a recent significant drop. Technical indicators suggest bearish short-term momentum but potential for a bounce.  The large projected excess return compared to the S&P 500 needs significant justification.  A more thorough analysis would require examining additional factors such as macroeconomic conditions, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects.  Furthermore, several data points, specifically the alpha values in the historical analysis and the duplicate entry in the earnings data, need further clarification and validation.  The data provided is insufficient to fully support the presented 321.9% long-term expected return.
