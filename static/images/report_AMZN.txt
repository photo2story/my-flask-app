## Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company focused on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 144.2 percentage points. This places AMZN's performance at the 60.5th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, indicating above-average performance but with considerable volatility as shown by the wide range of the relative performance index (max: 241.0, min: -4.3).

The provided alpha values consistently show near zero, indicating the stock's performance is largely driven by market movements (high beta).  The high beta values (around 1) show high sensitivity to overall market movements.  However, the significant difference in cumulative returns highlights periods of outperformance despite this beta.  Noteworthy is the substantial negative CAGR experienced between 2020-2023, underscoring the risk associated with high-growth stocks.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $213.09

The price is currently above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. The recent price change shows a positive trend, with a significant increase compared to the previous close.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.53 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions).

* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** 4.6 (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.
