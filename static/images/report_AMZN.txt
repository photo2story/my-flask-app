**0) Executive Summary:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company focused on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.  This report analyzes Amazon's recent performance, comparing its returns to the S&P 500 (VOO), and evaluating key financial metrics and technical indicators.  The analysis reveals significant outperformance against the S&P 500 historically, but recent performance shows a decline with mixed signals regarding future prospects.

**1) Cumulative Return Comparison:**

* **AMZN Cumulative Return:** 211.24%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 108.62%

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $203.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $217.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $224.75

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price drop of $0.72 (-0.36%) is relatively small and doesn't indicate a significant sudden change.

* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 81.2% (Long-term (2+ years) potential outperformance)

The low RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, but the negative PPO and recent relative divergence indicate bearish momentum.  The significant expected return is a long-term projection and should be considered cautiously.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Amazon has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, but recent price action shows a downtrend.  While technical indicators suggest potential for a bounce (oversold RSI), bearish momentum is present.  Fundamental analysis shows positive growth in revenue, EPS, equity, and relatively stable profit margins, suggesting a generally healthy financial position. However, further investigation is needed to clarify the duplicate earnings data and to fully assess the sustainability of the long-term growth projections. The significant long-term expected return should be considered within the context of the inherent volatility of the stock.  A cautious approach with a long-term investment horizon is advised, carefully monitoring the company's future earnings reports and macroeconomic conditions.
