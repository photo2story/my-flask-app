**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN significantly outperforms the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative returns.  However, its performance exhibits substantial volatility.

While recent earnings show growth in revenue and EPS, it's essential to consider the inherent risks associated with this level of volatility.  The projected long-term expected return is substantial, but it's crucial to recognize that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The absence of recent news and analyst opinions limits a more comprehensive assessment.  More data, particularly regarding market sentiment and future expectations, is needed for a complete picture.
