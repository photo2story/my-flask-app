The cumulative return of AMZN is 298.27%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 125.6%.  The difference is 172.67%, placing it at the 53.82nd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -3.28% and a maximum difference of 323.64%).

* **Closing Price:** $204.61
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $206.9
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $199.3
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $189.3

The price is currently slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting some recent downward pressure. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend in the medium to long term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI:** 59.89 (Slightly below overbought territory, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.1 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum, though very close to neutral)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +7.68 (Positive, indicating a short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 18.88% (significantly above the S&P 500, reflecting the potential long-term outperformance noted earlier).

The price sits comfortably above both the 20 and 60 day moving averages, indicating a lack of recent significant volatility.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data shows a consistent upward trend in revenue, with slight fluctuations in EPS and profit margin. Recent quarters (Q3 and Q2 2024) show strong revenue growth and maintain relatively healthy profit margins.  However, a comparison to earnings expectations is required to determine whether the most recent earnings met or exceeded expectations.  The data lacks this crucial information.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

The provided financial statements reveal generally strong revenue growth and healthy profit margins throughout the observed period.  The revenue increase from Q3 2023 to Q3 2024 is substantial.  While Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates, it remains positive and generally indicates efficient utilization of shareholder equity.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has demonstrated significant historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, though this outperformance has varied across periods.  Current indicators suggest a moderately bullish outlook, with the price above key moving averages.  Positive revenue growth and generally healthy profit margins further support a positive view, though a lack of earnings expectations comparison prevents a definitive conclusion on the most recent earnings report.  The high expected return suggests significant potential long-term gains, however this long term outlook is highly dependent on the macroeconomic environment and continued positive company growth and earnings.  Technical indicators are mixed, but the overall outlook is cautiously optimistic.  Further analysis of recent news is necessary to account for very recent market changes and potential risks.
