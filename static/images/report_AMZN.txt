## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 154.7%, representing a substantial outperformance.  The relative outperformance (64.8%) indicates that AMZN's performance is in the upper 64.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided data.  The provided alpha consistently shows near zero, suggesting that the outperformance is not necessarily due to manager skill but rather sector-specific or market factors.  However, the high beta values (mostly above 1) show that AMZN's price movements are more volatile than the S&P 500.  Note that high CAGR values are observed in some periods, but are followed by significant negative returns in other periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $237.07
* **5-day Moving Average:** $236.18
* **20-day Moving Average:** $226.43
* **60-day Moving Average:** $217.84

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downward trend. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend in the medium to long term.  The recent price change (-$0.45) represents a small daily decline, not significant enough to indicate a sharp drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 73.10 – This suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating potential for a short-term pullback.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.49 – A positive value indicates upward momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.0 – Shows a short-term upward trend in relative strength.

The combination of high RSI and positive PPO suggests a potential short-term correction might be due, even though recent relative strength shows an upward trend.  The high expected return (40.2%) over the long term (2+ years) suggests significant potential outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this should be considered in light of the high volatility evident in past performance data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a generally upward trend in both EPS and revenue, albeit with some quarterly fluctuations.  Note that the data shows duplicate entries for 2024-11-01. This needs clarification to perform a proper analysis. Assuming that the duplicate is an error, the trend shows a positive growth trajectory.  Further analysis would require examining the profitability ratios relative to this revenue growth.


| Date        | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-11-01  | 1.46 | 158.88        |
| 2024-08-02  | 1.29 | 147.98        |

| 2023-10-27  | 0.96 | 143.08        |


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Both revenue and profitability show a largely positive trend, although profit margins have slightly decreased after reaching a high in Q3 2024.  The growth in equity is significant, indicating substantial company growth. ROE shows variability but largely indicates a consistent positive return on equity.


| Quarter     | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE     |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $158.88       | 19.51%        | $259.15      | 5.91%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $147.98       | 19.14%        | $236.45      | 5.70%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $143.31       | 19.50%        | $216.66      | 4.81%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $169.96       | 17.22%        | $201.88      | 5.26%   |
| 2023-09-30 | $143.08       | 17.15%        | $182.97      | 5.40%   |


**7. Overall Summary:**

AMZN has historically shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a large cumulative return differential. However, this outperformance has been volatile, with periods of extremely high growth followed by significant declines.  Currently, the stock shows signs of short-term overbought conditions (high RSI) despite positive momentum (positive PPO and recent relative strength). While long-term prospects appear strong, given the projected high expected return and generally positive financial data, caution is warranted due to the historical volatility and current overbought technical signals.  Investors should consider a long-term perspective and carefully manage risk given AMZN’s high beta.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data is necessary for a more complete analysis.
