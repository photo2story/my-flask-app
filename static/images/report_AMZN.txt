## Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 326.76%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 130.81%.  The difference is 196.0 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 61.0 indicates that AMZN's performance relative to the S&P 500 is in the upper 61st percentile of its historical range (based on a minimum divergence of -3.3% and a maximum of 323.6%).  While AMZN's past performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500, this is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility, with high growth periods alternating with substantial declines.  The high beta (generally above 0.1) indicates that AMZN's price is highly sensitive to overall market movements. The alpha values, while consistently positive, are relatively modest (0.1).  This suggests that while AMZN outperformed the market over these periods, the outperformance is not dramatically large above what would be expected given its high beta.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $220.55
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $214.15
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $207.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $195.15

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  However, this should be viewed in context with broader market conditions.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 59.48.  This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, though it is closer to overbought territory.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.51. A positive value indicates that the price momentum is bullish.

* **Recent Relative Divergence:** The 20-day relative divergence shows a recent decline (nan -).  This suggests that the stock’s recent outperformance is slowing.

* **Expected Return:** A projected 198.8% return over a long-term (2+ years) investment period is claimed, significantly exceeding the S&P 500’s anticipated return.  This projection should be treated with caution and is heavily reliant on the accuracy of the model generating this expectation. The current price of $220.56 is not explicitly stated to be unusually high or low in relation to the other data provided which makes it difficult to determine if there is a recent sharp price move.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires up-to-date information from news sources and financial analysis sites to be completed.  Information on recent earnings announcements, market outlook, and analyst opinions is not provided within the initial prompt.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a significantly higher cumulative return.  However, recent relative divergence suggests a potential slowdown in this outperformance.  The company shows relatively healthy financial fundamentals with consistent revenue and moderate profit margins, albeit with some fluctuations.  Technical indicators present a mixed signal, with a slightly bullish PPO but RSI suggesting a less extreme upward momentum.  A long-term investment outlook suggests a high expected return, but this must be considered speculative given it's not clear how this projection was derived.  A complete picture needs updated news and analyst sentiment.
