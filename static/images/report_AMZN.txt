**1. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying performance of AMZN compared to the market (as proxied by the S&P 500) over different periods.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is generally high,  the significant negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 highlights periods of substantial underperformance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon shows a history of strong growth, but with periods of significant volatility.  The high beta reflects this risk.  While the current price is below key moving averages and RSI suggests oversold conditions,  the high expected return projection should be viewed cautiously given the recent underperformance and high risk profile. The recent earnings data show growth, but more consistent data is necessary for a robust assessment. A thorough fundamental analysis, including a competitive landscape review and a detailed examination of future growth prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The significant projected long-term return needs to be carefully assessed given the high volatility.  Investors should consider their own risk tolerance and diversification strategy.
