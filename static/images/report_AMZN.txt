## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 270.26%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.78%.  The difference is 148.5%, placing it at the 62.2nd percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 based on provided data (max difference: 241.2%, min difference: -4.3%).  This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, although this is relative and does not guarantee future performance. The alpha consistently shows near zero, indicating that the outperformance might be mostly due to the higher beta (market sensitivity), especially during periods of strong market growth.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $232.93
* **Last Market Price:** $231.20
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $228.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $214.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $199.90

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing and last market price suggests minimal intraday volatility on the last trading day.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 84.75 – This indicates the stock is currently in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback might be imminent.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.57 – A positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +4.1 – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.

The provided "Expected Return" of 119.8% over the long term (2+ years) is a substantial claim. This needs further justification and clarification on its underlying methodology and assumptions to be considered credible.  The high RSI suggests caution, as an overbought condition often precedes a price correction.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price is small and doesn't suggest a sudden, significant price jump or drop.

* **Revenue Growth Trends:** Revenue growth has been inconsistent across the quarters, showing both positive and negative growth.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS has shown a mostly upward trend, with significant growth in the latest reported quarter.
* **Beats or Misses:**  Without expectation data, it's impossible to determine if the reported EPS and revenue figures exceeded or fell short of expectations.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which was not provided in the initial prompt.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN shows strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. Recent price action suggests an upward trend, but the high RSI warns of potential overbought conditions.  Earnings show significant EPS growth in the most recent quarter, though revenue growth has been less consistent.  Further analysis is needed to fully assess the current valuation, future outlook, and confirm the exceptionally high projected long-term return.  The missing news and analyst opinions significantly limit the scope of a comprehensive analysis.
