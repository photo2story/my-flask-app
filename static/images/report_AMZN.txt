**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  While generally exhibiting a beta above 1 (meaning higher volatility than the market), the alpha (excess return relative to the market) has fluctuated significantly, ranging from a high of 240.7% to a negative -39.6%, reflecting periods of both significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The market capitalization also experienced significant growth over the observed period.

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 279.1% | 26.6%  | 240.7%  | 1.1  | 614.9  |
| 2016-2018  | 135.8% | 32.9%  | 103.5%  | 1.4  | 789.7  |
| 2017-2019  | 145.2% | 32.9%  | 93.5%   | 1.5  | 971.5  |
| 2018-2020  | 173.9% | 32.9%  | 126.6%  | 0.9  | 1712.3 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $202.61 (Last Market: $202.59)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $208.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $197.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $188.40

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it is above its 60-day moving average, which may indicate a longer-term bullish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 61.74 - This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, implying a neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.38 - A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum, though relatively weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +7.6 (20-day) - This indicates short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 18.79% - This is the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.  This prediction needs further validation given the variable historical performance.

The closing price of $202.59 is not significantly different from the reported closing price of $202.61 and doesn't signal a dramatic recent event.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data shows a generally increasing trend in revenue and EPS, though growth is not consistently strong and shows some variability.

The expected return remains high, but careful consideration of historical volatility is crucial.  A thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions is essential to form a comprehensive outlook.
