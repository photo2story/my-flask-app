**1. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a fluctuating Alpha and Beta over the years.  While Alpha is generally positive in recent years, indicating outperformance against the benchmark,  Beta fluctuates, suggesting varying levels of market sensitivity.  It's crucial to note that the high CAGR figures are partially influenced by the significant growth of Amazon in the early years covered. The negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 reflects a period of market correction and specific challenges faced by the company.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth except for a slight dip in 2020-2022.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) shows considerable risk, particularly during 2020-2022 and 2021-2023, indicating significant price declines.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a strong long-term growth potential.  However, recent performance has been weaker, with the stock price currently trading below its moving averages and exhibiting oversold conditions (RSI). While the long-term outlook is positive (as reflected in the high expected return),  the recent downturn and the substantial maximum drawdowns shown in the Alpha-Beta analysis highlight the significant risk associated with the investment.  Investors should carefully consider the volatility and potential for further short-term price declines before investing. The current deep oversold condition and the long-term positive outlook suggest a possible long-term investment opportunity, but thorough due diligence and risk management are crucial.  Further investigation into the reasons behind recent performance fluctuations and potential future growth drivers are recommended before making any investment decision.  The duplicate entry in the recent earnings data requires clarification.
