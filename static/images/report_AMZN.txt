2024-12-27 - Analysis Report
## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

This report analyzes Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), a global e-commerce and cloud computing company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon's cumulative return (260.91%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.68%).  The difference is 140.2%, placing it in the 58.9th percentile of the historical range of the difference between AMZN and VOO's returns.  This indicates that AMZN has substantially outperformed the market benchmark over the analyzed period.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant volatility in AMZN's performance. While some periods demonstrate exceptionally high growth (e.g., 2018-2020 at 120%), others exhibit substantial negative returns (e.g., 2020-2022 at -91%). The consistently near-zero alpha suggests that AMZN's performance is largely explained by market movements (beta), although significant deviations from this occur during specific periods.  The high Beta values also confirm a high market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $227.05
* **5-day Moving Average:** $225.87
* **20-day Moving Average:** $222.77
* **60-day Moving Average:** $204.06

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 57.24 –  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions, suggesting a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.38 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.  This contrasts with the positive price movement as measured by the moving averages, warranting closer examination.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.7 – This indicates short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 49.1% – This represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance of the S&P 500, assuming current trends continue. Note: This value should be viewed cautiously, and the considerable volatility observed should be factored into any investment decisions.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Both revenue and EPS show growth over the last few quarters, although not consistent.  There's a slight dip in revenue in Q2 2024 before returning to a higher number in Q3 2024.  EPS increases steadily in the first two quarters of 2024, with a minor drop reported in Q4 2023 (which is repeated in the duplicated data row for Q4 2024).  Without further context such as earnings expectations, it's impossible to assess whether the results were beats or misses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Shows growth, although the trend is not perfectly linear, with a slight dip in Q2 2024.
* **Profit Margin:** While generally stable, it fluctuates around the 17-19.5% range, with a slight increase in recent quarters.
* **Equity:** Shows consistent growth throughout the period, demonstrating overall financial strength.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** The ROE is relatively stable, reflecting efficient capital utilization. However, there is a notable dip in Q1 2024.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

The provided data lacks information about recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions.  This crucial context is missing for a comprehensive analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon's performance has been highly volatile, exhibiting periods of exceptional growth and significant declines. While the recent price action shows a short-term uptrend, the conflicting signals from the PPO and moving averages require further investigation.  The high expected return compared to the S&P 500 is promising, but substantial risk associated with its volatility should be considered.  Missing data on recent news and analyst sentiment prevents a complete and well-rounded assessment.   Further investigation into the reasons behind the periods of significant growth and decline is necessary, along with a deeper analysis of current market conditions and expert opinions.

**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data, Amazon shows strong long-term potential, but inherent volatility demands a cautious approach.  The inclusion of missing information regarding recent news, analyst sentiment, and earnings expectations is crucial for a more informed investment decision.
