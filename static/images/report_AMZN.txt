**0. Key Figures:**

* **Cumulative Return (AMZN):** 227.88%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 112.87%
* **Return Difference:** 115.01%
* **Relative Divergence:** 48.6% (Indicates AMZN's performance is in the upper 48.6th percentile relative to its historical performance compared to VOO)


**1. Company Overview and Performance Analysis:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

AMZN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return more than double that of the index.  The relative divergence shows that while the outperformance is substantial, it's not at its historical maximum compared to VOO.

The provided CAGR data reveals high growth rates (71-120%) in several periods, but also substantial negative returns (-86% to -91%) in others, highlighting the volatility of AMZN's stock.  The alpha values indicate periods of outperformance (positive alpha) and underperformance (negative alpha) against the market,  with consistently high beta values implying high market sensitivity.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows a strong growth trend, despite the periods of negative returns.  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures illustrate substantial risk associated with investing in AMZN.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $208.74
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $213.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $227.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $225.89

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downward trend.  The recent price drop (-$2.62 or -1.22%) from the previous close reinforces this bearish signal.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 15.98 (Extremely oversold; potential bounce but also risk of further decline)
* **PPO:** -1.21 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.3% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 67.7% (Significantly outperforms VOO over the long term, assuming the trend continues)

The extremely low RSI suggests the stock may be oversold and ripe for a rebound, however, the negative PPO and relative divergence suggest that downward momentum is continuing. The large negative change in the previous close price points to a potential continued downward trend. The high expected return suggests significant long-term potential, but only if the negative short-term momentum reverses.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-01 | $1.46  | $158.88B      |
| 2024-08-02 | $1.29  | $147.98B      |
| 2024-05-01 | $1.00  | $143.31B      |
| 2023-10-27 | $0.96  | $143.08B      |
| 2024-11-01 | $0.96  | $143.08B      |

Note: There's a duplicate entry for 2024-11-01.  Assuming the first entry is correct, revenue shows a growth trend but EPS also fluctuates significantly. Further analysis is needed to assess the underlying drivers of these figures.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a slight decline in Q3 2024 followed by an increase in Q4 2024. Profit margins remain relatively stable and high, above 17%.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity steadily increased throughout the year, indicating strong financial health. ROE (Return on Equity) also shows a fluctuating but generally upward trend, suggesting effective use of capital.


**6. Overall Summary:**

AMZN has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, the stock is currently experiencing a period of substantial volatility and negative short-term momentum.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, potentially setting the stage for a rebound, but this is countered by the current negative momentum.  Strong financial fundamentals and a high projected long-term return suggest a potential investment opportunity for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance.  The recent price drop and negative momentum warrant caution, and thorough risk assessment is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent EPS and revenue fluctuations is needed to form a more complete investment thesis.
