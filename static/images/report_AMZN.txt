*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows the average annual growth over the period.  The CAGR has declined significantly in recent periods, even turning negative.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  The MDD is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the stock's performance relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500, though not explicitly stated here). A positive alpha indicates outperformance, while a negative alpha indicates underperformance.  Amazon's alpha has been consistently negative in recent periods, indicating underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock's price will move with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the stock is more volatile than the market. Amazon's beta has been increasing, suggesting higher volatility.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization in Billions. Shows the growing size of the company.

**Analysis:**

*   Amazon's historical performance (2015-2019) showed strong growth and positive alpha. However, in recent years (2020-2025), the company has experienced significantly lower growth, negative alpha, high MDD, and increasing beta. This suggests increased risk, potential underperformance relative to the market, and greater volatility.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 233.22
*   **Previous Close:** 229.16
*   **Change:** 1.77
*   **5-day SMA:** 227.804
*   **20-day SMA:** 236.7098
*   **60-day SMA:** 228.1969

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is above the 5-day and 60-day SMAs, but below the 20-day SMA.  This suggests a short-term bullish trend (above 5 & 60 day SMA), but a longer-term correction (below 20-day SMA). The positive change of 1.77 indicates some upward momentum.

**3. RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommendation).  This suggests the MRI is relatively safe.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 39.64. This suggests that Amazon is approaching "oversold" conditions. (Typically, below 30 is considered oversold).
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.4574. Negative PPO suggests a downward trend, but it's relatively close to zero, indicating the momentum is not strong.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00). This suggests a recommendation to allocate all available cash to purchasing the stock, considering it a very safe investment given the MRI.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -3.3 (-): Short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** 391.3%. This is a very high expected return over a 2+ year period, significantly exceeding the S&P 500.

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation and a "very safe" signal.  However, the RSI indicates it may be approaching an oversold condition, which could signal a potential buying opportunity. The very high expected return is a major positive. However, it's crucial to remember that such high expectations often come with significant risk.

*   **Strong Growth Potential:**  The company is demonstrating growth in earnings, revenue, and equity. The growth of AWS and AI are positive catalysts.
*   **High Risk, Potentially High Reward:** The high expected return (391.3%) suggests significant potential upside, but investors should be aware of the risks, as evidenced by the high MDD in the alpha/beta analysis.
*   **Positive Indicators:** Recent analyst upgrades, coupled with positive news around AWS and Black Friday sales, could indicate a turnaround is underway.

**Recommendation (Caveat: This is NOT financial advice):**

The data suggests a potential buying opportunity, *but with caution*.  The high expected return and positive analyst outlook are compelling. However, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the high MDD, and the increasing beta indicate a higher risk profile.

Therefore, consider:

*   **Due Diligence:** Conduct further research and consult with a financial advisor.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Assess your personal risk tolerance. If you are risk-averse, this may not be the right investment.
*   **Diversification:** Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your portfolio.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:**  The expected return is based on a long-term (2+ year) investment horizon.

In summary, Amazon appears to be in a transition phase, with significant potential for future growth, but also with inherent risks. A cautious, well-informed approach is recommended.
