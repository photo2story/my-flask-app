**Analysis:** From 2015 to 2020, Amazon showed strong performance (high CAGR) with positive alpha and a beta around 1, indicating market-correlated volatility. However, in recent years (2020-2025), the company experienced significant volatility (high MDD), negative alpha, and a beta close to zero or negative, suggesting the stock's movements were less correlated with the broader market.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 238.24
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 230.33, 'previousClose': 238.24, 'change': -3.32}
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 233.62
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 229.13
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 224.15

**Analysis:** The stock price closed lower than the previous close, indicating a downward movement. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  However, the recent price drop to 230.33 and change of -3.32 needs attention as it suggests potential profit-taking or negative news impact.

### 3. Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3261 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 62.12 (approaching overbought territory, but not there yet)
*   **PPO:** 0.37 (Positive, indicates an upward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-05)
*   **Delta Previous Relative Divergence (20-day):** 0.7 (positive, indicates short-term upward momentum in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return:** 1306.0% (long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates low market risk. RSI suggests increasing buying pressure. The Hybrid Signal leans towards buying with caution and this suggests that the model is still bullish on AMZN, but advises caution. Recent increased relative divergence indicates short term upward momentum.  The extremely high expected return (over a 2+ year horizon) suggests a strong long-term outlook for AMZN's outperformance, though this should be viewed cautiously and considered alongside other factors.

### 4. Recent News & Analyst Opinions

**Recent News Headlines:**

*   Consumer stocks declining (general sector trend).
*   Stock market mixed (Dow down, S&P 500 potentially reaching record).
*   Focus on AI enablers like Oracle.
*   Amazon analysts see limited near-term AI boost from Anthropic.

**Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.33 (Strong Buy)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 263.18 / 306.00 / 225.00

**Analysis:** The news headlines present a mixed picture. While the overall market may be doing well (S&P 500), there's some weakness in consumer stocks.  The most relevant news item is that analysts see limited near-term AI boost for Amazon from Anthropic. This could be contributing to the recent price pullback. However, analyst consensus remains very positive, with a Strong Buy rating and a significant average target price above the current price, but the target price range is wide(225.00 ~ 306.00).

### 7. Overall Summary

AMZN has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, but the current outperformance is closer to the lower end of its historical range.

Technically, the stock shows a short-term upward trend based on moving averages, but the recent price drop and RSI nearing overbought territory warrant caution. Analyst consensus remains strongly positive. Fundamentals are strong, with growing revenue, high profit margins, and increasing equity. The extraordinarily high expected return suggests strong long-term potential, but should be considered cautiously.

**In conclusion:** AMZN presents a mixed picture. Long-term prospects appear positive based on fundamentals and analyst sentiment. However, short-term headwinds (news, technical indicators) suggest potential volatility. A cautious approach, considering the recent price action and news, is warranted.
