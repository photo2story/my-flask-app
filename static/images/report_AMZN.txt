## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 251.77%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 115.96%. The difference is 135.8%, placing it in the 57.1st percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates that AMZN's performance has been substantially higher than the S&P 500 over the measured period, although this high relative performance is not consistently seen across all periods shown in the CAGR data (see below).


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different periods. While some periods show significantly higher returns than the market (high CAGR, high alpha implicitly), others display substantial negative returns (massive negative CAGR). This suggests significant volatility and market sensitivity which is further supported by the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values.  The consistent near-zero beta readings across the different periods might not be completely accurate depending on the methodology used in the calculation.
