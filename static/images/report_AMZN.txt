**0. Summary Statistics:**

* **Ticker:** AMZN
* **Company:** Amazon.com Inc, a multinational technology company focusing on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.
* **Cumulative Return (AMZN):** 76.54%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 76.18%

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Amazon's cumulative return slightly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  The relative outperformance, however, is minor considering the historical volatility (max: 168.8%, min: -14.4%, current: 0.4%, relative rank: 8.1%).  The provided alpha and beta values show varying levels of outperformance (alpha) and market sensitivity (beta) across different time periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others, particularly recent years (2020-2024), reveal negative performance and relatively high beta, indicating high sensitivity to market movements. The significant drop in performance (negative CAGR) in 2020-2024 warrants further investigation.  Note that market capitalization (Cap(B)) increased significantly during this period despite negative returns.  This suggests other factors, such as increased market valuation unrelated to profitability, may be at play.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $172.61
* **Previous Close:** $174.33
* **5-day Moving Average:** $178.70
* **20-day Moving Average:** $187.00
* **60-day Moving Average:** $207.71

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price drop (-0.99) is relatively small, but it indicates ongoing downward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.61 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.20 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.1% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 355.7% (This represents significantly higher projected returns compared to the S&P 500, but this high number needs further validation and clarification on its calculation method. Itâ€™s likely based on a specific model and not a guarantee.)

The technical indicators suggest a bearish trend. However, the relatively low RSI and negative PPO values may indicate a potential bounce or reversal in the short term. The significant negative change in the relative divergence reinforces the bearish trend in the short term. The large expected return projection needs justification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon's performance has been mixed. While it slightly outperformed the S&P 500 in cumulative returns, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend.  However, its financial fundamentals (revenue, profitability, and equity) demonstrate strength. The high expected return projection needs further validation.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings) require clarification. A thorough analysis of Amazon's long-term growth prospects, competitive landscape, and potential headwinds is crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.  The provided data alone is insufficient for a definitive buy/sell recommendation.  More information is needed to properly assess risk and accurately assess the projected future returns.
