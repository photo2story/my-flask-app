**1) Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

AMZN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, showing a cumulative return 117.3 percentage points higher.  The relative divergence of 49.6% suggests that this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating Alpha and Beta values across different periods.  While generally positive alpha suggests outperformance, the highly negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 highlights significant periods of underperformance.  High Beta values (especially in 2021-2023) indicate a high sensitivity to market movements.  The substantial market capitalization (Cap(B)) growth illustrates Amazon's overall expansion.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 74.0% | 8.7% | -0.1 | 611.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 74.0% | 19.6% | 0.0 | 784.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 71.0% | 19.6% | 0.4 | 965.4 |
| 2018-2020  | 120.0% | 19.6% | 0.1 | 1701.5 |
| 2019-2021  | 90.0% | 8.4% | 0.1 | 1741.9 |
| 2020-2022  | -91.0% | 23.5% | 0.1 | 877.7 |
| 2021-2023  | -86.0% | 23.5% | 1.1 | 1587.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 59.0% | 23.5% | 1.1 | 2292.3 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $209.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $212.18
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $226.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $225.96

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The recent price change of -$1.45 reflects a minor downward movement.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 27.86 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.08 (Negative momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.8% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 65.3% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is projected over the long term.)

The low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the negative relative divergence, reinforce the short-term bearish trend.  However, the high expected return suggests a potentially strong long-term investment opportunity. The recent price drop is relatively small and doesn't indicate a significant event.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue.  There's some fluctuation but the overall direction is positive.  Note the repeated entry for 2024-11-01 with the same values. This inconsistency needs clarification.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-11-01 | 1.46 | $158.88 B     |

| 2024-11-01 | 0.96 | $143.08 B     |


**5) Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability tables show generally increasing trends in revenue. Profit margins are relatively stable, hovering around 19%. While equity is growing, ROE shows some fluctuation, suggesting potential efficiency variations. Further investigation is needed to fully interpret these trends.

| 2024-12-31 | $187.79B   | 19.90%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE   |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| 2024-12-31 | $285.97B   | 7.00% |

| 2023-12-31 | $201.88B   | 5.26% |


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

AMZN has historically shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. While recent short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend,  the long-term outlook appears positive, supported by a high projected return and generally increasing revenue and earnings.  However,  the data inconsistencies (duplicate entries in earnings data) and the highly variable beta need to be addressed before drawing definitive conclusions. A thorough analysis of the company's fundamentals, alongside a careful review of the inconsistent data points, is crucial for a more informed investment decision.
