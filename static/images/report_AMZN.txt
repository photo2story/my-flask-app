* **Expected Return (18.79%):**  This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500 assuming a continued outperformance.  This is a projection and carries significant uncertainty.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show a generally increasing trend.  However, we need more context, such as analyst estimates, to assess whether this meets or exceeds expectations.  The latest EPS of 1.46 (Nov 2024) needs comparison to analyst forecasts to gauge the success of the recent quarter.  Further details like revenue breakdowns and margins are essential for thorough analysis.
