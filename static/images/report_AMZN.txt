## Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 283.7%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 127.58%. The difference is 156.12%, placing it at the 48.76th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided maximum and minimum divergence values.  This indicates that while AMZN has substantially outperformed the S&P 500, its current outperformance is not at its historical peak.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows significant outperformance (high Alpha) in most periods, but also periods of higher Beta (market sensitivity) and even underperformance relative to the market (-11.5% and -4.6% CAGR).  The high Alpha values (above 1) show considerable excess return compared to the market, except in the periods where it underperformed. The market capitalization has grown considerably over the analysed period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $197.12 (Last market: $201.09)
* **5-day moving average:** $200.94
* **20-day moving average:** $201.28
* **60-day moving average:** $190.67

The price is currently slightly below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term downward pressure. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend. The difference between the last market price and the closing price might signal some volatility or a slight correction in the recent market.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (51.41):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (-0.72):** A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.  However, this needs to be viewed in conjunction with other indicators.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (3.24 +):** Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (33.27%):** This represents a significant potential outperformance of the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming a consistent trend. The significant difference between the last market price ($201.09) and closing price ($197.12) does not suggest a dramatic swing (either up or down) based solely on this small price gap.  Further analysis is needed.
