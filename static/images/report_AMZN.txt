**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN's performance has been mixed. While the long-term cumulative return has outperformed the S&P 500, recent performance has been significantly negative. The high expected return should be viewed cautiously in light of the current bearish technical indicators and the volatile alpha/beta relationship.  The recent price drop warrants attention, and further investigation into the underlying reasons for the recent decline is recommended.  Earnings show growth, but the rate of growth is decelerating.  Financial health appears robust, with increasing revenue and equity, but ROE needs further scrutiny.  A thorough risk assessment is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Consider consulting a financial advisor before acting on this information.
