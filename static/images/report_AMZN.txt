**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 257.53%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.71%.  The difference is 140.8%, placing it at the 59.1st percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max divergence). This indicates AMZN's strong historical outperformance relative to the broader market.  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $224.92
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $226.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $219.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $202.04

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting some recent price weakness. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 64.62 (Neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.32 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum, but relatively close to zero, implying a potential shift)
* **Recent Relative Divergence (20-day):** 0.0 (-), indicating a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 127.8%  This suggests a substantial potential for outperformance against the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming consistent past outperformance continues.  However, this is a projection, and there's no guarantee of achieving this return.  The current price of $224.92 doesn't necessitate adjustments to the analysis as no extreme price movements (e.g., sharp rises or falls) are indicated.
