## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.  The cumulative return of AMZN is 300.46%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%. The difference is 171.6%, placing it at the 53.5th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided max and min values).  This indicates a strong historical outperformance, though not necessarily indicative of future returns.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows varying results across different periods.  While Alpha consistently remains positive (indicating outperformance above the market benchmark) and Beta is generally above 1 (suggesting higher volatility than the market), there are periods of negative CAGR, highlighting market-specific risks.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $205.74 (Last Market: $205.79)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $202.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $203.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $192.12

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  It is significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a stronger upward momentum over the longer term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.33 - This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to the oversold territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.36 -  A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.  However, this should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +5.1 -  Indicates a recent short-term upward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** 223.7% - This represents a significant potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming continued historical trends.  However, this is a projection, and actual returns may vary.  The slight discrepancy between the last market price ($205.79) and the closing price ($205.74) is negligible and doesn't signal a significant jump or drop.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS and Revenue data show a consistent increase in both metrics over the past few quarters.  While the latest data points (2024-11-01) show a slight dip compared to the previous quarter, this is not necessarily alarming without context of expected earnings or broader market conditions.  A comparison to analyst expectations for the most recent quarter is crucial for a complete picture, which is missing from the data provided.

**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

The revenue and profitability data show generally healthy margins, though there was a dip in the profit margin in Q3 and Q4 2023.  ROE (Return on Equity) has also fluctuated but has remained above 4% throughout the period, suggesting reasonable efficiency in utilizing shareholder equity.  A deeper dive into the composition of revenue and expenses would provide further insights.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **(Missing Information):**  To provide a comprehensive analysis, I need access to recent news articles from sources like Shacknews and Finbold within the last two days,  including any earnings reports, analyst opinions, and recent market outlook.  This information is crucial to provide a current and accurate evaluation.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon (AMZN) exhibits strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, but recent indicators show a mixed signal. The stock shows solid growth in revenue and earnings, but the relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest a potential for near-term bearish pressure.  The long-term outlook, based on the provided expected return, remains positive, contingent upon macroeconomic conditions and sustained growth in its core businesses. However, the missing recent news and analyst sentiments significantly limit the overall assessment's accuracy. Further investigation into the latest earnings reports, news, and analyst outlooks are paramount for a well-rounded analysis.
