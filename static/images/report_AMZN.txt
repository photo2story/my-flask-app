* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 120.05%

**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company specializing in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.  Over the period analyzed, AMZN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return far exceeding that of the benchmark index.  The relative divergence shows that while AMZN's outperformance is substantial, it's not unprecedented within its historical context compared to VOO.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different years.  While positive alpha indicates outperformance, the significant negative returns in 2020-2022 suggest vulnerability to market downturns (high beta). The recent positive alpha and increased beta values from 2022 onwards suggest improved performance and higher correlation with market movement. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) increased significantly throughout the observed period.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon shows a history of strong performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. However, its performance has been volatile, particularly during market downturns.  Recent financial data suggests continued growth in revenue and profitability. While current technical indicators show mixed signals, the high expected return suggests that a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy could yield substantial returns compared to the S&P 500.  However, it's crucial to acknowledge that past performance is not indicative of future results, and thorough due diligence, including consideration of current market conditions and potential risks, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate data entry in the recent earnings requires clarification.
