## Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 249.30%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference is 132.9%, placing it at the 55.9th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates strong outperformance, but the relative percentile suggests periods of both better and worse performance compared to the benchmark.  The provided alpha values of consistently near zero suggest that the outperformance may not be solely due to manager skill (alpha), but rather due to the higher beta of Amazon compared to the S&P 500.  The high beta is also highlighted in the provided CAGR analysis.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility in both CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD). While some periods show exceptional growth, others demonstrate substantial losses. The consistently near-zero alpha across all periods suggests that the stock's performance is largely driven by market movements (beta) rather than manager skill. The high beta consistently reflects higher risk and volatility compared to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $221.04
* **Last Market Price:** $221.89
* **5-day Moving Average:** $219.91
* **20-day Moving Average:** $223.06
* **60-day Moving Average:** $211.80

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend, but above the 60-day moving average indicating longer-term support.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 38.77 – This suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, which could signal a potential bounce.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.49 – A negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.1 – This confirms the short-term bearish trend.

Given the Last Market Price of $221.89 being slightly above the Closing Price, there's no significant evidence of a sudden jump or drop.  The indicators generally point towards a short-term bearish trend, but the RSI nearing oversold territory could suggest a rebound.


**Expected Return:** 53.5% – This is a significant expected return over the S&P 500, particularly considering the risks associated with Amazon's volatility.  However, long-term (2+ years)  dollar-cost averaging is crucial to mitigate the risk of significant losses.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data show a generally upward trend in both EPS and Revenue, with some minor fluctuations.  However, more context is needed to draw definitive conclusions;  the table appears to contain duplicate entries (2024-11-01 and 0.96/143.08B is repeated).

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals relatively stable revenue growth, although the most recent quarter (2024 Q3) shows a slight dip compared to Q4 2023, likely attributable to the seasonal nature of this business.  Profit margins remain reasonably high and consistent.  Return on Equity (ROE) shows some fluctuations, but generally indicates a profitable use of shareholder equity.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon shows significant long-term growth potential, considerably outperforming the S&P 500 historically. However, its high volatility and beta necessitate a cautious approach.  The recent technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend, although the RSI is approaching oversold territory, potentially signaling a short-term bounce.  The high projected return warrants consideration, but careful risk management through dollar-cost averaging over a long timeframe is essential.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry is recommended.  A thorough analysis of the company’s future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors is vital before making any investment decisions.
