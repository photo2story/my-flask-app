**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 286.15%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 126.85%.  The difference is 159.3%, placing it at the 49.73rd percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data's min/max range.  This indicates that while AMZN has substantially outperformed the market, its current outperformance is not at its historical peak.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows varying performance over different time periods. While alpha consistently indicates outperformance against the market (except for 2020-2022 and 2021-2023), beta suggests that AMZN's price movements are generally more volatile than the S&P 500 (beta > 1). Market capitalization has increased steadily over the observed periods.

* **Closing Price:** $198.38 (Last Market: $198.33)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $202.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $200.81
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $190.25

The price is currently below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term bullish trend.  The slight difference between the closing price and last market price suggests minimal immediate volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 50.46 – This indicates a neutral market sentiment, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.52 – This suggests a bearish momentum, as the value is negative.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 5.11 (+) – This suggests a short-term upward trend in relative performance against the S&P 500.

Given the price of $198.33 is not significantly different from the closing price, there is no evidence of a sharp upward or downward movement.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue.  However, the repetition of the 2024-11-01 data point needs clarification.  A comparison with analyst expectations for the most recent quarter is needed to fully assess the performance.  This requires access to external data sources, such as analyst estimates from financial news sites.


**5. Financial Information:**

The Revenue and Profitability data shows relatively stable profit margins ranging from 17% to nearly 20%.  Capital and profitability (ROE) fluctuate but generally remain above 5%. This is positive, but further context and trend analysis are required to fully interpret the significance.

*(This section requires accessing real-time news sources like Shacknews, FINBOLD, etc., within the last 48 hours to provide relevant information on earnings announcements, market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.  I cannot access real-time information.)*  Please provide the news articles for analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has historically outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating significant growth.  While recent performance has been more moderate, the long-term outlook, based on historical data, appears positive.  However, the current price is slightly below short-term moving averages and the PPO suggests bearish momentum.  The RSI is neutral.  Technical indicators show conflicting signals.  Further investigation into the most recent earnings report (including analyst expectations) and news events is critical for a complete assessment. The expected return of 33.19% over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500 is a significant positive factor, suggesting potential value for long-term investors.  However, this is dependent on the accuracy of the forecast and market conditions.


**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, AMZN shows a long-term positive trend but some short-term uncertainty.  The significant historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is a strong positive. However,  a comprehensive analysis requires accessing real-time news, the complete earnings report, and comparing the latest results to analyst expectations.  Further investigation is needed before making any investment decisions.
