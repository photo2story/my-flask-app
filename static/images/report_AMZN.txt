**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 132.8%, placing it at the 55.9th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests a strong outperformance, although the relative outperformance is not consistently high based on the provided data.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided alpha values are all close to zero, indicating that the stock's performance is largely explained by market movements (Beta also near 0 in some periods).  However, the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant volatility, with periods of extremely high growth followed by substantial declines.  The maximum drawdown (MDD) also highlights periods of significant risk.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth over the period.

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.6998 - Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.1 - Shows a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 53.7% - This represents a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, if the current price ($218.46) is factored in with the other information.  This needs additional context and verification.  Given the high volatility shown in the past, there's significant risk.
