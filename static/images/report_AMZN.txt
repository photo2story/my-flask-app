## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 271.11%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 122.16%. The difference is 149.0%, placing it at the 62.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  The provided alpha consistently shows near zero, suggesting the outperformance is primarily due to factors beyond the market's general movement (beta is high, suggesting significant market sensitivity).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures for several periods, punctuated by significant negative returns in 2020-2022. This highlights AMZN's volatility.  The consistently near-zero alpha suggests that while AMZN has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in several periods, this outperformance might be explained mainly by its high beta (market sensitivity).

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has historically shown substantial growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. While recent performance is positive, the RSI suggests potential for a short-term correction.  However, the long-term outlook appears strong, supported by increasing revenue, healthy profit margins, and growing equity.  The high beta means that it will likely be significantly impacted by overall market movements.  Further investigation is needed to validate the duplicated earnings data point. The projected high expected return requires cautious consideration, given inherent market volatility.  Despite the promising picture, careful risk management is crucial for any investment strategy.
