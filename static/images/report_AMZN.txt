## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Amazon (AMZN) is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 259.68%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.62%.  The difference is 142.1%, placing it at the 59.7th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests AMZN has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but the extent of outperformance fluctuates considerably.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant volatility, with periods of extremely high growth followed by substantial declines.  The high Beta values (generally above 1.0) indicate that AMZN's price is more volatile than the overall market.  The Alpha values consistently at -0.0 suggest that, after accounting for market risk, AMZN did not generate excess returns consistently relative to its risk, meaning its higher returns are mainly due to higher risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $227.61
* **5-day Moving Average:** $222.54
* **20-day Moving Average:** $225.76
* **60-day Moving Average:** $207.97

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it is significantly above its 60-day moving average, implying a stronger upward trend over a longer period.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.17 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.54 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 47.6% (Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500)

The current price of $227.61 doesn't appear to represent a dramatic, sudden spike (either upward or downward) based on the moving averages.  The positive divergence suggests short-term positive momentum, while the negative PPO signals a bearish trend.  The substantial expected return highlights the potential for long-term growth, but this is subject to considerable market risk.
