*   **News:** Recent news is mixed, with some positive articles about Amazon and its competitive positioning, as well as broader industry news.

**Conclusion:**

While AMZN has faced recent challenges (reflected in its underperformance and some negative alpha values), several indicators suggest potential for future growth. The oversold RSI, strong analyst ratings, positive earnings trend, and promising long-term expected return (though needs to be viewed with caution) could point to a potential buying opportunity.  However, it's crucial to consider the high volatility (MDD) and the increasing beta, indicating higher sensitivity to market movements. A decrease of 1.3% at the latest market could be a cause for concern, signaling a potential issue that warrants further investigation.
