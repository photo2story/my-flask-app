**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 292.12%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.31%.  The difference is 163.8%, placing it at the 51.1th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  This suggests that while AMZN has historically outperformed VOO, its current outperformance is not at its extreme historical high.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant variation year-over-year, with periods of strong growth followed by periods of stagnation or even decline (2020-2022).  The high beta values consistently above 1 indicate that AMZN's price is more volatile than the overall market.  The alpha values show periods of significant outperformance, especially in earlier years, but this has diminished more recently.
