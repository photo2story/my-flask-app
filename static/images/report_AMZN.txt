* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 492.5% (Significantly higher than the S&P 500, which needs further justification to be credible).

The RSI suggests potential overbought conditions.  While the PPO is positive, the negative relative divergence change indicates some short-term bearish pressure.  The high expected return requires additional context and validation.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue          |
|------------|--------|-------------------|

There appears to be an error in the data; there are duplicate entries for May 2024.  Assuming the duplicate is removed,  revenue shows some fluctuation, while EPS displays a general upward trend, though it is somewhat volatile. Further analysis is required to assess the underlying drivers of this performance.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

AMZN's recent performance has been mixed, showing slightly weaker returns compared to the S&P 500 in the provided data.

The financial statements indicate a consistently high profit margin but some variation in ROE.  The extraordinarily high projected return requires further investigation and external validation. A more comprehensive analysis would require a deeper dive into the company's financials, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects.
