Okay, let's break down the analysis of Amazon (AMZN) based on the provided data.

**1) Return Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Amazon.com Inc. is a global e-commerce and cloud computing giant.
*   **AMZN Cumulative Return:** 66.25%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 102.37%
*   **Divergence:** -33.8% (Relative Divergence: 4.9)

**Analysis:** Amazon has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, with a -33.8% difference in cumulative return. The low relative divergence (4.9) suggests the current underperformance is near the lowest point compared to historical divergence ranges. This could potentially indicate an opportunity for future outperformance if the stock reverts towards its historical average relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

*   **CAGR Trend:** CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been volatile but generally decreasing. Negative CAGR in the 2020-2024 periods reflect the recent market downturn and specific company challenges.
*   **MDD Trend:** MDD (Maximum Drawdown) remains high, consistently around 80%, indicating significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha Trend:** Alpha, which measures performance relative to the market, is negative in recent periods, indicating underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Beta Trend:** Beta is increasing, signifying that Amazon's stock is becoming more sensitive to overall market movements.
*   **Cap(B) Trend:** The Market Capitalization has changed rapidly, indicating a growth and correction phase of the stock.

**Analysis:**  Amazon's historical performance shows strong growth followed by a recent period of underperformance and increased volatility. The negative alpha and high beta suggest that Amazon's returns have been lagging the market and are highly correlated with the overall market trends.
