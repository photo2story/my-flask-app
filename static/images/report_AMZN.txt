**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has shown a strong historical return significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, supported by technical indicators.  Fundamental analysis reveals healthy revenue and profit margin growth. The long-term outlook remains positive, with a projected significant outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, investors should be aware of the inherent volatility associated with AMZN's stock. Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent dip in ROE and the inconsistent EPS growth is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate data point in the earnings analysis also requires clarification.
