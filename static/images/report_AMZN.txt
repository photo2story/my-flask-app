**6. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating substantial long-term growth potential.  However, recent data suggests a short-term bearish trend. Technical indicators are mixed, with the RSI suggesting potential oversold conditions and the PPO indicating bearish momentum. The lack of comprehensive financial data limits a thorough assessment.  The high volatility, as seen in the MDD figures and beta values, should be carefully considered.  While the long-term expected return is positive, investors need to be comfortable with the inherent risk involved.  Further investigation into the missing financial data and a deeper dive into the reasons behind recent underperformance is crucial before making any investment decisions.
