**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $233.14
* **5-day Moving Average:** $235.87 (Slightly above the closing price, suggesting a recent downward trend)
* **20-day Moving Average:** $232.09 (Below the closing price, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend)
* **60-day Moving Average:** $222.47 (Significantly below the closing price, indicating a longer-term upward trend)

The recent price increase from the previous close ($229.15 to $233.14) represents a minor upward movement.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (52.88):**  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions; the stock is trading in a neutral zone.
* **PPO (-0.31):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-3.7):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative strength.


The combination of a negative PPO and negative relative divergence suggests a potential bearish trend, although the RSI is neutral.  The recent price increase is relatively small and may not significantly alter this bearish outlook in the short term. The expected return of 44.4% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a positive indicator for long-term investors.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

AMZN's long-term performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500, but recent periods have shown significant volatility. While the recent earnings show growth, short-term technical indicators suggest a potentially bearish trend. However, the long-term expected return remains positive.  Investors should consider the high volatility and significant market correlation (high beta) before investing.  Further investigation into the duplicated data entry in the earnings report is needed.  The long-term outlook, supported by strong earnings and high projected returns, may outweigh short-term bearish signals for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance.
