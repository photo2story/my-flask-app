**7. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon shows strong long-term potential based on its historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, several factors indicate near-term uncertainty.  The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, and the negative PPO confirms bearish momentum. Recent price movement shows a mixed picture, with the current price above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages but below the 5-day moving average.  While the companyâ€™s financial performance is solid, showing growth in revenue, EPS, Equity, and ROE, recent quarterly performance exhibits some downward trend.  More details regarding recent news and analyst opinions are needed to gain a complete understanding of the current market sentiment.  The high expected return should be carefully considered alongside the inherent volatility of the stock.
