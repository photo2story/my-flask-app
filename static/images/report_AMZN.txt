**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  CAGR was strong in earlier periods (2015-2019), but has become negative, and the trend is concerning. The latest period shows a small positive recovery.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha has declined significantly, even going negative in recent periods. This suggests that AMZN is underperforming relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark.
*   **Beta:**  Beta has increased over time, meaning AMZN is becoming more correlated with the market, i.e. moving more similarly with market trends.  A Beta of 1.2 in the last period means it is 20% more volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization has increased substantially, then declined.
*   **Overall:** This analysis paints a mixed picture. High MDD indicates volatility. Alpha is concerning, showing underperformance. The increase in beta means that Amazon's stock price is more closely tied to overall market movements.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 222.56
*   **Previous Close:** 222.54
*   **Change:** 0.01
*   **5-day SMA:** 226.67
*   **20-day SMA:** 227.52
*   **60-day SMA:** 227.64

**Analysis:**

*   The small change between the current and previous close suggests a relatively stable recent trading day.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating a potential short-term downtrend.  The fact that all the SMAs are quite close suggests a period of consolidation around this price level.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 37.40
*   **PPO:** -0.37
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 378.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.7 indicates a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 37.40 suggests that AMZN is approaching *oversold* conditions, which *could* lead to a potential bounce.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-0.37) suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy with all available cash, indicating a very safe investment with high MRI, suggesting a contradiction in the data.
*   **Divergence Change:** A negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days confirms a short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:**  The extraordinarily high expected return of 378.6% should be viewed with extreme skepticism. This figure is likely based on an optimistic model and past performance, which is not indicative of future results.
