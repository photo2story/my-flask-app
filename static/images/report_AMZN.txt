**6. Overall Summary:**

AMZN shows a history of high growth, but also significant volatility.  The current price is below key moving averages, and technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest oversold conditions and bearish momentum. While the financial statements indicate strong revenue and improving profitability,  the large projected future return should be treated with skepticism given the inherent risk in AMZN.  Further investigation into the drivers of the high expected return is crucial.  The inconsistent alpha and the periods of significant negative returns highlight the importance of risk management when considering an investment in AMZN.  Investors should conduct thorough due diligence and consider their individual risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated earnings data needs clarification before a comprehensive conclusion can be drawn.
