**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently high alpha values (mostly above 1), indicating that AMZN has historically outperformed the market (as measured by beta), particularly in the years 2015-2020. However, the recent years (2020-2024) show a decline in alpha, though still positive for the most recent period. Beta values fluctuate but remain relatively high, suggesting significant market sensitivity. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) demonstrates significant growth over the years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $205.74 (Last-market: $205.79)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $202.11
* **20-day Moving Average:** $203.43
* **60-day Moving Average:** $192.12

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.  The price is significantly above the 60-day moving average, showing a longer-term uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.33 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the recent relative strength is positive, the PPO is negative and the RSI is near the neutral level.  The high expected return reflects the historical performance but involves inherent risk.  The fact that the last market price ($205.79) is very close to the closing price ($205.74) indicates a lack of dramatic price movements in this period. No significant sudden up or down movements are evident.
