**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has historically outperformed the S&P 500, displaying strong revenue and EPS growth trends in recent quarters. However, the high RSI and the volatile nature of its past performance suggest caution.  The high expected return should be interpreted cautiously given the high RSI and the volatility shown in the CAGR data.
