2024-12-16 - Analysis Report
## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 261.56%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.91%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 140.7%, placing it at the 59.1st percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max range).  This suggests AMZN's performance has been substantially higher than the S&P 500 over the period considered, though the provided data doesn't specify the time frame.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in performance over time, with periods of exceptionally high growth and substantial declines.  The Alpha consistently shows near-zero values indicating that the excess return relative to the market is minimal if at all present.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $227.46
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $227.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $212.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $199.21

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downward trend. However, it sits comfortably above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a positive longer-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 84.35 - This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback is imminent.
* **PPO:** 0.57 - A positive PPO value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.9 -  Shows a short-term upward trend.

The current price of $227.46 is not exceptionally high considering the positive long term moving averages, therefore no immediate concerns about a significant rapid price change (sharp drop or spike) are indicated.  The expected return of 125.6% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a significant projection and should be considered with caution due to inherent market volatility and prediction uncertainty.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a general upward trend in both EPS and revenue, with some minor quarterly fluctuations.  However, without knowing the expected values against which performance was measured, it is impossible to determine whether any specific quarters were "beats" or "misses."  Note that the 2024-11-01 data point appears duplicated.

* **Revenue Growth:** Overall revenue growth is observable, though the growth rate varies across quarters.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS has generally increased, showing a positive trajectory.
* **Beats/Misses:** Cannot be determined from the data provided.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuations but generally displays growth, although the revenue for Q4 2023 is noticeably lower than for Q1 2024. Profit margin is relatively stable, hovering around 19%, though it experienced a dip in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024, but then rebounded.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity displays a steady increase.  ROE (Return on Equity) shows some variability, though a general upward trend is visible.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires up-to-date information from reputable financial news sources within the last two days.  I do not have access to real-time data, including news feeds or analyst opinions.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN shows strong long-term growth potential, exceeding the S&P 500 considerably over the time period represented in the data.  However, the recent RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, presenting a potential short-term risk.  The company's financial health appears sound, with growing revenue and equity, and relatively stable profit margins (despite recent fluctuations).  The projected long-term return significantly outpaces the S&P 500; however, this projection must be evaluated in context of the inherently unpredictable nature of long term stock market investments.  Further analysis requires additional market context, such as recent news, analyst ratings, and comparison to industry peers.
