## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 271.11%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.16%.  The difference is 149.0%, placing it in the 62.5th percentile of its historical relative divergence against the S&P 500.  While this indicates strong historical outperformance,  it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. The provided alpha consistently shows near zero suggesting that the outperformance isn't due to unique management decisions. However, the Beta, which measures the stock's volatility relative to the market, is consistently above 1, indicating higher volatility than the S&P 500.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures in several periods further demonstrates historical strong growth.  However, the significant negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 highlights periods of substantial underperformance.  Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) also indicate significant risk.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 43.2% –  This represents a significant outperformance expectation compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. However, this projection needs to be treated with caution due to inherent uncertainty in future market movements.  The expectation is for this outperformance to continue, not guaranteed.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500,  with high growth rates and increasing revenue and profitability.  However, significant periods of underperformance and high volatility (high Beta) are present.  Current indicators suggest a short-term overbought condition,  but long-term prospects look promising. The 43.2% expected return is substantial but highly speculative.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for significant returns against the considerable risk associated with the stock's inherent volatility.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data point is recommended.  A deeper dive into the company's specific growth drivers and competitive landscape is also necessary before making any investment decisions.
