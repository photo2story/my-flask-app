## Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 283.7%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 127.58%.  The difference is 156.12%, placing it at the 48.76th percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500 (based on a minimum divergence of -3.28% and a maximum of 323.64%). This suggests that AMZN's outperformance is notable but not exceptionally unusual compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance relative to the market over different periods.  While Alpha is generally positive, indicating outperformance, Beta fluctuates, suggesting sensitivity to market movements.  The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the years is evident.  The negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 indicates periods of underperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $197.12
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $200.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $201.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $190.67

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it's above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential longer-term support.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 51.41 – This indicates a relatively neutral market condition, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.72 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 3.24 (+) –  This indicates a short-term upward trend in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 33.27% – This is the projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500.  This is a significant projected outperformance, which needs to be considered alongside the risks involved.  The provided information does not detail the methodology used to calculate this expected return. The closing price of 197.07 doesn't trigger any significant notes on abrupt price movements.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue, although there is some fluctuation.  The latest EPS of $1.46 is higher than previous quarters, but crucial information is missing:  the *analyst estimates* for this most recent earnings report are missing and are essential for a complete analysis.  A comparison of actual results versus analyst expectations is vital to assess the market's reaction to the news.


**5. (Note:  Question 5 is missing from the original prompt.)**

**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

The provided data on revenue, profitability, equity, and ROE shows consistent revenue growth with relatively stable profit margins over the past year, though there's a slight dip in Q4 2023.  ROE (Return on Equity) shows some fluctuation but remains positive.  These figures suggest a healthy financial position, but a deeper dive into other key financial ratios (e.g., debt-to-equity ratio, current ratio) would provide a more comprehensive picture.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **(Missing):** The prompt requested analysis of recent (within the past two days) earnings news from sources like Shacknews and Finbold.  This information is needed to provide a current market outlook and analyst opinions.  Recent news regarding AMZN's performance and any significant events would be essential here.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon exhibits strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 historically. However, recent price action shows short-term weakness.  The projected long-term outperformance is significant but relies on an unspecified methodology for the expected return calculation.  Current financial data indicates solid revenue and profit, but missing analyst expectations and recent news coverage prevent a complete assessment.  Further investigation into recent news, analyst opinions, and a more comprehensive financial analysis (including debt levels and other key ratios) are crucial before making any investment decisions.
