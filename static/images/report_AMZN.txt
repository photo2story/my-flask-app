**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but this performance has been volatile.

Further research including current news, analyst ratings and economic forecasts is necessary before drawing concrete conclusions.  More complete earnings data (including expectations) would provide a more comprehensive analysis of the company's performance.
