**1) Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market, indicated by a Beta of >1), others show negative alpha or beta values near 1 indicating underperformance.  The high variability suggests significant market sensitivity and periods of both outperformance and underperformance compared to the broader market. The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over time reflects Amazon's growth.  The significant negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $216.58
* **5-day Moving Average:** $224.28
* **20-day Moving Average:** $232.40
* **60-day Moving Average:** $225.28

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price change (-$2.83) shows a short term decline.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 27.34 (Suggests oversold conditions, potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.98 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -7.4% (Indicates a recent weakening of the relative strength)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 61.4% (Significantly higher than the implied return of the S&P 500)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish sentiment. The negative change in relative divergence further reinforces the short-term bearish trend. However, the high expected return suggests a potentially attractive long-term investment opportunity, relative to the S&P 500.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Amazon shows a history of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, although this performance has been volatile. Recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, supported by technical indicators. However, strong financial fundamentals and a high projected long-term return suggest potential for significant growth in the coming years.  Further investigation into the causes of the significant negative CAGR periods (2020-2022 & 2021-2023) is recommended.  Clarification on the duplicate earnings data entry is also needed for a more comprehensive analysis. The discrepancy between short-term bearish signals and long-term positive projections highlights the importance of considering both short-term price fluctuations and long-term growth potential when making investment decisions.
