* **Closing Price:** $207.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $204.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $204.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $192.62

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, it is considerably above the 60-day moving average, indicating a stronger upward trend in the shorter-term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 49.69 – This is near the neutral level (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** -0.23 – This negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** NaN (-) –  The absence of data prevents analysis.  However the description states the short-term trend is down. The closing price of $207.91 is higher than the moving averages, hence it isn't a significant issue. A spike in price isn't reflected, despite the data showing otherwise, hence further investigation is required to determine whether or not there is a trend.
* **Expected Return:** 220.6% – This represents a significant potential upside compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with continued investment.  However, this figure is provided with little context and needs further supporting information.
