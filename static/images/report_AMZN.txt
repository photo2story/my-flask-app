## Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 257.72%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.40%.  The difference is 137.3 percentage points.  This places AMZN at the 57.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided range.  The provided alpha values are consistently near zero, suggesting the outperformance isn't consistently explained by factors beyond market movements.  Beta values show high volatility relative to the S&P 500.  The significant negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 highlights periods of significant underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $225.04
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $223.37
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $210.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $197.15

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates a recent stable price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.41 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.77 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +7.6% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 127.4% (Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 projected)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to a short-term correction. However, the positive PPO and upward relative divergence indicate continued upward momentum in the short term.  The closing price of 225.15 is slightly above the reported closing price and is not indicative of a significant, sudden price movement. The expected return is substantial, but inherently involves significant uncertainty related to future market conditions and AMZN's performance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN shows strong long-term growth potential but also demonstrates considerable volatility.  While the recent performance against the S&P 500 is remarkable, historical data reveals periods of substantial underperformance. The recent earnings show increasing revenue and EPS, but the consistency needs further observation.  Technical indicators suggest potential for short-term correction despite current upward momentum. The high expected return is appealing, but investors should be aware of the inherent risk associated with such high growth projections, particularly given the cyclical nature of AMZN's performance and the uncertainty of future market conditions. Further investigation into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a complete assessment.
