**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent performance has been weaker. While the long-term outlook (267.1% expected return) is positive, it's crucial to note the high level of uncertainty associated with such long-term predictions.  The current market price is below key moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. Technical indicators (RSI, PPO) are mixed but leaning bearish.  Fundamental analysis shows growth in revenue and equity, but further investigation is needed.  Investors should carefully consider the risks associated with investing in AMZN, particularly given its recent volatility.  The duplicated earnings data requires clarification.  More comprehensive data and analysis are necessary for a complete and reliable assessment.
