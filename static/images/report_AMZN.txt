**6) Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has shown strong long-term growth but experienced significant volatility in recent years.  The current price is below its moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. While the RSI indicates oversold conditions,  the PPO shows weak bullish momentum.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return needs further justification and should be considered with caution.  Fundamental analysis shows consistent revenue growth and generally positive profitability, but EPS growth is less stable.  Overall, further investigation into the drivers of recent volatility and a comprehensive risk assessment are crucial before making investment decisions.  The provided data alone does not offer a definitive buy or sell recommendation.
