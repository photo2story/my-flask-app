## Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 300.46%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%.  The difference is 171.6%, placing it at the 53.5th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data (max divergence 323.6%, min -3.3%). This indicates AMZN has historically outperformed VOO, but the current divergence is moderate compared to its historical range.

The Alpha and Beta analysis show varying results across different periods.  While Alpha (excess return compared to the market) was consistently high between 2015 and 2021 (ranging from 1.3 to 2.3), indicating significant outperformance, it became negative in 2020-2022, before recovering in 2022-2024. The Beta consistently remains above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market.  However, the recent years show some volatility and lower Alpha, suggesting the outperformance might not be as consistent as it was in previous years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $205.74 (Last Market: $205.79)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $202.11
* **20-day Moving Average:** $203.43
* **60-day Moving Average:** $192.12

The price is currently trading above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day MA indicates a less pronounced upward trend. The significant gap between the 60-day MA and the current price reflects a stronger recent price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.33 -  Approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce but not necessarily a strong uptrend.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.36 - Negative value indicates bearish momentum.

The recent relative divergence is slightly positive (+5.1%), indicating short-term upward momentum.  The last market price of $205.79 is very close to the closing price, indicating no significant price jumps or drops within the reporting period.  The expected return of 223.7% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant projection that needs further analysis to justify.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024.  However, it's important to note the apparent duplication of the October 27th, 2023 data point in the provided table, requiring clarification to accurately assess the financial trends.  An analysis of the full-year results and analyst expectations is needed to provide a comprehensive outlook.  The data also lacks the expected EPS alongside the last reported EPS, hindering a more thorough analysis.

**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue and Profitability show consistent revenue growth, with profit margins fluctuating around 19%. Capital and Profitability data shows growth in Equity, while ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, possibly reflecting increased investments or shifts in the company's financial strategies.  Further investigation into the reasons for ROE fluctuation is needed for a complete understanding.

The short-term trend appears positive based on moving averages, but technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish momentum.  Further investigation into the duplicated financial data and a thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions is necessary to draw a comprehensive conclusion about the stock's current position and future potential.  The projected long-term return requires a careful review to assess its feasibility.
