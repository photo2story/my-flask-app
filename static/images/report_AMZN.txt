## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 313.02%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 129.75%.  The difference is 183.27%, placing it at the 57.1st percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 based on the provided data. This indicates strong historical outperformance, though past performance is not indicative of future results.  The provided Alpha values consistently show positive outperformance relative to the market, while the Beta suggests higher volatility than the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $213.44
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $209.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $206.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $193.91

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The last market price of $217.54 indicates a recent upward movement.  It's important to note, however, that this is only a short-term observation and doesn't predict future price movements.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.67 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.10 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** NaN (-), indicating a recent short-term downward trend. This contradicts the observation from the moving averages.  Further investigation is needed to resolve this discrepancy.
* **Expected Return:** 211.2% This is likely the expected return compared to the S&P 500 over a longer term (2+ years) of consistent investment. However, the metric lacks context; the base for the calculation isn't clear.  This claim requires further validation. The last market price exceeding 217.54 points to a recent sharp upswing, potentially driven by market sentiment or news events.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a general upward trend in both revenue and EPS, although there are some fluctuations.  While revenue shows a generally positive trend, EPS shows volatility with a dip in Q4 2023. No comparison to earnings expectations is provided so it's impossible to determine whether earnings "beat" or "missed" expectations.  The data also seems to contain duplicate entries.

|------------|------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 2024-11-01 | 1.46 | 158.88        |                 |             |

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Both Revenue and Profit Margin show some fluctuations, but generally remained stable over the given period, with a slight upward trend in Revenue during 2024's first three quarters. The notable drop in the last quarter of 2023 needs further analysis to determine its cause.  Equity and ROE have shown consistent growth during this period, indicating a healthy financial position.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information not provided.  No recent earnings news, market outlook or analyst opinions are included in the provided data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon shows a strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, indicated by high cumulative returns and a consistently positive alpha. Recent price action suggests a potential upward trend, supported by the moving averages, although the short-term relative strength change contradicts this.  Earnings show a generally positive trend in revenue but some volatility in EPS. Financial health appears stable. However, a crucial piece of information is missing: the context behind the reported numbers.  Determining whether or not AMZN is currently overvalued requires the missing market context (e.g., earnings expectations, analyst ratings, market sentiment) and a deeper dive into the business fundamentals.  The provided data alone is not sufficient to make a comprehensive investment recommendation.
