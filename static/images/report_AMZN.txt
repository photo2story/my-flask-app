The cumulative return of AMZN is 298.27%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 125.6%. The difference is 172.67%, placing it at the 53.82nd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (max: 323.64%, min: -3.28%).

Beta consistently remains above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market.

* **Closing Price:** $204.61
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $206.9
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $199.3
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $189.3

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term bearish trend. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term uptrend.  The price is relatively close to its 20-day moving average, suggesting some consolidation may be occurring.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.89 (Neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.1 (Slightly negative, indicating weak momentum)

The price of $204.61 does not suggest a drastic recent price movement (no sharp spike or drop is implied by the provided data).  The positive 20-day relative divergence supports the idea of short-term upward trend despite slightly negative PPO. The high expected return indicates potential for significant outperformance over the long term.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue.  While there are minor fluctuations quarter-to-quarter, the overall trend points to growth.  To properly assess the most recent earnings (2024-11-01), a comparison with analyst expectations is crucial â€“ this information is missing from the provided data.  Without the analyst expectations, a complete assessment of the most recent earnings report cannot be performed.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

The revenue and profitability data show consistent revenue growth, although profit margins experienced a slight dip in Q4 2023 before recovering.  ROE has shown some fluctuation, but generally remains above 5%, indicating a reasonable return on equity.


**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **News Sources:**  To complete this section, analysis of recent news from sources like Shacknews and Finbold is needed.  This would include any recent earnings reports (specifically including analyst expectations for comparison), market outlook reports, and analyst opinions on the stock's performance.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon (AMZN) demonstrates a history of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, though this outperformance has been less consistent in recent years. Current technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook.  The company's financial performance shows overall growth, although a complete evaluation of the most recent earnings requires comparison to analyst expectations. The high expected return of 18.88% over the long-term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500, combined with the relatively strong financial performance, makes it a potentially attractive investment for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance due to its inherent volatility. However, a deeper dive into recent news and analyst sentiment is critical for a more conclusive assessment.
