**7. Overall Analysis:**

AMZN has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent price action and indicators show some caution, the overall financial health and earnings suggest continued potential.  However, the high beta indicates significant market risk. The projected high long-term expected return is promising but relies on several assumptions and should be viewed cautiously.  Further due diligence, including a thorough risk assessment, is necessary before making any investment decisions. The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) require further clarification.
