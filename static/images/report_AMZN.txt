The recent small price increase shouldn't be over interpreted as a significant change in trend.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Amazon exhibits a history of high growth and significant volatility. While the provided data suggests strong long-term potential based on the long-term expected return and recent financial performance, the current technical indicators hint at a bearish short-term outlook.  Further investigation into the methodologies used to calculate the expected return and the resolution of data inconsistencies is essential.  The high market risk indicator necessitates caution.  Before making any investment decision, a comprehensive analysis of future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and potential risks should be undertaken.  The historical data suggests strong performance compared to the S&P 500, but past performance is not indicative of future results.
