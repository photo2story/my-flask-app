## Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Amazon.com Inc. is a multinational technology company which focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return of AMZN is 257.75%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.56%.  The difference is 140.2%, placing it at the 58.9th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (based on a min/max range normalized to 100).  While significantly outperforming the benchmark, this relative outperformance is not necessarily an indicator of future performance.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for AMZN across multiple periods, reaching as high as 120% (2018-2020).  However, the significant negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 highlights substantial volatility.  Alpha consistently shows near zero, suggesting performance largely aligned with market movements (beta is high, ranging from 0.0 to 626.0, indicating high market sensitivity), with the exception of the periods of high outperformance.  Market capitalization has steadily increased over time.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $225.06
* **Last Market Price:** $229.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $224.99
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $220.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $202.65

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent positive momentum.  The price is significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a stronger upward trend over the longer term.  The difference between the last market price and closing price ($229.05 vs. $225.06) is small and doesn't signal a significant immediate price movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 62.62 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.40 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.3% (Slight downward trend in relative performance)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 128.7% (Significant potential outperformance of S&P 500 over the long term)

The relatively low negative PPO, coupled with a slightly elevated RSI and only a minor negative relative divergence, presents a mixed signal. While the long-term expected return is substantial, the short-term indicators show some weakness.  The higher last market price ($229.05) compared to the closing price doesn't signal any major sudden changes.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The reported EPS has shown a general upward trend, growing from $0.96 in Q4 2023 to $1.46 in Q4 2024.  Revenue also demonstrates growth, increasing from $143.08B in Q4 2023 to $158.88B in Q4 2024. Note that there is a duplicate entry for Q4 2024.  Without further information, it's impossible to determine if these figures beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue shows significant quarterly fluctuations, with a notable peak in Q4 2023. Profit margins are consistently above 17%, indicating strong profitability.
* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity has been steadily increasing, and ROE (Return on Equity) shows fluctuation, though generally high.

The financial data indicates a generally healthy financial state for Amazon, characterized by high revenue and profit margins, although some quarterly fluctuations are present.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Amazon (AMZN) demonstrates a strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the past periods. However, its performance is highly volatile, as indicated by large swings in CAGR.  While recent earnings show positive growth, short-term technical indicators present a somewhat mixed signal.  The long-term expected return remains high, suggesting that a long-term investment strategy might be favorable, but investors should be aware of the inherent volatility.  Further analysis incorporating up-to-date news, analyst opinions, and a deeper dive into the reasons behind the fluctuations in CAGR and the missing Q4 2024 data point is crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.
