The negative Beta values in recent periods suggest an inverse correlation with the market.  The declining market capitalization is concerning.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** \$3.29
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: \$3.36, Previous Close: \$3.29, Change: 2.13%

    *   5-day: \$3.28
    *   20-day: \$3.20
    *   60-day: \$3.30

*   **Analysis:** The stock price has shown a slight increase in the last market session. The 5-day moving average is slightly above the 20-day average, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the 60-day average is higher than both, indicating that the stock may still be in a longer-term downtrend. The recent price increase suggests a potential short-term positive move, but more confirmation is needed to ascertain a trend reversal.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3367 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 65.00 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.81 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.33)
*   **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (Neutral)
*   **Expected Return:** -10377.3%

*   **Analysis:**  The MRI suggests a low-risk environment, however, this reading should be taken with caution given the high volatility of the stock.  The RSI is approaching overbought levels, suggesting a potential pullback. The PPO is positive, indicating short-term upward momentum. The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a buying opportunity, but this should be considered in light of the high expected return of -10377.3%. A sharp price increase in the last market session (2.13%) might reflect a temporary market reaction. The negative expected return should be carefully considered.
