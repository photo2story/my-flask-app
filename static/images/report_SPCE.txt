    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows significant negative returns in recent periods, highlighting poor long-term performance.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown consistently exceeds 74%, indicating substantial risk and volatility.  Investors have experienced large losses from peak to trough.
    *   **Alpha:** The consistently negative Alpha suggests SPCE has significantly underperformed its benchmark (risk-adjusted return).
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values close to zero suggest low correlation with the broader market (S&P 500). In other words, SPCE's price movements are largely independent of the overall market trends. This could be because the firm's value and stock price depends on so much more than the market.
    *   **Cap(B):** The declining capitalization underscores the reduction in the company's market value over time.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 3.87

*   **5-day SMA:** 3.564
*   **20-day SMA:** 3.5855
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.7224

    *   The current close is above all three Simple Moving Averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend.  The 4.59% change indicates recent positive momentum.
    *   However, caution is warranted as the longer-term SMAs (20-day, 60-day) are still higher than the 5-day SMA, suggesting the long term movement is negative.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 58.97
*   **PPO:** 0.8539

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -7207.2

    *   The MRI of 0.9 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   The RSI of 58.97 is near the overbought level of 70, but not above, indicating increasing buying pressure, but not extreme.
    *   The positive PPO value indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which is a bullish sign.
    *   The Hybrid Signal suggests to buy, however, the Expected Return is dramatically negative, suggesting that long-term investments have the risk of significant long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if invested at this point.
    *   The positive change in relative divergence over the past 20 days, coupled with the Hybrid Signal, suggests a potential short-term bullish trend, although be wary of large fluctuations.
