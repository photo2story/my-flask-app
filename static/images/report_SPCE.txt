**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR is negative for most periods, highlighting the stock's poor performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD is very high in the initial years of the study (90-99%), indicating significant potential losses for investors who bought and held the stock. MDD is 0% for the last two entries (2022-2024 and 2023-2025)
*   **Alpha:** The negative Alpha across all periods suggests that SPCE has underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.  It's consistently lower than 0, indicating negative alpha generation.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is consistently above 1, indicating that SPCE is more volatile than the market. The increasing Beta from 2018 to 2024 suggests increasing volatility over time.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has decreased significantly between 2018 and 2025, indicating investor confidence is low and capital is being removed from the business.

*   **Change:** -2.73%
*   **5-day SMA:** 3.232
*   **20-day SMA:** 3.5685
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.7473

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which can be interpreted as a short-term downtrend. The negative change from the previous close further supports this observation.

*   **RSI:** 40.89
*   **PPO:** -0.76

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.5 (+) Short-term rise
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0%

**Analysis:**

*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal is suggesting that the stock is worth buying.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** the short-term rise is inconsistent with other information.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 0.0% suggests analysts do not expect this stock to appreciate.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data presents a very bearish outlook for Virgin Galactic. While the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, this seems to be an outlier inconsistent with all other indicators.
