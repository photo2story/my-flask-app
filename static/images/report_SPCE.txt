**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $6.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $6.95
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $6.59

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend. However, it's above its 60-day moving average, indicating some support.  The relatively close proximity of the moving averages suggests some price consolidation.  The slight difference between the last market price (6.76) and the closing price (6.77) is negligible and doesn't indicate any significant price jump or drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (41.23):** Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a short-term bounce.
* **PPO (-0.44):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** 0.73 (+), indicating a short-term upward trend.

The combination of these indicators paints a mixed picture. While RSI hints at potential short-term recovery, PPO signals bearish momentum.  The positive relative divergence is consistent with a short-term bounce but should be viewed cautiously in the context of the long-term underperformance.  The expected return of 0.0% indicates that at this point,  a long-term (2+ years) investment through dollar-cost averaging would likely only achieve the market return of the S&P 500,  not exceeding it given the present outlook.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data shows consistently negative EPS and zero revenue across the reported quarters.  This reflects the company's ongoing struggles to generate profitability and significant revenue, consistent with its stage as a developing space tourism company that has yet to achieve substantial scale.  The absence of an earnings estimate for the most recent quarter prevents a direct comparison. The negative EPS figures suggest substantial losses, and zero revenue highlights the company's dependence on future spaceflight operations for revenue generation.

**5.  Financial Information:**

The quarterly financial data reveals significant losses (negative profit margins) and a declining return on equity (ROE).  The consistent near-zero revenue emphasizes the operational challenges and the company's heavy reliance on future commercial spaceflights to turn profitable. These financial indicators underscore the high risk associated with SPCE as an investment.
