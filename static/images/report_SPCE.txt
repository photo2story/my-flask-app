*   **Hybrid Signal:** A signal to buy 100% of cash suggests a possible bullish outlook based on a blend of indicators.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term improvement compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return indicates very poor long-term investment prospects.

**Impact of Price Change:** The 10.88% price increase from the previous close could be seen as a sharp rebound, but it's crucial to determine if this is a sustainable trend or a temporary fluctuation. This needs to be considered in light of the fundamental analysis.
