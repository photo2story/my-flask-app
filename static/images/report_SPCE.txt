**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR Trend:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has been sharply declining and negative in recent years, indicating poor investment returns over these periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values across all periods signify significant potential losses for investors who bought at peak prices within those timeframes.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha figures reveal that SPCE has underperformed its benchmark (market) on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to zero suggest that SPCE's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market. In recent years, the negative beta indicates a slight inverse correlation.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization):** Market cap has decreased significantly, reflecting a decline in investor confidence and company valuation.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy, though it should be taken cautiously considering the overall analysis.
