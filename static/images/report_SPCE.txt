Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) based on the provided data, broken down into sections as requested.

**1) Return Rate Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **SPCE:** Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc is a spaceflight company focused on suborbital spaceflight for private individuals and researchers.
*   **SPCE Cumulative Return:** -79.92%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 76.27%
*   **Divergence:** -153.6 (Relative Divergence: 1.0)

**Analysis:** SPCE has drastically underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The negative cumulative return indicates a significant loss of investment value over the tracked period.  The divergence of -153.6, with a relative divergence of 1.0, suggests the underperformance is at its worst point within the observed historical range. It has diverged far more than its peers. The high negative divergence is primarily caused by the high return of the S\&P500, rather than the low return of the stock itself.

*   **5-day SMA:** 3.242
*   **20-day SMA:** 3.3035
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.674

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). The SMAs themselves are trending downwards (60-day > 20-day > 5-day), which is a bearish signal. The 0.95% change in the last market price indicates very little fluctuation.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 48.24 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.23 (Slightly bearish, suggesting a slight downward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (262 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** 1.0 (+), indicates a short-term rise.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10027.0%. This is an extremely negative figure, suggesting that the model projects massive losses if a long-term investment is made at this point.

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" rating, though this should be considered in light of other factors.
*   The RSI is neutral, not providing a strong buy or sell signal.
*   The PPO suggests a slightly bearish trend, but it's a weak signal.
*   The recent short-term rise is contradicted by the high negative expected return, signifying that while the stock may go up briefly, long-term prospects for the stock are terrible.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Prediction:**  "Why Virgin Galactic Stock Is Set to Go to $0" - This is a very concerning headline suggesting a potential complete loss of investment.
