| 2023-2025  | -31.0%    | 82.0%    | -97.0%   | -0.2   | 0.2    |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate demonstrates a severe decline in recent periods. Negative values indicate substantial losses.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown shows a consistently high level of risk, with drawdowns exceeding 70% in most periods.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha consistently becomes more negative, implying SPCE is significantly underperforming its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta remains close to zero, which is not realistic, which may imply that Beta is not a meaningful statistic for this stock.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization is decreasing over time.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 3.5
*   **Last-Market:** Price 3.7, Previous Close 3.5, Change 5.71%
*   **5-day SMA:** 3.222
*   **20-day SMA:** 3.6762
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.8164

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is showing a recent small upward trend (price increased from 3.5 to 3.7), with the 5-day SMA below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a potential short-term positive movement, but needs to be watched closely, as the most recent change (5.71%) suggests fluctuation.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 42.22
*   **PPO:** -1.68
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (253 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00)"
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 0.4 (+) indicates a short-term increase in relative divergence, signaling a short-term price increase.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10472.2%

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests "Medium Investment," which seems contradictory considering the other indicators. The RSI of 42.22 isn't oversold or overbought. A negative PPO means the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average. "Hybrid Signal" recommends buying. However, the Expected Return is disastrously negative, indicating extreme caution. The recent price change of 5.71% needs to be considered in light of the high volatility and unreliability of the stock's metrics.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Headlines:**
    *   "Space stocks rocket higher as sector optimism gains steam into 2026" - *CNBC*
    *   "This Space Stock Extends Its Recent Rally After a Successful Launch, Space Force Contract" - *Investopedia*
*   **Negative Headlines:**
    *   "RKLB, ASTS, TDG: Insiders are Selling These 3 Space Stocks" - *MarketBeat*

    *   "Why Did Sidus Space Stock Rocket 75% Today?" - *Stocktwits* (Note: Focus is on Sidus Space, not SPCE directly)

*   **Analysis:** The news is mixed. There's sector-wide optimism and news of a successful launch and contract. However, insider selling is a red flag. Debt restructuring and analyst targets suggest a long road to recovery.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 2.88)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 4.12, High: 8.00, Low: 2.00
*   **Analysis:** Analyst consensus is a "Hold," suggesting uncertainty. The wide range in target prices (2.00 to 8.00) indicates significant disagreement and risk associated with the stock. The lack of recent rating changes could imply stagnation.

| 2024-09-30   | $0.37B  | -20.37%  |

*   **Analysis:**  The lack of revenue and extremely negative profit margins confirm severe financial difficulties. Equity is decreasing, and the negative Return on Equity (ROE) indicates the company is not effectively using its equity to generate profits.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Based on the data, Virgin Galactic (SPCE) presents a very high-risk investment. Here's a summary:

*   **Underperformance:** It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Financials:**  Zero revenue, massive losses, and a declining equity base paint a dire picture.
*   **Technical Indicators:**  Mixed signals; the "Hybrid Signal" contradicts the extremely negative expected return.
*   **News:** Mixed, with positive sentiment in the space sector offset by negative news like insider selling.
*   **Analyst Opinion:** Neutral "Hold" rating but with a very wide target price range.
*   **Volatility:** Recent price changes suggest fluctuations

**Conclusion:** While there may be some short-term speculative opportunities due to news and sector enthusiasm, the underlying financial health of the company is weak. The negative expected return and poor financials suggest that a long-term investment in SPCE is extremely risky and would only be suitable for investors with a very high-risk tolerance. Caution is advised.
