* **20-Day Moving Average:** $6.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $6.58

The stock price is currently trading slightly below its short-term moving averages, suggesting potential downward pressure. However, it's above its 60-day average, which could be interpreted as a moderately positive sign.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.2 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.31 (Negative; suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** 0.44 (+) (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates that at the current juncture, long-term (2+ years) investment with regular contributions is not expected to significantly outperform the S&P 500.  This should be considered in context with the significant underperformance already observed.)

The current price of $6.81 doesn't significantly deviate from recent averages, so a dramatic price swing (sharp increase or decrease) is not immediately indicated.  However, given the negative PPO and the historically poor performance relative to the S&P 500, caution is warranted.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows consistent net losses (negative EPS) and zero revenue across multiple reporting periods.  The most recent earnings reports ($0.00B in revenue and -$5.57 EPS on 2024-11-06) reveal continued operational challenges and the absence of significant revenue generation. There is no information about earnings estimates to compare to the reported earnings, hindering a complete assessment. This pattern points towards a need for significant revenue growth and cost control to achieve profitability.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data shows alarmingly negative profit margins and a consistently negative return on equity (ROE). This highlights a severe lack of profitability and indicates significant challenges in generating returns on invested capital. The persistently high negative margins are particularly concerning and suggest a pressing need for strategic adjustments.  The zero revenue figures consistently across multiple quarters underscore the urgency of generating substantial income.

**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the extreme underperformance against the market, the lack of profitability, and the persistent operational challenges, investing in SPCE requires a high risk tolerance and a long-term outlook.  Investors should carefully consider the substantial financial risks before making any investment decisions.  A thorough due diligence process is crucial, including researching any recent developments and the company's plans for future revenue generation and profitability.

Without evidence of a substantial turnaround in the company's financial performance and business model, investing in SPCE should be approached with extreme caution.
