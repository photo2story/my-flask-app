**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** SPCE
*   **Company Overview:** Virgin Galactic is a spaceflight company focused on suborbital space tourism.
*   **SPCE Cumulative Return:** -78.60%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 81.96%

| 2023-2025  | -31.0%    | 82.0% | -97.0%  | -0.2 | 0.2    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows a dramatic decline from positive to heavily negative values over the periods examined.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Consistently high MDD values indicate very significant potential losses for investors during these periods.  The stock experiences large declines from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** The consistently negative Alpha suggests the stock significantly underperforms its expected return based on its risk (Beta). It means the stock is not generating excess returns.
*   **Beta:** Beta hovers around zero, but is decreasing, suggesting the stock has a very low correlation with the overall market (S&P 500). It is likely to be more affected by the internal conditions of the company, rather than the market in general.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** The market capitalization has decreased significantly, indicating a decline in investor confidence.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 3.5
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 3.5, 'previousClose': 3.28, 'change': 6.71}
*   **5-day SMA:** 3.222
*   **20-day SMA:** 3.6762
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.8164

**Analysis:** The stock price closed at 3.5, with a significant increase from the previous close (6.71% change). The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend following a longer period of decline or consolidation.

**3) RSI, PPO and Other Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 42.22
*   **PPO:** -1.68
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (253 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10472.2%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A Medium Investment indicates moderate risk relative to overall market conditions, but it is important to consider it in conjunction with other indicators.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 42.22 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a possible downtrend, although the value is small.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This suggests to buy the stock.
*   **Recent relative divergence change:** Suggests a short-term upward trend, confirming the analysis in section 2.
*   **Expected Return:** The highly negative expected return is concerning and suggests extremely poor long-term prospects based on the model.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **SpaceX Loses Starlink Satellite:** This is news about a competitor, not directly related to SPCE, but affects the space travel sector.

**Analysis:**  The news headlines paint a mixed picture. There are articles discussing potential catalysts (Delta Flights), but also articles discussing stock crashes, and negative predictions. Analyst opinions and target prices appear frequently, suggesting high volatility and uncertainty surrounding the stock.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 2.88)
*   **Target Price:** 4.12 (avg) / 8.00 (high) / 2.00 (low)

**Analysis:** The overall analyst consensus is "Hold." However, the wide range of target prices (2.00 to 8.00) indicates a significant disagreement among analysts about the stock's potential.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출   |
|------------|--------|--------|
| 2025-11-13 | -1.09  | 0.00 B$|
| 2025-08-06 | -1.47  | 0.00 B$|
| 2025-05-15 | -2.38  | 0.00 B$|
| 2024-11-06 | -2.66  | 0.00 B$|
| 2025-11-13 | -2.66  | 0.00 B$|

**Analysis:**  Virgin Galactic is consistently reporting negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) and zero revenue. This highlights fundamental issues with profitability. The duplication of the EPS and revenue data for November 13, 2025, might be an error. However, even without the duplicate, the trend is consistent: significant losses and no revenue.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.00B  | -5241.64%     |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.00B  | -3399.01%     |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.00B  | -4417.57%     |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.00B  | -4625.17%     |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.00B  | -4843.78%     |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity | ROE      |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.23B | -28.52%  |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.26B | -25.55%  |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.27B | -31.04%  |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.32B | -23.71%  |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.37B | -20.37%  |

**Analysis:**  The financial data reinforces the concerns raised by the earnings analysis. Revenue is consistently zero, and profit margins are extremely negative. Equity is decreasing over time, and Return on Equity (ROE) is significantly negative. This shows a serious financial distress.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Virgin Galactic (SPCE) presents a high-risk investment profile based on the data provided:

*   **Poor Performance:**  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Financials:**  Consistently negative earnings, no revenue, and decreasing equity highlight serious financial challenges.
*   **High Risk:**  The high MDD values and negative expected return indicate a very risky investment.
*   **Mixed News:**  While there's some positive news about future services (Delta Flights), there are also reports of stock crashes and concerns about debt.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Analyst consensus is a "Hold," but target prices vary widely, reflecting uncertainty.
*   **Short-Term Rebound:** A recent short-term upward trend is indicated by the SMAs and divergence change, but this appears to be a small bounce within a larger downtrend.

**Overall Recommendation:**  The data suggests that Virgin Galactic is a very risky investment. While a short-term rebound is possible, the fundamental financial issues and negative long-term outlook make it unsuitable for risk-averse investors. A "Hold" rating seems appropriate for current investors, but potential new investors should exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence. Investing should only be considered by investors with a very high-risk tolerance and a deep understanding of the space tourism industry. The company needs to demonstrate a clear path to profitability to justify a more positive outlook.
