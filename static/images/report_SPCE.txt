**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| 2017-2019  | 15.0%    | 23.0%    | 1.0%     | 0.0    | 13.4   |
| 2018-2020  | 66.0%    | 74.7%    | 42.0%    | 0.0    | 27.5   |
| 2019-2021  | -8.0%    | 74.7%    | -54.0%   | 0.0    | 15.5   |
| 2020-2022  | -133.0%  | 76.1%    | -133.0%  | 0.0    | 4.0    |
| 2021-2023  | -218.0%  | 81.0%    | -220.0%  | -0.0   | 2.8    |
| 2022-2024  | -52.0%   | 81.0%    | -72.0%   | -0.1   | 0.3    |
| 2023-2025  | -30.0%   | 82.0%    | -94.0%   | -0.2   | 0.2    |

**Interpretation:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compounded Annual Growth Rate demonstrates a significant decline in recent years. The company's high growth in the early periods (2018-2020) has been followed by increasingly negative growth rates, culminating in substantial losses in more recent periods.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown values are consistently high across all periods, indicating substantial risk and volatility associated with the investment. Investors could experience significant losses from peak to trough during these periods.
*   **Alpha:** The alpha values show that the company has significantly underperformed relative to its benchmark, especially in later years. The negative alpha suggests the stock is not generating excess returns relative to the risk-free rate, which is a major concern.
*   **Beta:** The beta values are near zero or negative, indicating that the stock is relatively uncorrelated with the overall market. This could be either an advantage or a disadvantage, depending on the market conditions, but it certainly diminishes the stock's capacity to benefit from broader market trends.
*   **Cap:** The company's market capitalization has decreased significantly over the periods, reflecting decreased investor confidence and reduced investment.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** 3.94
*   **Last Market Data:** Price = 3.97, Previous Close = 3.72, Change = 6.72%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 4.238
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 4.0491
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 3.5338

**Analysis:**

The stock price has recently experienced a jump (+6.72% compared to the previous close). However, the current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but above the 60-day moving average.  This suggests a potential short-term upward trend following a longer period of relative weakness.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Outlook

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 52.04 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -1.06 (Slightly Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" (259 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.8 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -6971.2% (Long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   Despite the recent price increase, the MRI indicates a High Investment Recommended.
*   The RSI is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   The PPO is slightly negative, suggesting the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, a slightly bearish signal.
*   The negative change in relative divergence points to recent underperformance.
*   **The very low Expected Return suggests that SPCE is expected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 in the long term.**

The absence of recent rating changes further underscores the lack of strong conviction among analysts.

### 5. Recent Earnings Analysis:

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue |
| ---------- | ----- | ------- |
| 2025-08-06 | -1.47 | 0.00 B$ |
| 2025-05-15 | -2.38 | 0.00 B$ |
| 2024-11-06 | -2.66 | 0.00 B$ |
| 2024-08-07 | -4.36 | 0.00 B$ |
| 2025-08-06 | -4.36 | 0.00 B$ |

**Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals consistent losses per share (EPS) and zero revenue. This is a significant red flag, indicating that the company is not generating any sales while incurring substantial losses. The continuous absence of revenue raises serious questions about the company's long-term viability and business model.

### 6. Financial Information:

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2024-06-30 | $0.39B  | -23.75%   |

**Analysis:**

*   The financial data shows zero revenue across all reported quarters, which confirms the earlier earnings analysis.
*   The profit margins are extremely negative, indicating that the company is spending significantly more than it is earning. These margins are unsustainable in the long term.
*   The Equity is decreasing over time, indicating a decline in the company's net assets.
*   The Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, reflecting the company's inability to generate profits from shareholders' equity.

### 7. Overall Analysis:

Virgin Galactic (SPCE) presents a highly risky investment opportunity.  It has severely underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial negative divergence.  The company faces significant financial challenges:

*   **Lack of Revenue:**  The most critical concern is the consistent absence of revenue.
*   **High Losses:**  Large negative EPS and unsustainable profit margins.
*   **Declining Equity:** Eroding financial position.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:**  Neutral "Hold" rating with a wide target price range.
*   **Negative Outlook:**  Extremely low expected return compared to the S&P 500.

While the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, this seems to be at odds with the company's financial realities and negative performance indicators. The recent jump in stock price may be a temporary anomaly and should be viewed with caution.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, a conservative investor should avoid SPCE. The risks significantly outweigh the potential rewards. Any investment should be considered highly speculative and represent only a small portion of a diversified portfolio, with careful monitoring. It would be wise to wait for tangible signs of revenue generation and improved financial performance before considering a long-term investment.
