**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 3.6776
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 4.04, Previous Close: 3.84, Change: 5.21%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 3.6151
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 3.3208
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 3.3728

**Analysis:** The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The significant positive change in the last market data (+5.21%) indicates a recent surge in price, potentially driven by news or market sentiment.

**3. Indicators and Signals**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 68.08
*   **PPO:** 1.26
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% (322 shares - Very Safe - MRI: 0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.6 (+) (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -9701.2%

**Analysis:** The RSI is approaching overbought territory (above 70). The PPO being positive suggests that short-term momentum is stronger than long-term momentum. The hybrid signal recommends a full buy based on the current MRI. The recent increase in relative divergence supports the short-term upward trend suggested by the price action. However, the extraordinarily low expected return raises significant concerns about long-term investment potential.

While there might be short-term trading opportunities based on the recent price surge and technical indicators, the fundamental financial health of Virgin Galactic is concerning. The company's inability to generate revenue and its consistent losses raise serious questions about its long-term viability. Investment in SPCE should be considered highly speculative and approached with extreme caution. A full and proper risk analysis would be recommended before considering any investments.
