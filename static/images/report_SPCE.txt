**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is negative for recent periods, indicating significant losses.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is very high, consistently around 80-90%, reflecting substantial peak-to-trough declines in value.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is consistently negative, indicating underperformance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500).  SPCE is not generating excess returns.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is above 1, meaning SPCE is more volatile than the S&P 500.  It amplifies market movements (both up and down).  The trend suggests increasing volatility over time (Beta increasing).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has decreased significantly

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 3.29
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 3.35, 'previousClose': 3.25, 'change': 3.08}
*   **5-day SMA:** 3.22
*   **20-day SMA:** 3.52
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.74

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), which is generally considered a bearish signal. The very recent price increase (3.08% change in last market) might indicate a short-term rebound, but the longer-term trend is still downward.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 43.75
*   **PPO:** -0.51
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (262 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 1.0 (+) 단기상승 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -10027.0%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A Market Risk Indicator of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation. However, this must be taken with a grain of salt considering the other negative indicators.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 43.75 is neutral.  It's not overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30).
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-0.51) suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests buying, but this signal appears to be contradicted by much of the other data.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent positive change in relative divergence *could* signal a short-term upward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-10027.0%) is a major red flag, suggesting very high risk and potential for further losses. This figure suggests the model anticipates a very negative outcome compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Debt Restructuring:**  Virgin Galactic restructured its debt (The Motley Fool). This is often viewed negatively initially, as it can indicate financial struggles.
*   **Valuation Concerns:**  Assessment of valuation after price slide and investor skepticism (Yahoo Finance). This highlights existing doubts about the company's prospects.
*   **Delta Flight Delays:** Debt “Reset,” Analyst Targets, and the Long Road to Delta Flights (ts2.tech). Delays in the Delta program (a key initiative) are a concern.
*   **Space Sector Hype (Momentus news is tangential):** Momentus Stock Explodes 80% To Start 2026 As Space-Defense Hype Ignites Retail Frenzy (Stocktwits) and 2026 Could Be the Breakout Year for Space Stocks (InvestorPlace). These articles suggest a general positive outlook for the space sector, but this doesn't guarantee success for individual companies like SPCE.
*   **Partnership with LLNL:** Virgin Galactic (NYSE: SPCE) partners with LLNL on HALE-Heavy imaging study (Stock Titan). This is a positive development, showing potential for new applications of their technology.

**Analysis:** Recent news is a mixed bag. Debt restructuring, valuation concerns, and Delta program delays are negative.  Partnerships and general sector optimism are potential positives. The market's reaction to these events seems to be more aligned with the negative news, given the continued stock decline.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** None
*   **Mean Rating:** - (no meaningful data)
*   **Opinions:** 6 analysts
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 4.12 / High: 8.00 / Low: 2.00

**Analysis:**  The lack of a consensus rating suggests analysts are uncertain or divided on SPCE. The average target price of $4.12 is only slightly above the current price, while the low target ($2.00) indicates significant downside risk according to some analysts. The lack of recent rating changes suggests a period of assessment or inactivity by analysts.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜        | EPS    | 매출       |

**Analysis:**

*   **EPS:** Earnings per share (EPS) are consistently negative and generally decreasing (becoming more negative), indicating significant losses.
*   **매출 (Revenue):** Revenue is zero across all reported quarters. This is a critical issue, as the company is not generating any substantial revenue from its operations.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Virgin Galactic is facing significant challenges.

*   **Financial Performance:**  The company is not generating substantial revenue, is experiencing large losses (negative EPS and profit margins), and is burning through its capital. The substantial and increasing negative returns underscore the poor financial performance and are significantly divergent from the overall market.
*   **Market Sentiment:** Investor skepticism is high, as reflected in the stock's underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the decreasing stock price relative to simple moving averages, and the ongoing coverage of valuation concerns.
*   **Risk:** The high volatility (Beta), negative expected return, and negative analyst ratings indicate very high risk.
*   **Technical Indicators:** While the recent divergence change hints at a potential short-term rebound, the overall trend based on moving averages and PPO is bearish.
*   **News:** Recent news is mixed, but the negative aspects (debt restructuring, Delta program delays) appear to be weighing more heavily on the stock.
*   **Analyst Opinion:** Lack of analyst consensus reflects general uncertainly about the stock, with target prices varying greatly.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the data, an investment in SPCE is very risky. The company's financial performance is poor, market sentiment is negative, and there are significant challenges to its business model. Investors should exercise extreme caution and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in Virgin Galactic. The "Medium Investment" recommendation from the MRI seems inconsistent with the overwhelmingly negative data. Further research and due diligence are essential.
