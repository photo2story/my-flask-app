2026-01-01 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the SPCE (Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.) data, including analysis and a summary.

**Report: SPCE Analysis**

**0. Overview**

*   **Company Overview:** Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. is a spaceflight company focused on suborbital spaceflight for private individuals and researchers.

**1. Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **SPCE Cumulative Return:** -79.82%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 83.29%
*   **Divergence:** -163.1 (Relative Divergence: 0.4)

**Analysis:** SPCE has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The divergence between the two is substantial, indicating a very poor investment compared to the broader market. The relative divergence of 0.4 suggests that the current level of underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range relative to VOO, but it's still a deeply negative value.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    | Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
    |------------|--------|--------|---------|------|--------|
    | 2024-2026  | -80.0% | 82.0% | -163.0% | 0.0  | 0.2    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The -80% CAGR indicates a massive loss in value over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The 82% MDD means that the stock experienced a peak-to-trough decline of 82%, indicating very high risk.
*   **Alpha:** The extremely negative Alpha of -163.0% shows that the stock has severely underperformed its expected return based on its beta and the market return.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of 0 suggests that SPCE's price movements are not correlated with the overall market. In theory, a Beta of 1 would suggest the stock moves with the S&P 500 and a Beta of < 1 would suggest that it is not as volatile.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap of 0.2 Billion
*   The analysis further supports the underperformance and extreme volatility of SPCE.

*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative divergence change confirms the recent downtrend.
*   **Expected Return:** The overwhelmingly negative expected return underscores the extremely high risk associated with this stock.
