*   Last Market Data: Price 3.21, Previous Close 3.3, Change -2.73%
*   5-day SMA: 3.232
*   20-day SMA: 3.5685
*   60-day SMA: 3.7473

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a downward trend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, further confirming this bearish signal. The recent price decrease of -2.73% indicates immediate selling pressure.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   MRI: 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 40.89
*   PPO: -0.76
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (262 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: 0.5 (+) indicates a short-term rise.
*   Expected Return (%): 0.0

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.9 suggests that current market conditions are favorable for investment in general, but this might not translate into success for this specific stock. The MRI might be reflecting broader market optimism rather than SPCE's individual prospects.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 40.89 is close to the oversold level (30), hinting at the possibility of a potential rebound, but it's not yet definitively oversold.
    *   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-0.76) indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downward trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests buying, however given the other indicators such as negative PPO, the hybrid signal should be taken with a grain of salt.
    *   **Divergence Change:** The short-term rise in divergence suggests a short-term bullish move, but needs to be further confirmed with a breakout above the moving averages.
    *   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 0% indicates that analysts don't foresee the stock generating any profit compared to the S&P 500, even in the long term.
    *   **Price Fluctuation:** Given the large change of -2.73%, it shows a volatile market for SPCE.
