**3. RSI, PPO and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.89
*   **PPO:** -0.76
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (262 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.5 (+)  (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the negative performance, the MRI suggests high investment recommendation, which is counter-intuitive given other indicators. This is most likely due to recent events or news impacting the MRI calculation.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 40.89 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* suggest a potential for a price reversal.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO (-0.76) indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Recommends buying, even with a 0% cash ratio - which implies being fully invested. This contradicts the negative performance and is likely based on the MRI score, and the short-term rise.
*   **Recent relative divergence change:** Indicates short-term rise.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 0.0% suggests no anticipated excess return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

SPCE is facing significant challenges. Its stock performance has been extremely poor, vastly underperforming the S&P 500. The company is not generating revenue and is consistently reporting negative earnings and profit margins. The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) and negative Alpha suggest high risk and underperformance relative to the market. Recent news highlights concerns about valuation and the need for debt restructuring. While there are some positive developments, such as partnerships, the overall picture is concerning.

The current Market Risk Indicator (MRI) is oddly high, and the hybrid signal recommends buying. These conflict with other indicators, the trend, and financial health of the company. Investors should exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering an investment in SPCE. The consensus target price from analysts suggests *some* potential upside, but given the inherent risks and negative financials, this target should be viewed with skepticism. There's a short-term signal to buy and divergence increasing (short-term), but longer-term investing is *extremely* risky.
