**Analysis:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:** SPCE has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The large negative relative divergence indicates this underperformance is at its historical worst relative to the index.
*   **Alpha/Beta Concerns:**  The consistently negative alpha in recent years suggests the company is not generating returns independent of the market. The negative Beta means it's inversely correlated to the market(S&P500,VOO).
*   **High Volatility:** The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate very high price volatility and substantial potential losses for investors.
*   **Shrinking Market Cap:**  The declining market capitalization (Cap) suggests a loss of investor confidence and value.

*   **Recent Price Change:** The slightly positive change in the last trading session suggests a small upward movement, but it's not significant enough to indicate a major shift in trend.
