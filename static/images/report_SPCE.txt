*   **Alpha:**  The persistently negative Alpha suggests SPCE is consistently underperforming relative to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta is close to 0. This suggests that the return of this stock is essentially unrelated to that of the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 3.16
*   **Previous Close:** 3.34
*   **Change:** -5.39%
*   **5-day SMA:** 3.444
*   **20-day SMA:** 3.6647
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.7984

*Analysis:* The price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a downtrend. The recent price drop of -5.39% confirms this.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended).  This is *counterintuitive* given the other indicators. The provided scale seems to be inverted.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 30.77.  This is near oversold territory (typically below 30), suggesting the stock *could* be due for a bounce.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.8721. This is negative, further confirming the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (253 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
    *   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying; however, this conflicts with other indicators.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise).  This suggests a recent upward shift in the relative divergence, but the context of high negative divergence needs to be considered.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10472.2.  This is an incredibly negative expected return, highlighting the severe risks.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **SPCE Stock Price Prediction:** Predictions for future prices in 2025, 2026, and 2030 are inherently speculative.
*   **SpaceX IPO:**  News about a potential SpaceX IPO could indirectly influence sentiment towards space-related stocks, including SPCE, although SpaceX and SPCE operate in different segments of the space industry. Investors might become more aware of space-related investments.
*   **Comparison with Redwire:** The article suggesting SPCE is a better "moonshot bet" than Redwire is relevant but requires deeper investigation into the reasoning behind the comparison.
*   **Virgin Galactic Stock (SPCE) Today:**  This type of article likely provides a summary of recent news and analysis, which is useful for understanding the current situation.
*   **Sidus Space Stock:** This is a potentially a distraction as the company may have little relevance to SPCE.
*   **Space Stock Karman Eyes New Buy Point:** This is another distraction as the company may have little relevance to SPCE.

*Analysis:*  The news headlines present a mixed picture. Some articles focus on future potential, while others compare SPCE to other space stocks. The market sentiment appears to be mixed.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Mean:** - (Implies a Neutral or Insufficient Data)
*   **Opinions:** 6
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 4.12 / 8.00 / 2.00

*Analysis:* Analyst opinions are mixed. The average target price of $4.12 is higher than the current price, suggesting some potential upside according to analysts, but the range is wide ($2.00 to $8.00), reflecting uncertainty. The lack of recent rating changes is less helpful.
