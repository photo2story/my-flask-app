**4. Recent Financials and Outlook:**

The provided financial data reveals consistent and substantial losses (negative EPS) and zero revenue across multiple reporting periods.  There is no information on earnings expectations for the most recent period provided.  The extremely negative profit margins (-hundreds or thousands of percent) further underscore the significant financial challenges the company is facing.

**5.  Quarterly Financials Analysis:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability tables indicate consistent significant losses and negative profitability,  with very low or no revenue.  The negative Return on Equity (ROE) shows that the company is not generating returns for its shareholders.


**6.  News and Recent Issues:**

* *Information Missing*:  The prompt requested analysis of recent news within the last two days, including earnings news from sources such as shacknews and FINBOLD. This information was not provided, preventing a comprehensive analysis of recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.  Access to financial news sources would be needed to complete this section.

**7. Overall Analysis (Summary of Points 1-6):**

SPCE is currently demonstrating significantly poor performance relative to the S&P 500, marked by substantial losses and an absence of significant revenue generation. Technical indicators offer a mixed signal, with a neutral RSI and slightly positive relative divergence.  However, the strongly negative PPO suggests bearish momentum. The company's financial health is extremely precarious, showing large, consistent losses and zero revenue across multiple quarters. The lack of recent news analysis prevents a complete evaluation of current market sentiment. Without a substantial improvement in revenue and profitability, along with a change in market sentiment, the long-term outlook for SPCE remains very negative.  The 0% expected return accurately reflects the risk profile based on current performance.
