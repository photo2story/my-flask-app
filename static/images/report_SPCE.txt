    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is significantly negative in recent years, indicating substantial losses.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is very high, consistently over 70%, suggesting extreme volatility and potential for significant losses from peak to trough.
    *   **Alpha:** The negative Alpha indicates that SPCE is significantly underperforming relative to its benchmark.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta is near 0 or negative, which is unusual. Ideally, beta should be around 1 (meaning the asset moves in the same direction as the market, but less so, or more so depending on the coefficient). A negative beta means that the stock tends to move in the opposite direction to the market; so when the market goes up, it goes down, or vice versa.
    *   **Cap(B):** Shows Market Capitalization in Billions. Consistently declining.
    *   **Overall Impression:** SPCE has shown poor performance with very high volatility and a lack of positive risk-adjusted returns in the provided period.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Current Close Price: $3.30
*   Last Market Data:
    *   Price: $3.30
    *   Previous Close: $3.15

*   **Analysis of Stock Price:** The stock price increased 4.76% in the last trading day. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend, but the price remains below the longer-term averages.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 38.25 (Approaching Oversold territory, but not quite there yet)
*   PPO: -0.80 (Negative, suggesting a downtrend)
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (253 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Invest 1% monthly.
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -0.7 (short-term decline)
*   Expected Return (%): -10606.3% (Extremely negative expected return)

*   **Analysis of Indicators:**
    *   **MRI:** Despite the poor performance, the MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation.  This may be due to recent short-term factors or the model's assessment of long-term potential.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 38.25 indicates that the stock is not yet oversold, implying that there might be further downward potential.
    *   **PPO:** The negative PPO value confirms that the stock is currently in a downtrend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a 100% buy with existing cash while allocating a very small amount to invest on a monthly basis. This is a very safe signal as the MRI is 0.90, so this hybrid signal has a high confidence.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-10606.3%) is a very strong warning sign.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   Consensus:
    *   Mean (1=StrongBuy~5=Sell):  No rating available
    *   Opinions: 6
    *   Target Price (avg/high/low): 4.12 / 8.00 / 2.00

*   **Analysis of Analyst Opinions:** The lack of a consensus rating, coupled with a wide range in the target price ($2.00 to $8.00), indicates considerable uncertainty and disagreement among analysts regarding SPCE's future prospects.  The average target price of $4.12 is slightly above the current price, suggesting a *potential* upside, but the low target price indicates significant downside risk is also perceived.

*   **Negative Alpha and Beta:** Negative Alpha indicates the stock is underperforming its benchmark. Beta suggests that it is moving in the opposite direction to the market, or barely correlating.
*   **Zero Revenue and Negative Earnings:** Consistent lack of revenue and negative EPS highlights the company's inability to generate profits.
*   **Deteriorating Financials:** Declining equity and severely negative ROE raise concerns about the company's financial health.
*   **Mixed Analyst Opinions:** While the average target price suggests potential upside, the wide range and lack of consensus indicate high uncertainty.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The calculated expected return is extremely negative, suggesting significant potential for further losses.
*   **News Sentiment:** Recent news headlines focus on valuation concerns and comparisons to better-performing space stocks.

**Conclusion:** Based on this analysis, investing in SPCE appears to be extremely risky.
