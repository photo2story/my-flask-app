| 2023-2025  | -29.0%   | 82.0%    | -93.0%   | -0.2   | 0.2    |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is consistently negative in recent periods, reflecting a significant decline in investment value.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is very high, indicating significant potential losses from peak to trough. The high MDD values highlight the high risk and volatility associated with SPCE.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is overwhelmingly negative, implying SPCE is significantly underperforming its benchmark after accounting for risk. This underperformance is a major concern.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is near zero, indicating the stock's price is practically unrelated to overall market movements, however this Beta could be misleading given the company's unique situation. It's difficult to make a valid comparison.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has decreased dramatically over time, suggesting significant investor sell-off and loss of confidence.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 3.935
*   **Last-market:** price: 3.935, previousClose: 3.79, change: 3.83
*   **5-day SMA:** 3.675
*   **20-day SMA:** 3.5852
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.7343
*   **Analysis:** The closing price is above all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This *could* be interpreted as a short-term bullish signal, but it's crucial to consider it within the broader context of the company's struggles.  The recent price change suggests a moderate positive movement.

**3) RSI, PPO and other Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 60.62
*   **PPO:** 1.38
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (253 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.5 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10284.4
*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggesting "High Investment Recommended" seems extremely optimistic and possibly misleading, considering all the other data. The RSI is nearing overbought territory (above 70 is typically considered overbought). The PPO being positive suggests short-term upward momentum.  The recent divergence change suggests a short-term downtrend.  The *extremely* negative Expected Return is a massive red flag, indicating very poor long-term prospects according to the model. The provided Hybrid Signal is at odds with other data points, likely because it uses MRI as an input.
