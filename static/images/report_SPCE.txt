Okay, let's break down this analysis of Virgin Galactic (SPCE).

**0. Executive Summary**

SPCE is significantly underperforming the S&P 500. Its recent stock performance is showing some signs of potential short-term gains, but long-term indicators are overwhelmingly negative. The company is burning through cash with minimal revenue and substantial losses, making it a very high-risk investment. Analyst opinions are mixed but generally lean bearish, and recent news highlights financial concerns.

**1. Return Rate Comparison**

*   **5-day SMA:** 3.95
*   **20-day SMA:** 3.63
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.76

**Analysis:** SPCE's price closed at 4.35. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, which could indicate a short-term bullish trend. However, it is important to consider this trend within the context of the overall long-term negative performance.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 67.98
*   **PPO:** 2.42
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (253 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.5 (decreasing)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10284.4%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium investment. However, given the other negative indicators, this may be misleading.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 67.98 is approaching the overbought territory (above 70), suggesting a potential pullback.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which can be a bullish sign, although it may indicate a potential short-term fluctuation.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** A buy recommendation (100% of cash) combined with a monthly investment plan. This strategy seems to suggest a long-term bullish outlook, but it contradicts the high risks indicated by the other indicators.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** A negative change in relative divergence indicates short-term downside.
*   **Expected Return:**  The extremely negative expected return (-10284.4%) is a major red flag, indicating significant expected losses compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.
