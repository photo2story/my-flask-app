| 2023-2025  | -33.0%   | 82.0%  | -101.0%  | -0.2   | 0.2    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) demonstrates a steep decline over the years, turning negative and significantly underperforming.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The negative and increasingly large Alpha values suggest significant underperformance compared to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to zero suggest a very weak correlation with the overall market, meaning SPCE's price movements are largely independent of the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has shrunk dramatically, from $14.6B to $0.2B

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 3.16
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 3.15, Previous Close: 3.16, Change: -0.32
*   **5-day SMA:** 3.444
*   **20-day SMA:** 3.6647
*   **60-day SMA:** 3.7984

**Analysis:**

*   The stock is currently trading below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA), which typically suggests a downtrend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are below the 60-day SMA, reinforcing this downward trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 30.77
*   **PPO:** -0.87
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (253 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.4 (+): 단기상승 (short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10472.2

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the "High Investment Recommended" label, the high MRI value should be interpreted with caution, especially in light of the other indicators and financial data. High MRI values can sometimes be generated by short-term momentum, but do not override long-term challenges with the stock.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 30.77 suggests the stock is approaching oversold conditions, which *could* indicate a potential for a bounce, but should not be considered a buy signal in isolation.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, reinforcing the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal indicates a "Buy" recommendation. However, it contradicts other poor indicators.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** A positive change in relative divergence over 20 days suggests a short-term upward trend relative to its historical divergence from the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extraordinarily negative Expected Return suggests analysts don't expect it to reach the level of the S\&P500 over the next 2 years.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   The news headlines present a mixed picture:
    *   Some articles offer price predictions for the coming years (2025, 2026, 2030).
    *   One article suggests Virgin Galactic might be a better "moonshot bet" than Redwire Stock.
    *   Another provides news, forecasts, and analysis for the stock.
    *   Another article analyzes retail investors' interest in Sidus Space Stock.
    *   One suggests Karman Eyes New Buy Point After Bullish Move.

**Analysis:**

*   The news is a mixed bag, but the sheer number of articles indicates continued interest (and potentially volatility) in space-related stocks.
*   The presence of "moonshot bet" articles suggests a high-risk, high-reward perception of the stock.
*   It's crucial to read the full articles to understand the specific reasoning behind each headline's claims.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** No key rating
*   **Mean Rating:** -
*   **Opinions:** 6
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 4.12 / 8.00 / 2.00

**Analysis:**

*   The small sample size of analyst opinions (6) limits the strength of the consensus.
*   The wide range between the high ($8.00) and low ($2.00) target prices indicates significant disagreement among analysts regarding the stock's future potential.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Virgin Galactic (SPCE) presents a highly concerning picture based on the data provided:

*   **Underperformance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Downtrend:** The stock is in a downtrend, trading below its moving averages.
*   **Financials:** The company is not generating revenue, is burning through capital, and has consistently negative earnings and profitability metrics.
*   **Analyst Disagreement:** There is a lack of strong consensus among analysts, with a wide range in target prices.
*   **Risk:** The stock appears to be a very risky investment, despite the "High Investment Recommended" label from the MRI. The MDD are high, and the low Beta does not provide the stability of mirroring the performance of the S\&P500.

**Conclusion:**

While the MRI recommends investment, the overwhelming evidence from other indicators, financials, and analyst opinions suggests that investing in SPCE would be extremely risky. The company needs to demonstrate its ability to generate consistent revenue and achieve profitability before it can be considered a sound investment. The information suggests a high-risk, speculative investment rather than a stable, long-term one.
