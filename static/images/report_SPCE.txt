*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 30.77
*   **PPO:** -0.87

*   **Expected Return (%):** -10472.2%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Although the MRI suggests High Investment Recommended, this seems contradictory when viewed in conjunction with other factors. It might be a contrarian indicator or based on a specific model that does not account for all risks.
*   **RSI:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 30.77, which is near the oversold threshold (typically below 30). This might indicate a potential for a price rebound.
*   **PPO:** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is negative (-0.87), indicating a bearish trend and that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests buying 100% of cash with a monthly investment of 1% of total investment, considering it a "Very Safe" play with MRI: 0.90. However, consider the other data points before making such a decision.
*   **Divergence Change:** The positive change in relative divergence over the past 20 days suggests a short-term upward movement.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-10472.2%) is highly concerning and indicates a very pessimistic outlook for the stock's long-term performance.
