    *   **Alpha:**  The negative alpha values indicate significant underperformance relative to a benchmark, suggesting poor stock selection.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is very close to zero or negative, suggesting stock price doesn't closely follow the market.

*   **Previous Close:** \$3.21
*   **Change:** 2.18%
*   **5-day SMA:** \$3.17
*   **20-day SMA:** \$3.67
*   **60-day SMA:** \$3.82

    *   The stock price has recently increased.  However, the current price is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting it is still in a short-term downtrend. The recent change reflects a possible rebound.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 38.83

    *   The RSI is below 40, indicating that the stock is nearing "oversold" territory, which *could* suggest a potential buying opportunity for some investors (but should not be considered in isolation).

*   **PPO:** -2.42

    *   The negative PPO value suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, signaling a downtrend.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (253 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)

    * The analysis recommends investing with MRI:0.9, which contrasts sharply with current MRI:0.7, highlighting a divergence between recommendation and present market condition.

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.5 (-): Short-term decline

    *   Confirms the recent downward trend.

*   **Expected Return (%):** -10478.2%

    *   This is an extremely negative expected return. It signals a very high-risk investment and suggests that the model predicts continued underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Themes:** The news headlines reflect a mix of speculation and concern:
    *   **Price Predictions:**  Some articles attempt to predict future stock prices, often with a wide range of potential outcomes.
    *   **Stock Crash:** At least one article highlights a significant price decline.
    *   **Cash Burn:** A significant amount of news and events discuss cash burn and potential outlooks.
    *   **Space Industry/Competition:** There is mention of the broader space industry and competition.

4-2) **Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 2.88)
*   **Target Price:** \$4.12 (Avg)

    *   Analysts, on average, have a "Hold" rating on the stock, and the average target price is slightly above the current price. The wide range in target prices (\$2.00 to \$8.00) indicates a lack of strong conviction among analysts. The lack of recent rating changes (indicated by the empty parentheses) suggests that analyst opinions have been stable (and perhaps haven't kept up with recent performance).

SPCE is a high-risk stock exhibiting significant financial distress.  Here's a breakdown:

*   **Underperformance:** The stock has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Financials:** The company is not generating revenue and has extremely negative profit margins.  Equity is declining, and ROE is negative. Earnings per share are consistently negative.
*   **Technical Indicators:** While the RSI suggests the stock might be approaching oversold territory, the PPO indicates a continuing downtrend.
*   **Analyst Opinion:** Analysts have a "Hold" rating but show little conviction.
*   **News:** News articles highlight both potential future growth and current challenges (including stock crashes and cash burn).
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return suggests a very high risk of continued underperformance.
*   **MRI Indicator:** While the MRI is at a "Medium Investment" level, this contrasts against the Hybrid Signal which is higher at MRI:0.9, highlighting internal disagreement.

**Overall Recommendation:** Based on the data provided, investing in SPCE is highly speculative and carries substantial risk. The company's financials are weak, and its stock performance has been poor.  The potential for future growth in the space tourism industry doesn't negate the significant financial challenges and uncertainties facing the company today. Any investment should be considered extremely high-risk and only with capital that the investor can afford to lose. The data suggests exercising extreme caution and conducting thorough due diligence before investing in SPCE.
