| 2023-2025  | 127.0% | 7.2% | 66.0% | 0.7 | 3084.3 |

The consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and relatively low MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicate strong and stable growth.  The Alpha values suggest consistent outperformance compared to the benchmark, especially in recent years.  Beta values show a generally low correlation with the overall market, except for a slight increase in recent years.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $415.06
* **Last Market Price:** $414.88
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $430.83
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $428.40
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $429.22

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The recent price drop is relatively small and might not be significant on its own.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 47.97 (Slightly below neutral; not significantly oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.25 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -9.4% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 87.4% (Long-term potential outperformance)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI is not deeply oversold, the negative PPO and recent relative divergence suggest bearish short-term momentum. However, the high expected return suggests strong long-term potential.  The small price drop indicated in `Last-market` doesn't suggest a significant event.
