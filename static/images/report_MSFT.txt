*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 68.0%   | 67.9%  | 40.0%   | 0.0  | 635.8  |
| 2016-2018  | 29.0%   | 71.9%  | 13.0%   | 0.0  | 755.0  |
| 2017-2019  | 65.0%   | 80.7%  | 42.0%   | 0.2  | 1172.2 |
| 2018-2020  | 54.0%   | 80.7%  | 30.0%   | 0.2  | 1653.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 125.0%  | 80.7%  | 78.0%   | 0.4  | 2499.9 |
| 2020-2022  | -63.0%  | 80.7%  | -62.0%  | 0.6  | 1782.6 |
| 2021-2023  | -49.0%  | 80.7%  | -51.0%  | 0.7  | 2795.2 |
| 2022-2024  | -71.0%  | 80.7%  | -91.0%  | 0.8  | 3133.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 28.0%   | 79.4%  | -31.0%  | 0.9  | 3509.3 |

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Highly variable, showing periods of strong growth followed by significant declines in recent years.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD suggests significant volatility and risk over these periods.
    *   **Alpha:** Positive Alpha in earlier periods indicates outperformance relative to its risk (Beta). However, recent years show negative Alpha, implying underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is increasing over time, indicating that Microsoft's stock is becoming more correlated with the overall market. A Beta of 0.9 suggests it moves roughly in line with the market.
    *   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** Market cap has grown significantly, but the recent performance suggests challenges in translating that size into consistent returns.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   Current Close: 472.12
*   Previous Close: 478.43
*   Change: -1.32
*   5-day SMA: 487.79
*   20-day SMA: 508.0751
*   60-day SMA: 510.9243

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a downtrend. The small negative change from the previous day might signal further downward pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO Index, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 24.29
*   PPO: -0.79
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = -3.2 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   Expected Return (%): 1449.5

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI:** Suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 24.29 indicates that the stock is oversold and *could* be due for a potential rebound (but could stay oversold for extended periods).
    *   **PPO:** A negative PPO value (-0.79) signifies that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, which also indicates a downtrend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** A "Buy" signal implies the system believes it's a good time to purchase the stock, reinforced by the "Very Safe" assessment based on the given parameters and MRI. The suggestion to invest a small percentage monthly is a DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) strategy.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** Reinforces the short-term downward trend.
    *   **Expected Return:**  A very high expected return should be viewed with skepticism.  Such high numbers are often generated by models that are overfitted to past data or based on overly optimistic assumptions.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Headlines:** Several headlines are concerning:
    *   Bill Gates selling a significant portion of his Microsoft stock raises questions (though he might have many personal financial reasons unrelated to the company's prospects).
    *   Analysts downgrading the stock and suggesting a lower entry point of $450 indicate a lack of confidence in the short-term outlook.
    *   Concerns about a "Steam Machine" posing an "existential threat" sound alarming (though we need more context on what this threat is and how likely it is to materialize).
*   **Positive Headlines:**
    *   Microsoft's AI "superfactory" powering a stock rally is a positive development, suggesting potential future growth.
    *   The article about Nvidia's AI dominance is a mixed bag: It highlights the strength of the AI sector, in which Microsoft also has a significant presence.

*   **Analysis:** The news sentiment is mixed but leans slightly negative. The concerns about Bill Gates' stock sales and analyst downgrades are potential red flags. However, positive developments in AI could offset these concerns. The "Steam Machine" threat should be investigated further.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   Consensus: Strong Buy (Mean 1.25)
*   Target Price: Average 625.41 (High 730.00, Low 483.00)

*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus remains positive, with a strong buy rating and a significant upside potential indicated by the average target price. However, the low target price is close to the current price, which could indicate some analysts are less optimistic.  It's also important to consider the *range* of target prices – a wide range suggests less certainty among analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜        | EPS  | 매출       |

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **Revenue:** Consistently growing revenue suggests strong demand for Microsoft's products and services.
    *   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are very high and relatively stable, indicating strong pricing power and efficient operations.
    *   **Equity:** Increasing equity reflects the company's accumulation of assets and retained earnings.
    *   **ROE (Return on Equity):** While still healthy, ROE has slightly declined in the most recent quarter.  This is something to monitor – is it a temporary dip, or the start of a trend?

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Microsoft is showing mixed signals.

*   **Negative Indicators:**
    *   Underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and negative recent Alpha.
    *   Downtrending stock price (below moving averages).
    *   Negative short-term divergence change.
    *   Concerning news headlines related to Bill Gates' stock sales and analyst downgrades.
*   **Positive Indicators:**
    *   Strong and growing revenue and EPS.
    *   High and stable profit margins.
    *   "Oversold" RSI.
    *   Positive analyst consensus (though with some caveats).
    *   Potential growth drivers in AI.
*   **Overall Assessment:**

    The recent underperformance and negative news sentiment warrant caution. The company faces potential headwinds. However, its strong financial performance, positive analyst outlook, and potential in AI suggest it could recover.

    The recommendation would be to **carefully monitor the situation**. Look for confirmation of a turnaround in the stock price and continued strong earnings reports. Pay close attention to developments related to AI and any commentary from management regarding the impact of the factors mentioned in the negative news headlines.  The very high "expected return" should be disregarded as unrealistic.

    Consider the medium MRI and Hybrid Signal, but prioritize risk management and monitor for shifts in market dynamics before making significant investment decisions. The analyst downgrades and high MDD values suggest potential downside risk. The situation warrants a "wait and see" approach.
