### 7. 종합 분석

Microsoft (MSFT) has recently underperformed the S&P 500, but recent positive price movement and a high expected return suggest potential upside. While the RSI indicates it may be approaching an oversold condition, analyst sentiment and financial performance data indicate a Strong Buy recommendation. The company's focus on AI and data centers, along with consistent revenue growth and high-profit margins, support a positive long-term outlook. However, high volatility, as indicated by the MDD and rising Beta, suggests that MSFT may be riskier than the overall market, and a potential investor must take it into account.
