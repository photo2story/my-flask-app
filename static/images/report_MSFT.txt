2025-01-12 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Microsoft (MSFT) based on the provided data, presented in a report format:

**Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Investment Report**

**1. Performance Summary & Relative Strength:**

Microsoft is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.

The cumulative return of MSFT is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 202.8%,  representing a 75.4% percentile rank compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates MSFT has significantly outperformed the market over the measured period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $418.95
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $423.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $434.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $426.84

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend.  However, this needs to be considered within the broader context of longer-term trends.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 31.38 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.50 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Strength Change:** +0.6 – Indicates a recent short-term uptrend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 77.1% – This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.  This is a significant projected outperformance but should be viewed cautiously as future performance is never guaranteed.

The current price ($418.95) being below the moving averages, coupled with a low RSI and negative PPO, points towards potential short-term downside risks. However, the positive relative strength change and significant projected long-term excess return might indicate a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors.
