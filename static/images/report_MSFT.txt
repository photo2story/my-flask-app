* **20-Day Moving Average:** $421.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $420.49

The stock price is currently trading below its short-term moving averages, suggesting potential downward pressure.  The relatively close proximity of the moving averages indicates a period of consolidation or slight downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 39.7 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.04 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.13 – Indicates a recent short-term bearish divergence, supporting the negative PPO reading.
* **Expected Return:** 37.9% – This represents the anticipated excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy.  This high expected return needs to be considered alongside the current risks.  The recent price decline might present a good entry point.  If the last market close ($413.59) is considered significantly higher, it implies a sharp downturn, which is inconsistent with the other data points.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Microsoft shows strong long-term growth potential based on its historical performance exceeding the S&P 500 and a high projected excess return.  However, current technical indicators (RSI, PPO, relative divergence) suggest near-term bearish momentum.  The stock is trading below its short-term moving averages, indicating potential downside.  Despite this, the strong financial fundamentals (high revenue, profit margins, and ROE) present a compelling case for a long-term investment, especially if purchased at the current, potentially discounted, price.  Further investigation into the latest earnings reports and analyst opinions is crucial to refine the risk assessment and investment strategy.
