*   **20-day SMA:** 481.82
*   **60-day SMA:** 503.63

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is above the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), which *could* signal short-term upward momentum. However, the price is still below the 60-day SMA, suggesting that the longer-term trend may still be downward or at least not strongly bullish.
*   The positive change from the previous close indicates a recent price increase.
*   The fact that the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA is a bearish sign, but the 20 day is catching up.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 43.86
*   **PPO:** 0.12

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.6 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 378.4 (Long-term expectation)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI of 43.86 is below 50 (neutral), indicating the stock is not overbought, but not oversold either.
*   The PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is slightly above the longer-term moving average, supporting a possible short-term bullish trend, as indicated by the recent relative divergence change.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying a large percentage of cash.
*   The very high Expected Return is surprisingly high and should be treated with caution.  It suggests the model anticipates significant future growth relative to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

The news headlines present a mixed picture:

*   **AI Focus:** Several articles highlight Microsoft's involvement in AI, with some suggesting it may be lagging behind competitors like Alphabet and Amazon.
*   **Analyst Forecasts:** There's coverage of analyst forecasts and price targets for MSFT.

*   **Competition:** Articles compare Microsoft to Alphabet, suggesting Alphabet may be a better investment (according to some).
*   **OpenAI Talks:** Discussions about Microsoft's OpenAI relationship are circulating.

**Analysis:**

*   The news indicates a dynamic environment with both opportunities (AI) and challenges (competition, potential underperformance relative to peers). The focus on AI is a key theme. The news, when analyzed together with current PPO and recent divergence change may point out that this time could be a good time to buy.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy (Mean: 1.29)

**Analysis:**

*   The overwhelming consensus from analysts is a "Strong Buy" with a significant number of opinions.
*   The average target price of 624.45 indicates a potential upside of 29% from the current price (483.98).
*   The high target price (730.00) suggests some analysts are very optimistic. However, the low target price (483.00) is the current price, suggesting at least one analyst sees no upside. The current price is the lowest target price, and from an analyst's perspective, it's a strong buy, and the market needs to reflect these forecasts in the long run.
