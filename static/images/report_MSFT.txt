More context, such as analyst estimates and compared to previous quarters or years, is necessary for a complete analysis. The provided data is insufficient for a comprehensive assessment of performance, especially regarding the most recent earnings which are incomplete and seem to contain duplicate data.  Further analysis requires complete and verified data.

| 2024-10-30 | 3.32  | 65.58         |

Recent price action suggests a slight short-term bearish trend, but the long-term outlook remains relatively positive, contingent on the accuracy of the provided expected return (38%).
