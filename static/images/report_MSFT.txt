**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $415.76
* **5-day Moving Average:** $421.18
* **20-day Moving Average:** $421.24
* **60-day Moving Average:** $420.49

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 39.7 - This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.04 - A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -2.13 - Shows a recent short-term downward trend.

Given the price of $415.75 is below the moving averages and RSI is in oversold territory, there's a possibility of a short-term bounce, but further declines cannot be ruled out given the negative PPO.  A significant price drop would be needed to classify as a "crash".  A sharp upward move would require a change in overall market sentiment.

**Expected Return:** 37.9%  This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500, assuming continued strong performance.  This is a forward-looking estimate and not a guaranteed return.
