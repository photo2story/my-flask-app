**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha values, indicating that MSFT generated returns above what would be expected given its beta (market risk). Beta values generally indicate a higher than average market sensitivity, however, this sensitivity decreases recently.

Note that higher CAGR values often coincide with higher MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values, suggesting higher risk-adjusted returns in some periods.

* **Closing Price:** $388.61
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $393.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $405.54
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $423.68

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, this is a short-term observation and doesn't negate the longer-term positive trend evidenced by the cumulative returns.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 29.94 (Approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.41 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.5% (Short-term bearish movement)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 107.7% (This is a very high expected return over the long term, which is a forecast and not a guaranteed return.)

The small positive change in price from the previous close (0.03%) is not significant enough to qualify as a sudden surge or decline.  The high expected return should be viewed cautiously, as it is a long-term projection and market conditions can change.
