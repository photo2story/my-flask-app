**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Microsoft significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return difference of 129.8% highlights this substantial outperformance.  The relative divergence suggests that this level of outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.  Analyzing the alpha and beta values across different years reveals periods of high alpha (outperformance attributed to factors other than market movements), particularly in recent years.  However, the beta, a measure of market sensitivity, has also increased in recent years, indicating that MSFT's price movements are becoming more correlated with overall market trends. The consistently high CAGR, despite some periods of negative returns, demonstrates robust long-term growth potential.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Microsoft demonstrates strong financial performance with consistent revenue growth, high profit margins, and a healthy ROE.  The stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, exhibiting substantial alpha in several years. While recent price action shows a minor dip and the stock is below its moving averages suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend, the long-term outlook appears positive, supported by high expected returns.  However, it's crucial to consider the increasing beta, suggesting increased market sensitivity. Further investigation is needed to address data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) and to thoroughly analyze the underlying factors driving both the stock's performance and the changes in its alpha and beta. A thorough risk assessment considering the medium risk indicated by the MRI is also necessary.  The projected 89.2% expected return needs to be viewed in the context of the associated risks before making any investment decisions.
