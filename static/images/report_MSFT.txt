## Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Microsoft Corp (MSFT), a multinational technology company developing, manufacturing, licensing, supporting, and selling computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.  Key performance indicators (KPIs) are evaluated against the S&P 500 (VOO) benchmark to assess MSFT's relative performance and risk.


**1) Performance Comparison:**

MSFT's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.

* **MSFT Cumulative Return:** 126.59%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 76.18%
* **Return Difference:** 50.41%
* **Relative Divergence:** 28.1% (This indicates MSFT's performance is in the upper 28.1% percentile relative to its historical performance against VOO.  It does *not* mean it outperformed VOO by 28.1%).

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows varying performance across different periods.  While alpha (excess return) generally remains positive, indicating outperformance, beta (volatility relative to the market) fluctuates, suggesting sensitivity to market conditions. Notably, recent years (2022-2025) show negative CAGR, high MDD (maximum drawdown), and high Beta.  This indicates a period of underperformance, possibly due to macroeconomic factors or company-specific issues.


**2) Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $367.78
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $380.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $379.86
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $396.77

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The recent price change of -$1.03 (-0.28%) from the previous close is a minor daily decline, but the significant gap between the current price and the moving averages implies a more pronounced downward trend.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk)  The MRI suggests a moderate risk level for MSFT.
* **RSI:** 45.02 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting potential for further price movement in either direction.)
* **PPO:** 0.1551 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, though relatively weak.)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -3.0% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 214.6% (over 2 years) â€“ This is a remarkably high expected return. Further clarification on the methodology used to calculate this figure is needed.  This high number should be approached with caution.

The recent price drop of -$1.03, while not dramatic, should be considered in conjunction with the downward trend indicated by the moving averages and the negative relative divergence change.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

MSFT has historically shown strong performance relative to the S&P 500, but recent data (2022-2025) reveals a period of underperformance and increased volatility.  While financial information demonstrates consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, the recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potential downward trend.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return needs further scrutiny regarding its calculation methodology.  Further investigation into specific market conditions and MSFT's strategic initiatives is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The data provided needs clarification on some duplicate entries and explanation of the calculation methods used for some metrics (e.g., Expected Return).
