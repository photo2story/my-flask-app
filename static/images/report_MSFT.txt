Okay, here's a comprehensive report based on the data you provided, presented in English with analysis and insights.

**MSFT Stock Analysis Report**

**1. Relative Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** MSFT
*   **Company:** Microsoft Corp
*   **Description:** Microsoft Corp. develops, licenses, and supports software, services, devices, and solutions worldwide.
*   **MSFT Cumulative Return:** 0.0
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 0.0
*   **Relative Deviation:**
    *   Max: 0.0
    *   Min: 0.0
    *   Current: 0.0
    *   Relative Deviation (% of Range): 0.0

**Analysis:**  Without actual return data, it's impossible to calculate deviation.  The report assumes MSFT and VOO returns are identical (0.0), thus showing no deviation. Once you provide return data, these figures will be populated accurately. The 'Relative Deviation' indicates where the current difference lies within the historical range of differences. A higher percentage means the current outperformance (or underperformance) is closer to the maximum observed in the past.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 587.9 |

| 2017-2019  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 1118.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 1594.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 2431.6 |
| 2020-2022  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 1750.2 |
| 2021-2023  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 2768.6 |

| 2023-2025  | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | 0.0 | 3366.5 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** All CAGR values are 0.0%, suggesting no growth in the periods analyzed, which contradicts typical MSFT performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  All MDD values are 0.0%, meaning no loss during the period, which is unlikely.
*   **Alpha:** All Alpha values are 0.0, indicating no outperformance against the benchmark.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values are consistently 1.0, implying MSFT's volatility is identical to the market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** Represents the market capitalization in Billions. It shows a general increasing trend over the years, which makes sense given MSFT's historical growth.

**Important:** The 0.0% values for CAGR, MDD, and Alpha are highly unusual for MSFT.  This likely indicates incomplete or incorrect data.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** 452.9400024414063
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 452.94, 'previousClose': 449.14, 'change': 0.85}
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 445.648
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 409.554
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 395.0782

**Analysis:**

*   The current price (452.94) is above all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day).  This is generally considered a bullish signal, suggesting an upward trend.
*   The price is significantly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating strong recent upward momentum.
*   The 'change' value (0.85) shows a small increase from the previous close. Given this small change and the lack of specific change percentage, the "변동 이슈" flag is not triggered. If `change` was significantly larger, it would suggest a more notable price swing (either up or down) potentially driven by specific news or events.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.0 (Normal Range: 0.45~0.35: Low Risk, 0.4~0.3: Medium Risk, 0.5~0.65: High Risk)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 94.97120945383686
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.0697
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** 0.0 (Indicates short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0 (Long-term, S&P 500 relative)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.0 is significantly outside the typical risk ranges. This requires investigation. It could signify an error in data or an extremely unusual market condition.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 94.97 is extremely high, well into overbought territory (typically above 70). This suggests the stock may be due for a pullback or consolidation.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 1.0697 indicates that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, confirming the bullish trend suggested by the price action.
*   **Recent Relative Deviation Change:** A value of 0.0 indicating short-term decline is contradictory to the price being in an upward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 0.0% suggests no anticipated outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, which seems unlikely given MSFT's historical performance.
