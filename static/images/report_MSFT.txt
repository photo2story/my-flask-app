## Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Stock Report

**1. Performance Analysis vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Microsoft Corp is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.

The cumulative return of MSFT is 322.95%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference is 206.5%, placing it at the 76.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates a strong outperformance compared to the benchmark.  The Alpha consistently remains above zero, suggesting above-market returns. The Beta is significantly higher than 1 (around 0.2), indicating that the stock is less volatile than the market.  However, the provided Beta values seem unusually low for a large-cap stock. It's important to note that the provided Beta values are inconsistent across years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $427.02
* **Last Market Price:** $427.63
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $421.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $428.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $427.17

The price is slightly above the 60-day moving average, and below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a recent minor price pullback.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 39.38 (Indicates potentially oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.15 (Suggests a bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, 2+ years):** 74.5% above S&P 500.

The RSI is below 40, suggesting the stock might be oversold.  The negative PPO supports this, hinting at bearish momentum. However, the positive change in relative strength and the significant long-term expected return suggest potential upside. The provided 74.5% expected return significantly surpasses the usual benchmarks and needs further justification or context. The Last Market Price of 427.63 does not indicate any significant recent rapid price changes (neither a sharp increase nor decrease).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue, however the most recent data point is duplicated.  There is a general upward trend in revenue, but EPS is more volatile,  requiring more detailed analysis to identify patterns and underlying drivers of this volatility. Consistent and up-to-date data is crucial for drawing accurate conclusions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

MSFT shows strong long-term performance significantly exceeding the S&P 500.  However, recent technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction.  The company demonstrates robust revenue and high profit margins.  Nevertheless, the declining ROE and equity warrant further investigation.  The projected long-term return requires further justification given its exceptionally high value.  A comprehensive analysis should include a deeper look into the financial statements, competitive landscape, and potential future growth drivers to confirm the exceptionally optimistic long-term projection.  The inconsistency and irregularities within the provided data (duplicate entry, unusually low Beta values) raise concerns regarding data reliability.  More thorough and consistent data is crucial for a robust and reliable analysis.
