**2. Recent Price Movement:**

MSFT's price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  The recent price change (-$0.90) shows a slight decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

MSFT has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action suggests a short-term downturn, technical indicators like RSI suggest potential oversold conditions. The strong financial fundamentals and high projected long-term returns are positive signs. However, it's crucial to consider the recent price drop and potential volatility before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data point is necessary. The high expected return should be viewed with caution given its projective nature and the inherent volatility of the market.  A thorough risk assessment is essential before investing.
