## Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Microsoft Corp is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis is required to determine the sustainability of this performance.


**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (MSFT):** 287.12%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 112.87%
* **Return Difference:** 174.3%  (This represents the difference between MSFT's and VOO's cumulative returns. The relative divergence shows MSFT's performance is at the 65.4th percentile of its historical range against VOO,  not necessarily 65.4% better.)

The provided alpha and beta data reveals that Microsoft has consistently outperformed the market (positive alpha) with higher volatility (beta > 1, except for some periods).  The rising market capitalization (Cap(B)) signifies the company's growth over the years. Note that while alpha is positive, a higher beta suggests a proportionally larger price fluctuation depending on the market's performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $392.53
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $400.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $408.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $425.49

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change (-$1.80 or -0.45%)  indicates a minor daily dip.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 28.02 (Suggests oversold conditions, but requires cautious interpretation.  Oversold conditions don't guarantee immediate price reversal).
* **PPO:** -0.33 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum).
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** -4.9% (Indicates a recent short-term downtrend in relative performance against the benchmark).
* **Expected Return:** 105.0% (This represents a significant long-term (2+ years) outperformance expectation versus the S&P 500, assuming continued strong performance.  However, this is a projection and doesn't guarantee future results).

The significant price drop from the previous close warrants attention. While the RSI indicates oversold conditions, it's crucial to consider other factors before interpreting this as a buying opportunity. The negative PPO reinforces the short-term bearish momentum.
