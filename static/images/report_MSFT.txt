Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

| 2025-04-30 | 3.47 | 70.07     |
| 2025-01-29 | 3.24 | 69.63     |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Microsoft shows strong financial fundamentals, consistent revenue growth, and high profit margins.  While the recent price action indicates potential for short-term gains,  the significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the longer term (as suggested by the historical data and projected return) warrants further investigation.  However, remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. The relatively high beta suggests higher volatility than the overall market, a factor to consider in investment decisions.  The inconsistent alpha values across the years warrant attention, requiring a deeper dive into the underlying drivers of these fluctuations.  Clarification on the duplicate earnings data points is also crucial for a thorough analysis.  A comprehensive analysis should include a consideration of current market conditions, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects.
