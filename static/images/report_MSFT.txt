**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $366.82
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $370.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $376.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $394.05

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change of $2.14 (from $359.12) shows a small upward movement.  This is not a significant price movement on its own.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.42 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.15 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.7% (Short-term downward trend)

The technical indicators point towards a bearish sentiment.  The low RSI and negative PPO values, coupled with the negative relative divergence change and the price being below the moving averages, reinforce this bearish outlook.  The relatively small price change isn't sufficient to alter this conclusion significantly.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-01-29 | 3.24 | $69.63B     |

| 2024-01-30 | 2.94 | $62.02B     |
| 2025-01-29 | 2.94 | $62.02B     | *(Note: Duplicate entry. Likely a data error)*


Revenue shows a general upward trend, though there's some fluctuation.  EPS also shows some fluctuation, making it difficult to establish a clear trend. The duplicate entry needs clarification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Microsoft has historically outperformed the S&P 500, though the current relative divergence suggests this is not unusually high relative to its past performance. While the company shows strong financial performance with increasing revenue and consistent high profit margins, current technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) suggest a bearish short-term outlook. The long-term expected return of 217.6% (relative to the S&P 500) is a significant positive indicator for long-term investors. However, investors should carefully consider the current bearish signals before making investment decisions.  Clarification on the duplicated earnings data entry is crucial for a more thorough analysis.
