## Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Stock Review

**0) Overview:** Microsoft Corp is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Microsoft's cumulative return (111.27%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (58.54%). The difference is 52.7%, placing it at the 30.5th percentile of its historical range (max: 198.2%, min: -11.1%). This indicates a relatively strong outperformance compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals a mixed picture. While Alpha (which measures excess return over the benchmark) is generally positive, indicating outperformance, it fluctuates significantly.  Beta (which measures volatility relative to the market) also shows some volatility. Importantly,  the very recent period (2022-2025) shows negative CAGR and high Beta, suggesting increased risk and underperformance against the market recently.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the years reflects the company's growth.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 70.0% | 57.2% | 0.1 | 0.1 | 588.1 |
| 2016-2018  | 36.0% | 68.4% | 0.3 | 0.3 | 710.4 |
| 2017-2019  | 91.0% | 68.4% | 0.4 | 0.4 | 1119.2 |
| 2018-2020  | 95.0% | 68.4% | 0.2 | 0.2 | 1595.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 200.0% | 61.4% | 0.2 | 0.2 | 2432.5 |
| 2020-2022  | -28.0% | 67.4% | 0.2 | 0.2 | 1750.8 |
| 2021-2023  | -17.0% | 70.7% | 0.7 | 0.7 | 2769.6 |
| 2022-2024  | -63.0% | 71.8% | 0.7 | 0.7 | 3127.6 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 364.4586
* **Last Market Price:** 364.675
* **5-day Moving Average:** 372.3477
* **20-day Moving Average:** 382.6954
* **60-day Moving Average:** 403.0776

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent increase of 1.9% from previous close might be a temporary bounce or beginning of a trend reversal. Further observation is needed.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)  This suggests caution.
* **RSI:** 36.06 (Below 40, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.4551 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +3.1 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 184.9%  This indicates a significant potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.  However, the high Market Risk Indicator suggests this prediction should be treated with caution, and the recent negative CAGR supports this concern. The recent price increase of 1.9% might be a brief rebound within a longer-term downtrend.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Revenue shows a general upward trend, although there is some fluctuation. EPS also shows an upward trend, reaching a peak in October 2024.  More data is needed to confirm whether the recent increase in revenue and EPS is sustainable.

**6) Summary:**

Microsoft has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong growth and high profitability. However, recent data (2022-2025) indicates a period of underperformance and increased risk (High MRI, negative CAGR). While long-term projections suggest significant potential returns,  the current market situation warrants caution.  The relatively low RSI suggests the stock may be oversold, potentially presenting a buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance.  Close monitoring of market trends and further financial data analysis is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The recent price increase should be viewed in the context of this larger trend of underperformance.
