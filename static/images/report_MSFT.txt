## Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Microsoft (MSFT), a multinational technology company developing, manufacturing, licensing, supporting, and selling computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.  The cumulative return for MSFT is 342.44%, while VOO's is 122.83%. This results in a difference of 219.6 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 81.3% indicates MSFT's performance is substantially higher than the S&P 500 compared to its historical range of outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for MSFT across various periods, ranging from 32% to 252%.  The Alpha is consistently positive (0.2), indicating outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The Beta is also consistently high (around 0.2), suggesting MSFT's returns are more volatile than the market.  However, the consistently positive alpha demonstrates that this volatility has been rewarded with above-market returns.  Note that the Beta value appears unusually low for MSFT; this warrants further investigation into the calculation methodology.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values highlight periods of significant price drops, although they haven't consistently prevented long-term gains.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $446.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $435.00
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $427.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $428.10

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The recent price change of $0.11 (0.02% increase from the previous close) is minimal and doesn't signal a significant price surge or drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 69.60  (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term correction)
* **PPO:** 0.58 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.9% (Positive short-term divergence)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 65.7% (This represents significantly higher than market returns)

The RSI value is close to the overbought level, which could indicate a short-term pullback is possible, although it does not invalidate the long-term bullish outlook. The positive PPO reinforces the upward momentum, while the positive relative divergence suggests further upside potential in the short-term.  The projected long-term expected return of 65.7% over the S&P 500 is substantial.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows generally increasing revenue and EPS (earnings per share). There's some slight quarter-to-quarter fluctuation, but the overall trend is positive.  However, the data entry for 2024-10-30 is duplicated, which needs clarification.

|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 3.32 | $65.58B       |

Both revenue and profitability indicators (Revenue, Profit Margin, Equity, ROE) show a positive trend for Microsoft.  The Profit Margin is consistently high, indicating efficient operations.  The Equity and ROE (Return on Equity) also demonstrate strong financial health and increasing shareholder value. The slight dip in Q4 2023 for ROE may warrant further investigation into underlying causes.  However, the trend is definitively positive.

Microsoft demonstrates strong financial performance with consistently high revenue growth, profit margins, and return on equity.  Technical indicators suggest a short-term potential correction but remain largely positive.  Compared to the S&P 500, MSFT exhibits significant outperformance.  The high expected return supports a long-term investment outlook, although the possibility of near-term market corrections should be considered.  The provided Beta values require further scrutiny for accuracy.  The duplicated data entry in the earnings section needs to be corrected.
