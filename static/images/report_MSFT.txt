Alpha values are consistently positive, particularly in recent years, reinforcing MSFT's outperformance relative to the market.  The beta of 0.0 is unrealistic and likely an error in the provided data; a beta of 0 means no correlation with the market, which is highly improbable for a large-cap stock.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue        |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| 2025-01-29 | 3.24   | 69.63 B$        |
| 2024-10-30 | 3.32   | 65.58 B$        |

| 2025-01-29 | 2.94   | 62.02 B$        | *(This line is a duplicate)*


Revenue shows a generally upward trend, although there is some fluctuation. EPS also shows fluctuations but generally positive growth. The data duplication needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of Total Revenue and Gross Profit data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  More data is needed.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

MSFT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, displaying strong growth and resilience. However, current indicators (RSI, PPO, price action) suggest a short-term bearish trend. The high expected return, despite the current bearish sentiment, highlights the potential for long-term growth, particularly relative to the S&P 500.  The missing financial data prevents a complete assessment of the company's financial health and future prospects.  Further investigation is needed to verify the data inconsistencies and obtain missing financial information.  The unusual Beta value (0.0) is a major concern and needs clarification.
