## Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Microsoft Corp is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.

The cumulative return of MSFT is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative return on the last day is 189.9%, placing it at the 70.9th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha values (0.2) across all periods, suggesting MSFT has generated returns exceeding what would be expected based on its beta.  The beta values fluctuate around 0.2, indicating relatively low sensitivity to overall market movements compared to the S&P 500.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) demonstrates strong growth, particularly in the periods 2017-2019 and 2019-2021.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures suggest manageable risk levels, although they increase with the increasing CAGR.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $414.99
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $436.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $428.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $429.13

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The significant negative change from the previous close (-6.18%) indicates a recent sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.28  -  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.0469 -  A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -10.4% - Indicates a recent weakening in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 88.3% - This represents a significant projected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 if a long-term investment strategy (2+ years) is employed. The large price drop ('Last-market' data) significantly impacts this outlook and needs further investigation.  This large negative change could suggest a temporary market correction rather than a fundamental shift.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue. While revenue generally increases, EPS shows some fluctuations. Further analysis is needed to determine the drivers behind these variations.  It is important to note that the data includes a duplicate entry for 2025-01-29, which should be verified for accuracy.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-01-29 | 3.24 | 69.63         |
| 2024-10-30 | 3.32 | 65.58         |
| 2024-04-25 | 2.95 | 61.86         |
| 2024-01-30 | 2.94 | 62.02         |


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

Revenue shows relatively stable growth, while profit margin fluctuates slightly, indicating consistent profitability with some minor quarterly variations.

**Capital and Profitability:**

Equity is steadily increasing, and ROE (Return on Equity) remains positive, although it has slightly decreased recently, suggesting a possible slowdown in profitability.  Further investigation is needed to understand the factors contributing to this trend.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

MSFT has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  However, recent price action indicates a short-term downturn.  While technical indicators suggest potential oversold conditions, the sharp price drop warrants caution.  Fundamental analysis reveals strong revenue and profitability, though recent ROE numbers show a slight decline.  The projected long-term expected return remains compelling, but the current market volatility requires a careful assessment before making investment decisions. The duplicate entry in the earnings data requires clarification.  Further research into the reasons for the recent price drop is crucial before making any investment decisions.
