**0. Key Figures Summary:**

While specific timeframe isn't provided, the cumulative return shows a substantial lead.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn, indicated by the RSI and moving averages.  However, long-term prospects remain positive based on projected returns.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison:**

* **MSFT Cumulative Return:** 303.25%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 122.48%
* **Return Difference:** 180.8%
* **Relative Divergence:** 67.7% (This means MSFT's outperformance relative to VOO falls within the 67.7th percentile of historical divergence.  It does *not* represent a 67.7% superior performance compared to VOO in absolute terms)

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) for MSFT over various periods. Beta is consistently near zero, suggesting minimal correlation with overall market movements.  This could be due to the choice of sample period not including a market downturn or due to other factors not considered in this analysis.  Note that the extremely low Beta values could indicate an issue with the data or methodology used in its calculation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $409.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $409.82
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $422.15
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $427.90

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short term.  The small positive daily change is not enough to signal a significant reversal of this trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 17.54 (Suggests the stock is oversold, potentially signaling a bounce, but also high risk)
* **PPO:** -0.25 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7% (Indicates a recent decrease in the stock's relative strength compared to its 20-day average.)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 97.7% (A high expected return for a long-term investment exceeding two years.)  This high value should be viewed with caution.  It would need to be validated further.

The relatively small daily change (+$0.29) within the context of larger trends doesn't signal a significant reversal of this short-term downward trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

MSFT has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by significantly higher cumulative returns and positive alpha.  Financials suggest a healthy and profitable company.  However, the current short-term technical indicators (RSI, moving averages, PPO) signal a potential downward trend. The high expected return should be treated with skepticism without further validation.  The provided data is limited and additional analysis using a longer time series and more robust methodologies would provide a more comprehensive and reliable evaluation.  The inconsistent and incomplete earnings data should also be addressed.
