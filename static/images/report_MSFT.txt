| 2024-10-30 | $3.32   | $65.58B        |
| 2024-04-25 | $2.95   | $61.86B        |

There's a slight discrepancy in the October 2023 data.  Assuming the second entry is a duplicate,  we see a general upward trend in both EPS and revenue, although the most recent quarter shows a significant jump in revenue and EPS compared to the previous two quarters.  Further investigation would be needed to understand the drivers of this increase.

**7. Overall Summary:**

MSFT has shown exceptional long-term performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent financial results are strong, showcasing robust revenue and profit growth. However, the current price is below its moving averages and the RSI is in oversold territory, suggesting a potential short-term pullback.  The high projected long-term return should be considered in light of this short-term bearish signal.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the drivers of the recent earnings surge and a broader macroeconomic outlook, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  While the long-term outlook remains positive based on the historical data and current financials, investors should remain aware of the potential for short-term volatility.
