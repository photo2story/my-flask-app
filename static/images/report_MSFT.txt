## Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Microsoft Corp (MSFT) is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.

Over the analyzed period, MSFT significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for MSFT was 322.95%, while VOO's was 116.43%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 206.5 percentage points. This places MSFT at the 76.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating strong outperformance.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 323.0% further emphasizes this superior performance. However, it's crucial to consider the associated maximum drawdown (MDD) of 34.7%, representing a significant potential loss during adverse market conditions.  The alpha of 207.0% suggests significant outperformance attributable to factors beyond market movements, while the beta of 0.2 indicates low correlation with the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $427.02
* **Last Market Price:** $426.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $421.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $428.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $427.17

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and almost exactly at the 60-day moving average, suggesting a relatively stable price trend in the short to medium term. The 5-day moving average being lower indicates recent slight downward pressure.  The Last Market price is very close to the closing price.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 39.38 - This suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity, but itâ€™s not conclusive on its own.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.15 - A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.5 - This indicates a recent short-term upward trend.

Given the last market price of $426.90, there's no indication of a dramatic price swing (sharp increase or decrease).

The expected return of 74.5% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 represents a substantial potential for outperformance. This projection, however, should be treated with caution and is heavily reliant on future market conditions and company performance remaining consistent or improving.
