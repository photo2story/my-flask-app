## Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**

Microsoft Corp is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Microsoft's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **MSFT Cumulative Return:** 289.95%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 104.98%
* **Return Difference:** 185.0%  (This represents a substantial outperformance.  The relative divergence of 76.2% indicates that this outperformance is considerably higher than the historical range of divergence.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows consistently positive Alpha values, indicating that MSFT has outperformed the market (as represented by the benchmark used to calculate Beta), particularly in recent years (2017-2025).  The Beta values suggest varying levels of market sensitivity throughout the periods analyzed.  The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects Microsoft's growth over this period.

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential pullback from recent highs. The recent price change of $1.14 reflects a minor increase (from 386.84 to 391.26) - not significant enough to consider a "rapid surge."
