## Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Microsoft Corp is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.  This report analyzes MSFT's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering its recent price movements, financial indicators, and earnings.  Key findings suggest strong historical outperformance relative to the market, but recent indicators point to a potentially oversold state, offering a potential long-term investment opportunity.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **MSFT Cumulative Return:** 149.65%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 71.02%
* **Return Difference:** 78.6%  (Relative divergence of 40.1% based on historical range of -11.1% to 212.6%)

MSFT significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, showcasing superior returns. However, the relative divergence suggests that this outperformance is not unprecedented given the historical volatility of the difference.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 73.0% | 57.2% | 44.0% | 0.1 | 588.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 40.0% | 62.9% | 23.0% | 0.2 | 710.3 |
| 2017-2019  | 92.0% | 62.9% | 63.0% | 0.4 | 1119.1 |
| 2018-2020  | 113.0% | 62.9% | 83.0% | 0.2 | 1595.1 |
| 2019-2021  | 235.0% | 8.4% | 161.0% | 0.2 | 2432.1 |
| 2020-2022  | -12.0% | 67.4% | -33.0% | 0.2 | 1750.5 |
| 2021-2023  | 13.0% | 70.9% | -16.0% | 0.8 | 2769.2 |
| 2022-2024  | -48.0% | 71.8% | -63.0% | 0.8 | 3127.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 18.0% | 71.8% | 16.0% | 0.7 | 2675.0 |


The table shows considerable variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Alpha (excess return over market) across different periods.  The beta (market sensitivity) is relatively low except for the most recent periods, suggesting less volatility than the market overall.  However, recent periods have seen significant negative CAGRs and decreased Alpha, suggesting underperformance against the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $359.84
* **Previous Close:** $373.11
* **Change:** -$3.56 (-0.95%)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $374.53
* **20-day Moving Average:** $383.48
* **60-day Moving Average:** $404.07

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a possible downtrend. The recent price drop of -0.95% is notable, suggesting that the market is factoring in potential downside risks to MSFT, and aligns with the negative Alpha found in the most recent two year period.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 29.06 (Oversold territory; values below 30 often signal oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.38 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.4 (Short-term upward movement, but given the broader context, this is minimal compared to the overall downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 151.0% (Significantly higher than the expected return of the S&P 500)

The technical indicators suggest that MSFT is currently oversold, and despite the recent negative news, a long-term investor might find this an opportune entry point. The high expected return compared to VOO reinforces this perspective. The price drop also points to existing issues, such as market consolidation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

MSFT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent performance has been weaker.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, while the long-term expected return remains high.  Financial statements demonstrate robust revenue, strong profit margins, and healthy growth in equity.  The recent price drop, coupled with the oversold indicators, presents a potential long-term investment opportunity for risk-tolerant investors. However, further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and clarification on the duplicate earnings data are warranted before making any investment decisions.  The high risk MRI should be considered.
