* **20-Day Moving Average:** $437.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $426.97

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-to-medium term.  The 5-day average is even lower, indicating recent price declines.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.95 (Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.61 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.6 (Indicates a recent short-term decline in relative performance)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 75.1% (This represents a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, assuming consistent performance).  Given the current price ($427.85) is near the 5-day and 60-day averages, it may not reflect a significant immediate price jump.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Microsoft has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly. While recent price action shows a short-term decline, several factors point towards potential long-term growth. The high expected return, coupled with a low RSI, suggests a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors willing to ride out short-term fluctuations. However, missing crucial context from recent earnings news and analyst opinions limits a more precise and comprehensive assessment.  Further investigation into these aspects is recommended before making investment decisions.  The slight downward trend in revenue and inconsistent EPS growth in the provided data warrants further analysis and consideration.
