* **Closing Price:** $396.99
* **Last Market Price:** $394.79 (a decrease of $0.55)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $398.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $407.90

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

However, investors should be aware of the higher volatility (Beta > 1) compared to the market.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data requires clarification.  Further investigation into the potential reasons for the current short-term bearish indicators is recommended before making any investment decisions.
