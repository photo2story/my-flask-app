**6. Overall Analysis:**

MSFT has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, although this has varied across different time periods.

The projected long-term expected return is very positive, but this should be considered with caution given the lack of complete financial data and the inherent uncertainty of future market performance.  The absence of key financial data like total revenue and gross profit significantly limits the robustness of this analysis.  Additional financial information is strongly recommended for a more thorough and reliable assessment.
