## Microsoft Corp (MSFT) Stock Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Microsoft Corp is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services.

The cumulative return of MSFT is 324.94%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 118.37%.  The difference in cumulative return is 206.6 percentage points. This places MSFT at the 76.8th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, based on the provided min/max range.  The alpha consistently shows outperformance relative to the market benchmark, though the beta indicates it's still somewhat correlated with the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows consistently positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), ranging from 25% to 114%.  The Beta, however, remains relatively stable around 0.2.  This suggests that while MSFT outperforms the market, its price movements are still relatively less volatile than the overall market.  The high CAGR figures highlight strong historical growth.  However, note the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) which highlights periods of significant loss, notably reaching 34.7% in 2020-2022.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $429.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $422.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $427.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $427.31

The price is slightly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a relatively stable upward trend in the short-term.  The 5-day moving average is lower, indicating a recent price increase.  The positive change from the previous close suggests positive short term momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 42.70 (Slightly below the 50 neutral level, suggesting the stock might be slightly oversold, though not strongly so.)
* **PPO:** -0.036 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum, although the value is relatively small suggesting a potentially weak bearish signal.)
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** +1.4 (Positive, indicating a short-term upward trend in relative strength.)
* **Expected Return:** 74.3% (This represents a significant potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), suggesting a favorable investment outlook assuming current trends continue).

The recent price increase of $1.05 (from $424.58) is relatively small and does not indicate a dramatic price jump.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |

| 2023-10-30 | $3.00  | $56.52B       | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*

Earnings show a generally increasing trend in both EPS and Revenue. There is some volatility quarter-to-quarter, but the overall direction points towards growth.  The duplicate entry for October 2023 should be investigated for data accuracy.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a generally upward trend, with some minor quarterly fluctuations.  Profit margins are consistently high, averaging around 70%, indicating strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily increasing, suggesting strong financial health.  ROE (Return on Equity) shows some fluctuation, but remains generally healthy, suggesting efficient use of capital.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

MSFT shows strong historical and projected performance exceeding the S&P 500 significantly.  While technical indicators offer a mixed signal (slightly oversold RSI but negative PPO), the strong fundamental performance – evidenced by growing revenue, high profit margins, and increasing equity –  suggests a positive outlook.  The high expected return coupled with the consistent alpha suggests a favorable long-term investment opportunity. However, investors should be mindful of the historical maximum drawdowns which highlight the potential for significant short-term volatility. Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data is recommended.
