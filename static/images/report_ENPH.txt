Here's a comprehensive analysis of Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) based on the provided data:

**0. Overall Summary**

ENPH has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in cumulative returns, but recent performance has been very poor.  The stock is showing some signs of potential recovery, with recent upgrades from analysts, but caution is warranted.  Financial performance, while still profitable, shows some signs of decline in revenue growth and ROE.

**1. Return Rate Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** ENPH (Enphase Energy Inc) - Company designs and manufactures microinverter-based solar and storage solutions.
*   **ENPH Cumulative Return:** 285.13%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 91.00%
*   **Divergence:** 194.1 (Relative Divergence: 5.8)
*   **Analysis:** ENPH has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, with a much higher cumulative return. However, the "divergence" and "relative divergence" figures suggest a significant pullback in recent performance. The low relative divergence suggests that recent performance is near the bottom end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500. This indicates underperformance relative to its past.

**2. Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **5-day SMA:** 32.824
*   **20-day SMA:** 32.326
*   **60-day SMA:** 32.0295
*   **Analysis:** The stock price is slightly above all three moving averages. This *could* suggest a short-term upward trend, but the difference between the moving averages is small, indicating consolidation rather than a strong trend.

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 54.00
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.2277
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (26 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)

    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 54 is neutral. It's neither overbought (above 70) nor oversold (below 30).
    *   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.2277 is a weak indicator that the stock might be gaining some upward momentum.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** Suggests buying with the goal of accumulating shares, but does not have a large cash position and allocates 90% of cash, reflecting medium safe investment.
    *   **Recent relative divergence change:** Indicates short-term upward momentum.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely high "Expected Return" figure is unrealistic and likely an anomaly or calculation error. Do not rely on this number.
