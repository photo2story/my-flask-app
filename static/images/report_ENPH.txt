## Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH) is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  The provided data shows ENPH has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for ENPH is 1148.13%, while VOO's cumulative return is 112.74%.  This represents a substantial difference of **1035.39 percentage points** at the end of the period.  While the relative divergence indicator suggests the outperformance is in the upper percentile of historical comparisons, the sheer magnitude underscores ENPH's exceptional growth.  The provided Alpha and Beta values in the table are inconsistent and need further clarification as Alpha values should not be consistently 0.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $65.45
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $68.45
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $73.35

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The price is relatively close to the 5-day moving average, indicating potential short-term support.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 35.79 – This suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. However, it is crucial to consider other indicators alongside RSI.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.67 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.

* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -1.3 – Indicates a recent short-term decline in relative performance.

* **Expected Return:** 24336.7% – This extraordinarily high figure suggests a substantial potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This should be treated with caution; the basis for this calculation needs further clarification and is likely not a reliable projection.

Given the current price ($65.45) is below the moving averages and the negative PPO, a short-term rebound may occur if the market conditions shift. The expected return is extremely high and needs further analysis and context to be interpreted usefully.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent.  There are duplicate entries for 2024-10-22 and 2024-07-23.  The discrepancies need to be rectified before a meaningful analysis can be performed.  A proper analysis would require consistent and complete data.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some variability but an overall upward trend, with profit margins generally high and consistent, although there is a small decrease in the most recent quarter.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable; ROE fluctuates, indicating variability in profitability.

Overall, the financial data indicates healthy revenue growth and reasonably good profit margins, but the ROE volatility requires further investigation.

**7. Overall Analysis Summary:**

ENPH has demonstrated exceptionally strong historical growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  While the RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, the negative PPO and price below moving averages warrant caution.  The extremely high projected long-term return needs further investigation and clarification on its calculation method. Inconsistent earnings data and ROE fluctuations call for further analysis and a thorough review of the company's financial statements. The significant outperformance historically should not be seen as a guarantee of future returns.  A comprehensive analysis considering macroeconomic factors and industry trends is necessary before making investment decisions.
