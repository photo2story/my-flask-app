## Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH) is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  The cumulative return of ENPH is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 1060.5%, indicating a substantial outperformance.  While the relative divergence index of 14.5% suggests a position relatively high compared to its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500,  it's crucial to remember this is a relative measure and doesn't imply future performance will necessarily continue to be this significantly above the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR data shows extreme volatility in performance across different periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $66.74
* **5-day Moving Average:** $70.69
* **20-day Moving Average:** $71.36
* **60-day Moving Average:** $74.23

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 46.35 – This indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so.
* **PPO:** -0.19 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -1.1 – This confirms the short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 23787.4% – This exceptionally high projected return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is noteworthy and should be considered with caution.  Such high projected returns often reflect high risk and significant uncertainty.  The extremely high CAGR numbers in the past should be viewed with caution.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.  

The current price of $66.74 is not exceptionally high or low relative to recent movements and doesn't indicate a dramatic reversal event (e.g., sharp rebound or crash) based on the limited data provided.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicates.  There are two entries for 2024-10-22 and 2024-07-23.  This inconsistency prevents a reliable analysis.  Consistent and accurate data is required to assess earnings trends properly.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has fluctuated, but generally shows growth in the latest quarters.  Profit margins are high and relatively consistent, indicating strong profitability.  However, a more detailed analysis is needed to understand the underlying drivers of profitability and to assess long-term sustainability.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable, but ROE has shown significant fluctuations, possibly indicating cyclical profitability.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind these fluctuations.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has shown impressive historical returns significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.  The provided data shows significant volatility, both in price and earnings. Recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend. The exceptionally high projected long-term return should be viewed with extreme skepticism.   Before making any investment decisions, a thorough fundamental analysis incorporating a larger dataset,  reconciliation of the inconsistent earnings data,  and assessment of industry-specific risks and future growth prospects is crucial.  The high volatility inherent in the stock necessitates a careful consideration of risk tolerance before investing.
