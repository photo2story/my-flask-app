**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Price:** 66.29
* **Last Market Price:** 70.24
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 63.4
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 71.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 94.14

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average highlights the recent decline.  The difference between the last price and the last market price indicates a recent decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 28.26 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.29 (Positive, but relatively low)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.59 (Indicates a recent weakening in relative performance)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 26.19% (outperformance relative to S&P 500)

The RSI indicates the stock might be oversold, potentially presenting a buying opportunity for long-term investors. However, the negative divergence and relatively low PPO suggest caution.  The high expected return is based on historical performance and is not guaranteed.

The Last Market Price (70.24) being higher than the current price (66.29) suggests a recent small downturn, not a significant crash.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The financial data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue.  There's a significant jump in Q3 2024,  but earlier quarters show lower numbers. Consistent analysis of future earnings reports is essential for a clear picture.  Missing data for some quarters makes comprehensive analysis challenging.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     | Notes                                  |
