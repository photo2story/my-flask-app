* **Return Difference:** 1163.60% (ENPH significantly outperformed VOO)

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $45.75
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $49.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $54.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $59.64

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 33.21 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -1.41 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.7 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 26201.3% (This extremely high figure needs further investigation and context.  It's likely based on a specific model and assumptions, and might not be realistic.)

The indicators paint a mixed picture.  While the RSI is approaching oversold levels and the PPO is negative, the MRI suggests only moderate risk.  The extremely high expected return requires further scrutiny.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-04-22 | $0.23  | $0.36 B       |
| 2024-10-22 | $0.34  | $0.38 B       |
| 2024-07-23 | $0.08  | $0.30 B       |
| 2024-04-23 | -$0.12 | $0.26 B       |
| 2025-04-22 | -$0.12 | $0.26 B       |

Earnings show volatility, with some positive and negative EPS figures.  Revenue generally shows growth but there's a potential inconsistency between April 2025 entries (check data source for accuracy).  A more in-depth analysis with more quarters would be needed to make more robust conclusions.

**5. Financial Information:**

No detailed financial information (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) was provided, preventing a comprehensive financial health assessment.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

ENPH has shown exceptional historical performance significantly exceeding the S&P 500.  However, recent price action and some financial indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The high expected return is questionable and needs more context.  The significant volatility and lack of detailed financial information limit the robustness of this analysis.  Further investigation is needed, including a deeper dive into the financial statements, understanding the drivers of the extreme expected return, and considering market conditions.  The current data suggests a need for caution, and a thorough due diligence process before making any investment decisions is crucial.
