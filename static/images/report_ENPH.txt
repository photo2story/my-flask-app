**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 51.05 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in neutral territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 2.42 – A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum, but the relatively low value suggests the momentum is not exceptionally strong.
