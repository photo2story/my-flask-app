**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR & Alpha:**  The historical data shows periods of extremely high growth (CAGR) and significant alpha generation, particularly from 2017-2022. However, more recent periods (2021-2025) show substantial negative CAGR and negative alpha, indicating significant underperformance.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, especially in recent years, suggesting the stock is very volatile.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, indicating that ENPH's price is relatively insensitive to market movements. This is unexpected given the large moves in price. This may indicate that the company is subject to forces other than the overall market (e.g. industry specific issues).
*   **Market Cap:** The Market Cap has decreased drastically in the past few years. This indicates possible problems for the company.

### 2. Recent Price Action

**Key Figures:**

*   **Current Price:** 32.44
*   **Previous Close:** 31.79

*   **5-day Moving Average:** 31.588
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 35.6355
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 40.0413

**Analysis:**

The price has increased slightly from the previous close. The price is currently below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, but above the 5-day moving average. This suggests a short-term upward trend, but it's still below the longer-term moving averages, which could indicate continued downward pressure.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Signals

**Key Figures:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3323 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 30.51 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.9052
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Sell 70% of holdings (Cash Ratio: 70%)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.1 (Downward Trend)
*   **Expected Return:** 52825.4% (Long-Term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator is in the "Low Risk" range.
*   **RSI:** The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, which could suggest a potential for a rebound.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, suggesting a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends selling a significant portion of holdings, which is a bearish signal.
*   **Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return is likely an artifact of the calculation based on historical data and should be viewed with extreme skepticism.

The large positive change in today's price of 2.04 may reflect a knee-jerk reaction to recent news or a technical bounce, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a sustained reversal of the downtrend.

The extremely high "expected return" should be regarded skeptically, and investment decisions should hinge on further fundamental research and careful risk management. This investment might be a good one but should be made with caution and continuous monitoring.
