**1) Return Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** ENPH (Enphase Energy Inc.)
*   **Company Overview:** Enphase Energy is a global energy technology company and a leading supplier of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.

*   **Cumulative Returns:**
    *   ENPH: 274.15%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO): 102.21%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 171.9
    *   Relative Divergence: 5.7

**Analysis:** Enphase Energy has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period represented by the cumulative return data. The divergence is currently 171.9, meaning the cumulative return difference is 171.9 percentage points. A relative divergence of 5.7 indicates that the current divergence is near the very bottom of its historical range.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis Table**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2024-2026  | 273.0% | 83.5% | 167.0% | -0.1 | 4.2 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** A very high CAGR of 273% indicates extremely strong growth over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD of 83.5% is significant and reflects the high volatility and risk associated with ENPH. Investors experienced a substantial decline from peak to trough during this period.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha of 167.0% suggests that ENPH has generated substantial excess returns compared to its benchmark (presumably the S&P 500) after accounting for its Beta.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of -0.1 suggests Enphase Energy has a slight negative correlation with the S&P 500, indicating it may perform differently during market movements. However, a Beta this close to zero suggests very little correlation.
*   **Cap (B):** A market capitalization of $4.2 billion shows that Enphase Energy is mid-cap company.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 32.01
*   **Previous Close:** 32.19
*   **Change:** -0.56
*   **5-day SMA:** 32.678
*   **20-day SMA:** 31.9727
*   **60-day SMA:** 32.092

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly down from the previous close. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, which *could* indicate a short-term upward trend, but the price is currently below the 5-day SMA. The 20-day and 60-day SMAs are very close.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Hybrid Signal Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 53.61 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.2869 (Slightly above zero, suggesting a mild upward trend.)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (34 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 27721.9 (Significant expected excess return over S&P 500 in the long term)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests that based on this indicator alone, the market conditions are favorable for investment.
*   The RSI is in a neutral zone, indicating neither strong buying nor selling pressure.
*   The PPO suggests a weak upward trend.
*   The hybrid signal suggests investing fully.
*   The negative change in relative divergence indicates a recent decline in ENPH's performance relative to the S&P 500.
*   The extremely high "Expected Return" should be viewed with extreme skepticism. It is unlikely to be realistic, but it signifies that the system is expecting higher-than-average return.
*   The recent price drop could reflect this recent divergence.

**7) Comprehensive Summary:**

Enphase Energy (ENPH) has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent data suggests a mixed picture:

*   **Positives:** Strong revenue growth, high profit margins, solid revenue, high analyst price targets (though with a wide range), and a Hybrid Signal suggesting investment. The MRI is also positive.
*   **Negatives/Cautions:** High MDD, analyst consensus is "Hold," recent relative divergence decline, conflicting news headlines (some suggesting a potential value trap), and a neutral RSI. Recent rating changes are also missing.

**Overall:** ENPH presents a complex investment case. The company has strong growth potential and profitability, but it also exhibits high volatility and uncertainty. The recent price decline and mixed news sentiment suggest caution. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and potential rewards before investing. Further due diligence is recommended to understand the underlying drivers of the recent divergence and the factors influencing analyst opinions. The extremely high, projected "Expected Return" should be taken with a grain of salt.
