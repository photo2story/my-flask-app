**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" level of risk, which seems contradictory given other indicators. Consider this cautiously.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is approaching the oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* signal a potential bounce, but it's not a guaranteed indicator.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO confirms a downward trend in price momentum.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** This confirms recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **High Volatility Reflection:** The significant price change (-7.8%) reflects a recent market reaction, likely driven by news or broader market sentiment.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high long-term expected return should be viewed with skepticism. It suggests that if invested from the current point, the stock has the potential to outperform the S&P 500 significantly over the long term. However, this figure is based on historical data and does not guarantee future performance.
