* **Closing Price:** $62.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $64.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $71.51

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price change (-$1.33) reflects a small drop compared to the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-1.0):** Shows a recent short-term decrease in relative strength against VOO.
* **Expected Return (25734.3%):** This exceptionally high figure represents a projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500, assuming a similar trend continuation. This is a highly optimistic prediction and should be viewed with extreme caution due to the inherent volatility of the market and the fact that past performance is not a guarantee of future returns.

The provided data needs clarification to ensure accuracy.

**7. Overall Analysis**

ENPH has demonstrated exceptional historical returns compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook. While the long-term expected return is exceptionally high, it's crucial to remember that such projections are highly speculative and depend heavily on the continuation of past trends, which is not guaranteed. The mixed earnings data and volatile ROE require further investigation before making any investment decisions. The oversold RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, but the negative PPO and below-average price relative to moving averages suggest caution.  A thorough due diligence process, including a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and future growth prospects, is recommended before any investment decision is made.  The provided data has inconsistencies that require clarification before a robust analysis can be completed.
