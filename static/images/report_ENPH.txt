*   **Beta:** Low beta values (around 0-0.3) suggest ENPH has been historically less correlated to the overall market (S&P 500). The recent uptick to 0.5 suggests increasing correlation to the market.

*   Last Market Data: Price: 28.93, Previous Close: 29.12, Change: -0.65
*   5-day SMA: 28.53
*   20-day SMA: 29.11
*   60-day SMA: 33.82

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a potential short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is slightly below the 20-day, reinforcing this downward trend. The negative change in the last market data suggests continued downward pressure.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Hybrid Signal Analysis**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 39.09
*   PPO: 1.06
*   Hybrid Signal: Cash 0% / Buy 100% of cash (34 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: 0.5 (+) indicating a short-term increase.
*   Expected Return: 34321.6%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A value of 0.9 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, implying a moderate level of risk.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 39.09 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), which could signal a potential buying opportunity.
    *   **PPO:** A positive PPO value suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, potentially indicating an upward trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends using all available cash to buy 34 shares. The Very Safe label based on the MRI and the recommendation to invest a small percentage monthly suggests caution, despite the buy signal.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The positive recent divergence change indicates a short-term upward movement relative to the comparison index.
    *   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return should be viewed with significant skepticism. Such returns are highly unlikely and should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.
    *   **Price Change:** The price change data reflects the fluctuations in the market price, so the price change of {'price': 28.93, 'previousClose': 29.12, 'change': -0.65} reflects a small decline.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Overall:** Enphase Energy has demonstrated periods of high growth and outperformance, but recent data indicates a significant downturn.

*   **Key Concerns:**
    *   **Negative CAGR:** The negative CAGR figures for the last few years are a major red flag.
    *   **High MDD:** Consistently high MDD figures indicate substantial risk and volatility.
    *   **Declining Market Cap:** The decrease in market capitalization suggests investor concern.
    *   **Analyst Uncertainty:** The wide range in analyst target prices reflects a lack of conviction.

*   **Potential Positives:**
    *   **Oversold Conditions:** The RSI suggests the stock may be approaching oversold territory.
    *   **Innovation:** The launch of new products like the IQ EV Charger 2 is a positive sign.
    *   **Buy Signals:** The Hybrid Signal is recommending a "Buy" strategy.
    *   **Growth in Equity**: Company appears to be growing its Equity base.

*   **Recommendation:** Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted.
    *   The company's recent financial metrics present a mixed picture. While the stock may be oversold and is potentially undervalued by some analysts, the strong historical growth figures are misleading due to the most recent decline. The very high 'Expected Return' figure should not be given much weight. Consider carefully assessing your personal risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence.
