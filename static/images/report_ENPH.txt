## Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Enphase Energy Inc. is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and energy storage systems.  The provided data shows ENPH's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **ENPH Cumulative Return:** 998.51%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 123.86%
* **Return Difference:** 874.65%

This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the broader market. The relative divergence (13.06%) suggests ENPH's performance has been in the higher percentile range compared to VOO's historical performance.  However, this is relative to its own historical volatility and doesn't necessarily imply future outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha and beta values vary significantly across different time periods.  High beta values (e.g., 23.7 in 2018-2020) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  Positive alpha values generally suggest the stock outperformed its expected return based on its beta. However, the highly volatile nature of the beta suggests interpreting these figures cautiously and focusing on long-term trends and current market conditions.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $59.52
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $61.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $77.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $99.07

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short-term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Divergence:**

* **RSI (23.26):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.  However, RSI alone is insufficient for conclusive prediction.
* **PPO (-2.32):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent 20-day decrease of -8.16% in relative strength further confirms a recent downturn.
* **Expected Return (26.77%):** This represents the expected long-term (2+ years) excess return compared to the S&P 500 if an investor uses a consistent investment strategy.  This projection relies on historical data, which might not accurately represent future performance.  The $59.51 closing price is not significantly unusual given the current downward trend.  There is no evidence of abrupt jumps or drops.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data show significant volatility:

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |

| 2024-04-23 | $0.84 | $0.55B | **(Likely a typo, considering the previous data and needs verification)**|


There's inconsistency in the provided data; some EPS and Revenue figures need verification or clarification.  The most recent quarter (2024-09-30) shows a positive profit margin, but the preceding quarters show fluctuating results.  This needs investigation to understand the underlying reasons for these fluctuations.

**5. Additional Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Shows a relatively stable revenue growth with a consistent, healthy profit margin (around 45%).  More data is needed to understand long-term trends.

* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity fluctuates slightly. Return on Equity (ROE) varies across quarters, with positive ROE indicating profitability.  The data needs further context to ascertain financial health.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:** The request for recent news (within the last 2 days) from sources like shacknews and recent market outlook from Finbold needs to be supplied to complete this section.  This is crucial for a comprehensive analysis.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also needed.


**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

ENPH has shown significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, its high beta signifies considerable volatility.  Recent price action reveals a short-term downward trend, although RSI suggests the stock might be oversold.  The mixed recent financial results, including data inconsistencies, require further investigation.   A deeper dive into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial to form a comprehensive investment opinion. The high expected long-term return needs to be viewed cautiously, given inherent market risks and volatility.

**8. Recommendations:**

The information provided presents a mixed picture of ENPH. More data is required to offer a definitive opinion.  Specifically, verification of inconsistent data points in financial performance, detailed recent news, and analyst reports are needed for a robust analysis.  Furthermore, this analysis doesn't consider other crucial factors such as risk tolerance, investment horizon, and diversification strategy.  A thorough assessment incorporating this information, along with independent research, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
