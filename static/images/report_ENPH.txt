## Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  The provided data shows significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), with substantial volatility.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **ENPH Cumulative Return:** 1058.04%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 108.62%
* **Return Difference:** 949.4%  (ENPH significantly outperformed VOO)
* **Relative Divergence:** 13.1% (This signifies that the current outperformance is in the 13.1 percentile of the historical maximum and minimum divergence between ENPH and VOO. It doesn't indicate a 13.1% superior performance, but rather its relative position within the historical range of outperformance.)


The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals periods of extremely high growth and periods of substantial decline. The high Beta values, especially in 2018-2021, indicate significant sensitivity to market movements. The recent negative CAGR suggests a downturn in performance.  The high alpha values in recent years suggest outperformance even when adjusting for market risk (Beta), though this needs to be further investigated considering the short time frame and negative recent performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $61.63
* **5-day Moving Average:** $57.95
* **20-day Moving Average:** $62.14
* **60-day Moving Average:** $66.18

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The recent price increase (Last-market data showing a significant positive 'change') indicates a recent rebound; however, it remains to be seen if this is sustainable.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.74 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold.)
* **PPO:** -0.39 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.0 (Short-term upward trend, indicated by recent relative price appreciation)
* **Expected Return:** 25501.7% (This extremely high figure needs to be treated cautiously. It is critical to understand the methodology and assumptions behind this forecast.  It likely reflects the high potential growth from a long-term perspective of a volatile growth stock but it is not a guaranteed prediction.)
* **Recent Price Change:** The significant positive change of $4.96 reflects a substantial daily jump in price; it is noteworthy and warrants monitoring for a potential continuation of the upward trend or a correction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS and revenue data is inconsistent.  There are duplicate entries for October 22nd, 2024.  Cleaning and clarifying this data is crucial for accurate analysis.  Inconsistency makes it difficult to identify any clear trend.  Additional data points or a more comprehensive quarterly breakdown are needed.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:** Shows relatively consistent revenue in the recent quarters.
* **Profit Margin:**  Healthy and relatively stable, showing slight downward trend.
* **Equity:** Shows fluctuation.
* **ROE:** Fluctuates; negative in Q1 2024, suggesting challenges.


The financial information indicates generally strong profitability (high profit margins). However, the ROE shows some volatility and a period of negative return, suggesting potential underlying issues or economic factors affecting the company.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has demonstrated exceptional growth in the past, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent performance shows a downturn.  Technical indicators suggest a possible short-term downtrend. The high Beta reflects the inherent risk associated with this stock. The extremely high projected long-term return is speculative and should be interpreted cautiously.  Inconsistencies in the provided earnings data hinder a complete evaluation.  Further investigation into the inconsistent earnings data, a clearer explanation of the expected return calculation, and a longer-term analysis of performance and financial statements are recommended before drawing strong conclusions about ENPH's future prospects.
