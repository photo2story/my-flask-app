## Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

ENPH, Enphase Energy Inc., designs and manufactures microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  However, recent performance has been negative.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (ENPH):** 926.70%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 85.44%
* **Return Difference:** 841.3%  This indicates a substantial outperformance of ENPH compared to the S&P 500.  The relative divergence of 11.2% suggests that ENPH's performance is relatively high compared to its historical volatility against the S&P 500, though this is based on a limited historical context.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent results across different time periods. While significant positive alphas (outperformance adjusted for market risk) were observed in recent years (2017-2022),  2023 shows a significant negative CAGR and large negative alphas, indicating underperformance against the market during that time. This volatility highlights the inherent risk associated with ENPH. The beta significantly increased from 2015 to 2020, indicating increased market sensitivity.  After that period, beta decreased but still higher than initial years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $58.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $61.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $61.21
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $62.76

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The significant drop of -$6.0 from the previous close indicates a sharp decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 51.62 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.0885 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum but weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 29258.9% This extraordinarily high expected return needs further scrutiny.  The calculation method is not provided and such a high figure is unrealistic and likely an error.  A more realistic assessment of long-term (2+ years) expected return requires a detailed financial model considering risk and market conditions.  The provided information does not allow for a reasoned and accurate long-term S&P 500 return comparison.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicate entries.  It's unclear whether the duplicates represent different reporting periods or errors in the data. A consistent and accurate data set is necessary for a meaningful analysis.  It is important to understand why there are two entries for July 23rd and October 22nd of 2024.  The significant discrepancy in EPS and revenue values for the same dates further highlights data inconsistencies and the need for clarification.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue appears relatively stable, although there's a slight downward trend in the most recent quarter.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are generally high and relatively stable, though showing a slight downward trend recently.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity fluctuates, and the ROE shows significant variability, with even negative values observed during the year, suggesting inconsistent profitability.  This indicates a need for closer examination of the underlying factors driving these fluctuations.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

ENPH has shown remarkable historical growth significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent data reveals a sharp decline in price and mixed financial performance.  The inconsistencies in the provided earnings and financial data necessitate careful review and correction before drawing firm conclusions. The high expected return figure is highly suspect and should be disregarded without further clarification of its calculation.  The high volatility and recent negative performance warrant a cautious approach to investment. Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent decline and clarification of the data discrepancies are crucial before making any investment decisions.  A detailed fundamental analysis alongside a thorough examination of the data is required for a comprehensive assessment of ENPH's investment potential.
