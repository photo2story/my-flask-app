*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A beta near zero or slightly negative suggests that ENPH's price movements are relatively independent of the broader market.

*   **Change:** 0.39
*   **5-day SMA:** 32.964
*   **20-day SMA:** 31.6171
*   **60-day SMA:** 32.2456
*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This might indicate a short-term upward trend. The 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA, which could suggest that the recent upward trend is still relatively weak.

*   **RSI:** 60.79 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.67 (Indicates that the 20 day EMA is slightly above 60 day EMA.)
