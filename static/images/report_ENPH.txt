## Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and energy storage systems.  The company shows significant performance divergence from the S&P 500 (VOO), with substantially higher cumulative returns.  However, recent performance shows a sharp decline.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (ENPH):** 1238.01%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 55.94%
* **Return Difference (ENPH - VOO):** 1182.07% (This signifies a substantial outperformance of ENPH compared to VOO at the end of the observation period.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 14.8% (Indicates that the current outperformance is in the higher range of historical observations.  This is not a measure of future performance predictability.)

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals wildly fluctuating performance.  High positive alpha values in the periods 2017-2021 indicate significant outperformance relative to the market. However, incredibly negative CAGR values from 2021 onwards suggest a major reversal. The beta initially low and increases significantly from 2018 onwards, indicating increasing market sensitivity.  The dramatically fluctuating beta suggests a volatile stock susceptible to market swings.



**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $51.405
* **Last Market Price:** $51.54 (a -$7.57 decrease from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $58.471
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $60.4008
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $62.1821

The stock price is significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend. The recent sharp drop in price (-7.57) points to a potential downward correction or a significant market event impacting the stock's performance.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk) â€“ suggests high volatility.
* **RSI:** 23.798 (Oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce, but not guaranteed).
* **PPO:** -1.183 (Bearish signal).
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.2% (Short-term downward trend).
* **Expected Return:** 26268.3% (This extremely high figure needs careful scrutiny. It likely reflects past exceptionally high returns and might not be a reliable predictor of future performance. It's crucial to consider the high risk indicated by other factors.)

The significant negative price change in 'Last Market' strengthens the bearish outlook. The high expected return needs to be viewed with extreme caution given the recent significant price drop and the volatility reflected in the other metrics.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and has duplicate entries. Clarification is needed to properly analyze quarterly trends.  A corrected dataset is necessary for a meaningful analysis.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable in the past year, showing small increases but considerable profit margin consistency.


**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has fluctuated, and Return on Equity (ROE) shows inconsistency, which suggests variations in the company's profitability and capital management.  ROE turning negative in Q1 2024 is particularly concerning.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has historically shown exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, as evidenced by the high cumulative return difference.  However, the recent performance reveals a significant downturn, with the price substantially below moving averages, and technical indicators pointing toward bearish sentiment.  The extremely high projected long-term return should be treated with skepticism considering the current volatility and recent losses.  The financial information reveals inconsistencies that need further investigation before drawing definitive conclusions.  The highly volatile nature of ENPH, both in terms of price and earnings, demands a cautious approach to investment. More data and a consistent earnings data set are needed for a more robust analysis. The extremely high CAGR figures in the past appear unsustainable, and the current downward trend warrants close monitoring before any investment decisions are made.
