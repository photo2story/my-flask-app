*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Indicates significant risk, especially in recent periods with MDDs above 70%.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently high, suggesting the stock generated significant returns above what would be expected based on market movements alone in the earlier phases, and recent negative Alpha indicates the opposite.

**Analysis:**

The data paints a picture of a high-growth stock that has experienced a significant reversal of fortune in recent years.

The Beta indicates the stock is more volatile than the S&P 500.
