Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH) is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  Over the analyzed period, ENPH significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a substantially higher cumulative return. While the relative divergence suggests a strong performance relative to its historical volatility against the S&P 500, it's crucial to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results.

High positive alpha values in recent years suggest substantial outperformance of the market. The large negative CAGR values from 2021-2025 suggest a significant period of underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $57.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $60.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $60.9965
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $62.4863

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price drop of $2.55 reflects a significant short-term negative change.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 29.06 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce but also vulnerability)
* **PPO:** -0.32 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.7 (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 27865.9% (This exceptionally high figure needs further clarification on its calculation methodology and underlying assumptions. A 27,865.9% return over a two-year period is unrealistic, even considering periods of high volatility and outperformance observed previously.)

The combination of oversold RSI, negative PPO, negative relative divergence, and a high market risk indicator points toward a bearish outlook in the short term. However, the expected return suggests significant long-term potential but must be scrutinized to ensure realistic assumptions. The large recent price drop should be considered a significant short-term concern.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity | ROE    |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B  | 51.81%        | $0.83B | 7.46%  |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has historically exhibited exceptional growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent performance shows a significant downturn.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, although the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions. The extremely high expected return requires further investigation and clarification.  Inconsistencies in the earnings data and some variability in the financial statement figures prevent a completely comprehensive evaluation. A deeper dive into the company's fundamentals, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is needed for a more complete assessment. The current data indicates a volatile and high-risk investment, although past performance shows extraordinary growth.  It is critical to conduct thorough due diligence before any investment decision.
