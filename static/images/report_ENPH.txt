*   **Risk/Reward:** Investing in Enphase appears to be a high-risk, high-reward proposition. The potential for substantial returns is there, but significant volatility and the possibility of further declines exist.
*   **Considerations:** Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in ENPH. The extremely high "Expected Return" should be heavily discounted. Pay close attention to future earnings reports and analyst commentary.
