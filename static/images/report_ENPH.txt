## Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  The cumulative return of ENPH is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 993.9, representing a substantial outperformance. While the relative divergence (13.7%) suggests it's performing well compared to its historical range against the S&P 500, it's crucial to consider the significant volatility indicated by the CAGR and MDD figures in the subsequent section.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile performance for ENPH, with massive CAGR swings.  The near-zero Alpha values suggest the stock's performance isn't significantly deviating from the market (Beta ~9.0 suggests high volatility and market correlation), but the massive positive and negative CAGRs in different periods indicate extreme sensitivity to market conditions and likely sector-specific factors.  The consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) underscores the risk associated with investing in ENPH.  The most recent years show significant negative returns which contrast sharply with the earlier years' exceptional performance.

* **Closing Price:** $63.47
* **5-day Moving Average:** $65.67
* **20-day Moving Average:** $69.81
* **60-day Moving Average:** $72.45

The stock is trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 27.73 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce but not confirmation of a reversal)
* **PPO:** -0.966 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.5 (Short-term bearish momentum)

The current price of $63.47, while below recent moving averages, doesn't necessarily signal an immediate, sharp drop. It's important to note that the high expected return is likely based on historical data and  is highly unlikely to be repeated.  The RSI being oversold indicates a potential bounce, but this alone is not sufficient to buy.
