### 9. 종합 (Overall Assessment)

Enphase Energy has historically delivered substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a strong CAGR. However, recent performance (2021-2025) has been weak. The company has a low-risk market indicator and is strategically expanding its product line (EV chargers) and market reach (Japan). The recent stock price surge suggests renewed investor interest, potentially driven by the EV charger news. Analyst opinions are mixed, with a "Hold" consensus and a wide range of target prices. The financial data reveals fluctuating revenue and profit margins, with a mixed ROE.

**Recommendation:** Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted. The recent positive price movement and expansion plans are encouraging, but the underperformance in recent years and the "Hold" analyst consensus suggest that investors should carefully weigh the risks and potential rewards before investing in ENPH. Monitor upcoming earnings reports and further news developments closely.
