* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $63.86
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $67.41

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The significant drop in the last market price warrants further investigation into potential market triggers for this decline.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (33.8):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce back, but it does not guarantee an upward trend.
* **PPO (-0.56):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (-1.7):**  Short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return (28236.9%):**  This extremely high projected return needs further context. Such high returns are rarely achieved, and this figure should be treated with extreme skepticism without a clear explanation of the methodology used to derive it. It's likely this refers to past performance which is not indicative of future results.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly but shows signs of a recent downturn.  The substantial drop in the last market price, combined with bearish technical indicators and inconsistent financial information (requiring clarification), paints a mixed picture. While the oversold RSI suggests potential short-term recovery, the underlying trend requires further investigation.  The high beta values highlight the substantial risk involved in investing in ENPH.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough examination of the duplicated earnings data, a more detailed understanding of the methodologies used to arrive at the "Expected Return," and an analysis of the reasons for the recent sharp price drop are crucial.  The long-term outlook depends on the company's ability to navigate current market challenges and maintain profitability.
