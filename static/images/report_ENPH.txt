## Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  This report analyzes ENPH's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering various financial metrics, technical indicators, and recent earnings data.  ENPH has significantly outperformed VOO historically, but recent performance shows a decline.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ENPH's cumulative return is significantly higher than VOO's (1084.49% vs 120.25%). The current relative divergence of 13.3% suggests ENPH is currently performing better than a large portion of its historical performance range relative to the VOO.  However, this is a snapshot; considering the significant volatility observed in the Alpha/Beta table below, this outperformance may not be consistent.

The high CAGR values in the earlier years contrast sharply with the massive negative CAGRs in recent years, demonstrating substantial volatility.  The high Beta values suggest ENPH is significantly more volatile than the market (VOO). The Alpha values demonstrate inconsistent outperformance relative to the market, again highlighting the volatility.  Note that missing capitalization data limits a fuller interpretation.
