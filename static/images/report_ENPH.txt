**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Early periods show significant growth, but recent periods show sharp negative returns, indicating a significant downturn in performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD remains high (72.2% to 83.5%), indicating significant risk and volatility.

*   **Beta:** The beta is relatively low (around 0.0 to 0.5), suggesting that ENPH's price is not strongly correlated with the overall market, and has been increasing recently.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has varied significantly over the years, peaking in 2020-2022 and decreasing to 3.5B in 2023-2025, which is a reflection of the company's growth and subsequent decline.

*   **5-day Moving Average:** 27.014
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 30.1238
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 34.7886

**Analysis:** The stock price experienced a 3.1% increase today. The current price is below all moving averages (5, 20, and 60 day), indicating a potential downtrend. The 5-day moving average is closest to the current price, suggesting a possible stabilization or short-term rebound.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 41.38
*   **PPO:** -1.16
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.5 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 35041.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A MRI of 0.8 suggests medium investment risk, leaning towards the higher end of the risk spectrum.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 41.38 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of -1.16 suggests the price is below the moving average, confirming a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying with all available cash, considering it a very safe investment. This seems contradictory to the rest of the analysis, and the signal's high MRI might not be reliable.
*   **Delta:** A negative delta in relative divergence indicates a short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return (35041.6%) should be viewed with extreme skepticism. Such high returns are unlikely and could be due to a flaw in the model or overly optimistic assumptions.
*   **Recent Price Change:** The 3.1% positive price change could be a short-term fluctuation, but it doesn't fundamentally alter the overall negative trend indicated by other factors.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Safe Harbor Agreements:** Multiple news items focus on Enphase signing new "Safe Harbor Agreements." These agreements likely allow partners to purchase Enphase products in advance to qualify for tax credits. This is a positive sign of continued demand and strategic partnerships.
*   **Q3 Results & Q4 Guidance:** Strong Q3 results are mentioned, but also softened demand in Europe and lower Q4 guidance. This suggests potential headwinds in the near term.
*   **Analyst Report (Morningstar):**  This report could offer more in-depth insights into the company's financial health and future prospects.
*   **Questionable Fundamentals:** One article highlights concerns about the fundamentals of some Wall Street favorite stocks, including Enphase. This suggests that investors should be cautious and conduct thorough due diligence.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 2.88 (~Hold)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 30
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 38.85 / 85.00 / 26.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," with a mean rating around 2.88. The average target price is $38.85, significantly higher than the current price, but there's a wide range in target prices ($26.00 to $85.00), indicating uncertainty among analysts.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|

| 2025-07-22 | 0.28 | 0.36 B$    |
| 2025-04-22 | 0.23 | 0.36 B$    |
| 2024-10-22 | 0.34 | 0.38 B$    |
| 2025-10-28 | 0.34 | 0.38 B$    |

**Analysis:** The EPS (Earnings Per Share) and Revenue data show mixed results.  The recent EPS of 0.51 B$ is higher than previous quarters, but revenue is not significantly increasing. It's important to compare these figures to previous years and analyst expectations to assess performance accurately.  The repetition of the last row (2025-10-28) is a data error and should be corrected.

**7. Overall Summary and Conclusion**

Enphase Energy has experienced significant growth in the past but is currently facing headwinds.

*   **Mixed Signals:** While past performance significantly outperformed the S&P 500, recent performance has been weak, reflected in negative CAGR, large negative alphas, and a short-term downward trend.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Analyst opinions are mixed, with a "Hold" consensus but a wide range of target prices.
*   **Positive Factors:** The company is still signing safe harbor agreements, indicating continued demand, but Europe's demand is softening. Profit margins remain relatively strong.
*   **Key Concerns:**  High MDD values point to continued volatility. The fundamentals are being questioned in some reports, warranting caution.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, a neutral to cautious stance is warranted. The recent price increase should be regarded with caution, as the overall trend seems negative. Any investment decision should be based on further research, considering the potential for continued volatility and the risks associated with the changing market conditions for solar energy. The extremely high "expected return" figure is likely unreliable and should not be a primary factor in decision-making.
