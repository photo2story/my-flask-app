## Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

ENPH, Enphase Energy Inc., is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  The provided data reveals significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), but with considerable volatility.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **ENPH Cumulative Return:** 987.20%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 108.99%
* **Return Difference:** 878.20% (This represents a substantial outperformance of ENPH compared to VOO)
* **Relative Divergence:** 12.2% (Indicates that the current outperformance is in the relatively lower range of historical divergences between ENPH and VOO. This should not be interpreted as a measure of the likelihood of further gains or losses.)

The alpha and beta analysis shows high volatility and significant periods of both extreme gains and losses. The high beta values (especially during 2018-2021) indicate high sensitivity to market movements. The fluctuating alpha suggests periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. The recent negative CAGR values from 2021-2025 highlight considerable recent price declines.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $57.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $58.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $63.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $66.78

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible bearish trend.  The recent price increase from previous close ($52.87) to current price ($57.86) is a 9.4% increase, indicating a recent price jump.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 41.46 (Slightly below 50, suggesting slightly bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -1.33 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7% (Indicates a recent decrease in relative performance versus the market.)
* **Expected Return:** 27880.5% (This extremely high figure, based on the long-term historical outperformance, is likely unrealistic without context.  It requires further investigation of the calculation methodology, which is not provided. Risk should be considered heavily before investing based on this figure.)
The large price change of 9.4% reflects the recent rapid price increase, potentially requiring further analysis of news and market events.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicate entries for the same dates, making reliable analysis difficult. The variation in EPS and revenue between identical date entries (e.g. 2024-10-22) is striking. Clarification and corrections are needed to provide a meaningful analysis.

**5) Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has generally been stable over the last four quarters, with a slight uptick, while profit margins are stable but show a very slightly downward trend.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity levels have fluctuated recently, while Return on Equity (ROE) shows considerable variability, including a negative value in Q1 2024, suggesting potential financial concerns.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has shown exceptional historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, largely due to the significant growth in the renewable energy sector. However,  recent performance has been significantly weaker. The provided data shows a high-growth, high-risk investment with considerable volatility. The conflicting and incomplete earnings data requires clarification. The exceptionally high "expected return" requires substantial scrutiny and contextualization to assess its validity.  Before investing, a thorough investigation into the underlying reasons for recent price declines and the accuracy of the provided financial information is crucial.  The high beta suggests a careful consideration of broader market conditions.  Furthermore, the inconsistency of the earnings data significantly undermines the reliability of the analysis.
