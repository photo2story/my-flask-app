| Year       | CAGR       | MDD        | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------------|------------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 29.0%      | 69.0%      | -3.0% | 0.3   |        |

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $52.54
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $52.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $57.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $60.61

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase (+$1.53) is a positive short-term sign, but needs to be considered in light of the larger downward trend indicated by the moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.6 (Below 30 suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.84 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 24884.0% (This extraordinarily high number requires further scrutiny.  It likely reflects the high volatility and potential for significant growth in the sector but should be treated with caution due to inherent uncertainty).


The combination of a low RSI, negative PPO, and price below moving averages suggests a bearish short-term outlook. However, the positive relative divergence change and high expected return suggest long-term potential.  The recent price increase of $1.53, while positive, is not significant enough to signal a major reversal.

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There's a mix of positive and negative EPS and revenue growth.  Further analysis, including comparison to previous periods and industry benchmarks, is required for a comprehensive evaluation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has demonstrated remarkable growth in the past, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent performance shows high volatility and a potential downward trend. While the long-term expected return is substantial, the high risk and recent negative performance must be considered.  The financial statements reflect fluctuating profitability and equity, suggesting considerable risk. Investors should carefully weigh the potential for high returns against the inherent volatility and risk before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence, including a deeper analysis of industry trends and competitor performance, is strongly recommended.  The apparent duplicate data points in the earnings data require clarification.
