**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Enphase Energy Inc. is a leading microinverter-based solar and storage system provider.  The cumulative return of ENPH (1110.23%) drastically outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (121.84%) over the analyzed period.

However, the recent years (2021-2025) show substantially negative CAGR, suggesting significant downturn. This volatility requires caution and thorough risk assessment.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent.  There are duplicate entries for 2024-10-22 and 2024-07-23 with conflicting EPS and Revenue figures.  This inconsistency makes a reliable analysis impossible without clarification on the correct data points.


| Date        | EPS   | Revenue     |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-10-22  | 0.34  | 0.38 B$     |
| 2024-07-23  | 0.08  | 0.30 B$     |
| 2024-04-23  | -0.12 | 0.26 B$     |

| 2024-07-23  | 1.15  | 0.71 B$     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits the ability to conduct a comprehensive financial analysis.  Key financial ratios and profitability metrics cannot be calculated without this crucial information.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has historically shown exceptionally strong performance compared to the S&P 500, particularly between 2017 and 2022. However, recent years show a sharp decline.  The high volatility, as evidenced by the alpha and beta analysis and the large swings in CAGR, indicates substantial risk.  The inconsistent earnings data and lack of essential financial information prevent a complete assessment of the company's financial health and future prospects.  The extremely high projected return needs further context and verification.  Before making any investment decision, further investigation into the data discrepancies and a detailed financial analysis using complete and reliable data are strongly recommended.  Consider consulting with a financial advisor.
