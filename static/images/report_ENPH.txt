**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

The table shows wildly fluctuating performance, with extremely high growth followed by substantial declines.  The beta also increased and then decreased, showing changing sensitivity to market movements.  The missing capitalization data ("Cap(B)") prevents a complete picture.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The recent price increase (Last-market) suggests a potential bounce, but the overall trend remains bearish.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (33.21):** Suggests the stock may be oversold, potentially signaling a short-term bounce.
* **PPO (-1.41):** Indicates negative momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (-0.7):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative strength compared to the benchmark.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):**  0.4053 indicates a medium risk level.
* **Last-market data:** A 2.27 price increase shows a small positive change that may be insufficient to alter the overall bearish short-term outlook.
* **Expected Return:** The extremely high projected return (26201.3%) needs to be viewed with extreme caution.  Such high projections usually aren't reliable and require detailed justification.  Given the volatility and recent losses, this figure should be treated with skepticism.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue      |
