**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR Fluctuations:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is highly volatile. It shows massive growth periods followed by significant declines in recent years. This suggests a high-risk, high-reward stock with recent performance struggles.
*   **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** MDD is consistently high, indicating significant potential for loss during downturns. This is typical for growth stocks, especially in volatile sectors like renewable energy.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is overwhelmingly positive in the earlier periods, confirming ENPH's strong outperformance relative to its benchmark.  However, Alpha turns deeply negative in recent periods, reflecting the underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta is relatively low (close to 0), indicating that the stock's price is not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). This could be due to the specific dynamics of the solar energy sector.
*   **Capitalization (Cap):** Market capitalization generally increased during the high-growth periods, reflecting investor confidence and company expansion. However, Cap decreased more than 8 times from 2020 to 2025, indicating a loss of investor confidence or poor stock performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Analysis:** The current price of $32.22 is slightly below the 5-day moving average ($32.21) and significantly above the 20-day moving average ($30.50). The 60-day moving average ($32.45) is slightly higher than the current price. The negative change in the last market session, with a change of -3.82 from the previous close of $33.5, suggests a recent downward trend.

**3) RSI, PPO Index Indicators and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence, Expected_Return**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, indicating a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 72.66 indicates that the stock might be approaching overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback in price.
*   **PPO:** The PPO of 1.32 suggests that the 20-day exponential moving average is currently higher than the 60-day exponential moving average, indicating a short-term uptrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying 100% of cash (34 shares).
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent (20 days) relative divergence change of 0.3 (+) suggests a short-term upward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return of 26128.4% is highly unlikely.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news headlines present a mixed picture.
    *   Some articles ("Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) Shares Down 5.4% - Should You Sell?", "Enphase Energy Stock at Support Zone - Bargain or Trap?") suggest potential concerns about the stock's performance and valuation.
    *   Other articles ("Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH): A Bull Case Theory", "Enphase (ENPH) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know") present a more optimistic outlook, highlighting potential opportunities and positive developments.
    *   The analyst forecast of $29 (from Quiver Quantitative) is *below* the current price, suggesting a potential downside risk.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," with a mean rating of 2.85. This indicates a neutral sentiment from analysts.
*   **Target Prices:** The average target price of $38.35 is slightly above the current price, suggesting a small potential upside. However, the range of target prices is wide ($26.00 - $85.00), indicating a lack of strong conviction among analysts.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** The absence of recent rating changes makes it difficult to gauge recent sentiment.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출      |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-10-28 | 0.51 | 0.41 B$   |
| 2025-07-22 | 0.28 | 0.36 B$   |
| 2025-04-22 | 0.23 | 0.36 B$   |
| 2024-10-22 | 0.34 | 0.38 B$   |
| 2025-10-28 | 0.34 | 0.38 B$   |

*   **Analysis:** While earnings per share (EPS) have generally increased over the past four quarters, revenue has been more stagnant.  The most recent EPS is the highest in the period, which is a positive sign. The numbers on `2025-10-28` are the same, it should be typo.

**6) Financial Information**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
