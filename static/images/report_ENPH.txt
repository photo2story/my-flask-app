Enphase Energy (ENPH) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.  The cumulative return for ENPH is 1248.77%, while VOO's is 115.96%.  This represents a substantial divergence of 1132.8 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 15.4% indicates ENPH's performance is in the upper percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha and beta values are largely 0.0 for most periods, except for some periods exhibiting significantly high beta values.  This suggests that while showing extreme performance, the stock's movements in earlier periods were not consistently correlated with the broader market.  In later periods, the beta decreased significantly indicating a decrease in market correlation, possibly due to factors specific to the company or industry.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $70.19
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $72.32
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $72.40
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $78.06

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (38.26):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (0.38):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, though relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-0.3):** Shows a recent downward trend in the stock's relative performance against the benchmark.

The current price of $70.19 is not drastically different from the moving averages, indicating it's in a consolidation phase. There is no evidence of a sudden spike (up or down).  The expected return of 22292.9% over a long-term (2+ years) is exceptionally high and should be treated with significant skepticism.  It likely reflects historical performance extrapolation and doesn't account for market risk or future economic uncertainty.

Any investment decision should be made after a thorough analysis of current market conditions, future outlook for the solar industry, and careful consideration of the high volatility exhibited by ENPH in the past.
