## Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Enphase Energy (ENPH) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.  The cumulative return for ENPH is 1227.16%, while VOO's is 128.31%. This represents a substantial divergence of 1098.85 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 16.1% indicates that ENPH's performance is in the upper portion of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

**Company Overview:** Enphase Energy, Inc. designs and manufactures microinverter-based solar and energy storage systems.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows high alpha values (significantly outperforming the market) across multiple years, particularly from 2017 to 2021.  The beta values fluctuate, indicating varying levels of market sensitivity.  The significant increase in beta from 2018-2020 suggests increased market correlation during that period.  The recent decline in beta suggests potentially lower correlation with market movements. Note that past performance does not guarantee future results.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $71.91 (Last Market: $70.64)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $65.30
* **20-day Moving Average:** $70.95
* **60-day Moving Average:** $93.32

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend in the short-term.  The significant difference between the current price and the 60-day moving average indicates a considerable price drop from recent highs.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (32.61):** This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible.
* **PPO (1.34):** A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, but the relatively low value indicates it may not be particularly strong.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-3.4):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (16208.4%):**  This exceptionally high expected return should be treated with extreme caution.  Such a high number likely reflects the model's assumptions and the historical outperformance. It is not a guarantee of future returns and could be highly sensitive to changes in market conditions or the company's performance.  A projection this far into the future is inherently unreliable.

The last market price of $70.64 is close to the 20-day moving average, but significantly below the 60-day moving average. This doesn't indicate a dramatic price change (no clear indication of a rapid increase or decrease).

ENPH has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly. However, recent price action suggests a possible short-term bearish trend. While technical indicators like the RSI show oversold conditions, the substantial drop from recent highs and the negative relative divergence warrant caution.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return requires critical assessment; such projections are often unreliable.  A thorough review of recent news, earnings, and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The financial data shows a complex picture of both growth and variability in profitability, requiring a more detailed investigation to fully understand its implications.
