The high CAGR values, particularly in 2018-2022, demonstrate significant growth, although recent years show substantial negative returns.  The alpha consistently high, indicating strong outperformance against the market benchmark, though its recent negativity is concerning. Beta has increased over time, signifying growing market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $62.28
* **Last Market Price:** $63.97 (2.72% increase from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $62.28
* **20-day Moving Average:** $65.65
* **60-day Moving Average:** $68.84

The last market price shows a recent jump above the 5-day MA, but it still sits below the 20 and 60 day MAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend within a longer-term downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 36.50 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.)
* **PPO:** -0.24 (Negative value confirms the downward momentum.)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.3 (Short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 25920.9% (This extremely high figure needs further investigation and is likely an outlier) This needs significant qualification.  The high expected return requires careful consideration; it likely reflects the potential for future growth in the renewable energy sector but also carries substantial risk.

The recent price increase should be viewed cautiously.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and relative divergence point to continued bearish momentum. The exceptionally high projected return requires detailed justification and should not be taken at face value.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |

Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and a deeper financial analysis are critical before making any investment decisions.  The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity, adding to the risk.  While long-term growth in the renewable energy sector is positive for ENPH, the current data requires further scrutiny before assessing investment viability.
