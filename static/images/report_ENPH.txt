## Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  The provided data shows significantly higher cumulative returns for ENPH compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **ENPH Cumulative Return:** 1093.38%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 120.05%
* **Return Difference:** 973.33%  This indicates ENPH significantly outperformed VOO.  The relative divergence of 13.4% suggests that ENPH's performance is in the higher percentile range compared to its historical performance relative to the VOO.  However, the high relative divergence should be examined cautiously because extremely high volatility could inflate this number.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta values show significant variation over time, suggesting high volatility and changing market sensitivity.  High Beta values (particularly in 2018-2022) indicate strong correlation with overall market movements, while the increasing Alpha values in recent periods suggests outperformance relative to the market. Negative CAGR in recent years reveals significant downturns but high positive CAGRs in earlier years. The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values also highlight substantial risk.

| 2017-2019  | 916.0%  | 31.7%   | 885.0% | 3.5   |        |
| 2018-2020  | 5401.0% | 34.0%   | 5373.0%| 23.7  |        |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $63.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $64.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $63.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $67.75

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price change of -$0.76 indicates a slight downward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 50.5 –  Near the neutral level (50), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.6 – Positive, suggesting bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.2 – Indicates a recent short-term relative underperformance.


The recent price decrease is relatively small and doesn't signal a dramatic change.  The combination of a relatively neutral RSI and a positive PPO suggests a mixed short-term outlook. The negative relative divergence, however, suggests a potential weakening in the upward momentum, confirming the bearish short-term price action. The expected return of 25476.8% is extremely high and needs further investigation and clarification on its calculation method before it can be deemed reliable.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data is inconsistent, likely due to a reporting error.  There are duplicate entries for 2024-10-22 and 2024-07-23.  A corrected and consistent dataset is needed for proper analysis.  Inconsistencies and potential errors in this table need immediate clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some volatility, but generally increasing trend. Profit margins are consistently high and stable, indicating strong profitability. ROE shows significant fluctuations, reflecting the volatility observed in other metrics.


| Quarter | Revenue   | Profit Margin | Equity (B) | ROE   |
|---------|-----------|---------------|------------|-------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.38B    | 46.78%        | $0.93      | 4.91% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.30B    | 45.20%        | $0.88      | 1.22% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.26B    | 43.86%        | $0.92      | -1.74%|
| 2023-12-31 | $0.30B    | 48.47%        | $0.98      | 2.13% |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.55B    | 47.55%        | $1.01      | 11.23%|


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent performance shows a significant downturn.  The high volatility and substantial risk, as evidenced by the high Beta and MDD, require careful consideration.  The inconsistent earnings data needs clarification.  While the company demonstrates strong profitability, the current short-term trend appears bearish.  A long-term investment approach, combined with a thorough understanding of the inherent risk, might be considered, but only after reviewing corrected data and conducting further fundamental analysis. The extremely high projected return needs validation and explanation.
