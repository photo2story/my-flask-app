## Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Enphase Energy has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for ENPH is 1032.46%, while VOO's is 125.6%. This represents a difference of 906.86%.  The relative divergence (13.5%) indicates that ENPH's performance lies in the higher percentile range compared to VOO's historical performance, although this doesn't directly translate to a 13.5% superior performance.  The provided CAGR data further highlights periods of substantial outperformance and periods of underperformance compared to the market.  Note that high Beta values reflect increased sensitivity to market fluctuations.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $61.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $61.45
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $74.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $97.04

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Divergence:**

* **RSI (28.35):** Suggests the stock is in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-1.5):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-7.87):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative divergence suggests bearish momentum.  While the closing price of $61.35 is close to the 5-day moving average, the significant distance from the 20 and 60-day averages and the negative technical indicators points towards a potentially extended period of consolidation or further downward movement.  A rapid rebound is less likely given the current data. The expected return of 26.53% over the long term (2+ years) suggests potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but itâ€™s crucial to remember that this is a projection and not guaranteed.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue.  There is a need for more context (e.g., expected EPS) to interpret the most recent results meaningfully. The provided table is incomplete and lacks critical context for a thorough analysis.  Further data, specifically concerning the October 22nd entries, is needed to clarify the discrepancies between the two sets of reported figures.

**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable with profitability margins consistently around 45%.  This indicates consistent operational efficiency.
* **Capital and Profitability:** ROE is volatile, reflecting fluctuations in profitability and equity.

Both sections suggest a need for a more comprehensive analysis, potentially including year-over-year and sequential comparisons to understand trends more accurately.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Lack of data:**  The prompt requests an analysis of news within the last two days from sources like Shacknews and Finbold, but no such data is provided.  Without recent news and analyst opinions, a comprehensive market outlook and performance highlight cannot be offered.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but it is currently experiencing a downturn. Technical indicators point to bearish momentum, with the price trading below key moving averages and showing signs of oversold conditions. However, the long-term outlook based on the provided expected return is positive.  Crucially, the provided financial data needs more complete information and context to be accurately interpreted.  Without recent news and analyst opinions, a complete picture of the current market outlook remains elusive.  A thorough assessment requires a more complete dataset.

**9. Conclusion:**

This analysis highlights the need for a more comprehensive dataset to draw firm conclusions about Enphase Energy's current valuation and future prospects.  More detailed financial statements, including the complete October 22nd results and recent news coverage, are necessary for a robust and reliable assessment. The current data, however, suggests caution given the near-term bearish technical indicators while acknowledging the historical superior performance compared to the S&P 500 and the projected positive long-term growth.
