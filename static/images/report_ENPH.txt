## Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures:**

* **Cumulative Return (ENPH):** 1087.68%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 119.91%
* **Return Difference (ENPH - VOO):** 967.77%
* **Relative Divergence:** 13.3% (This indicates ENPH's performance relative to VOO is in the 13.3rd percentile of its historical range of outperformance/underperformance.  It's not a direct measure of superiority.)


**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Enphase Energy Inc. is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and energy storage systems.  As shown above, ENPH has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return vastly exceeding that of VOO. However, the relative divergence suggests that while significantly outperforming VOO, this level of outperformance is not unprecedented in its historical context.

The provided alpha and beta values show high volatility and substantial swings in performance.  High beta values (especially in 2018-2022) indicate significant sensitivity to market movements. The negative CAGR values in the last three years indicate a substantial decline in performance.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind these fluctuations.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $62.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $65.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.84

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase of $0.37 (from previous close) might be interpreted as a short-term upward blip within a longer-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 36.50 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions, but this should be considered in conjunction with other indicators)
* **PPO:** -0.24 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** -0.3 (Indicates a recent short-term decline in relative performance compared to the benchmark.)
* **Expected Return:** 25920.9% (This exceptionally high figure needs further clarification. The methodology behind this projection requires scrutiny to assess its reliability.  It is also highly improbable considering the negative performance in recent years.)

The recent price change of $0.37, while positive, is relatively small and not indicative of a significant reversal from the broader downtrend given the larger context of the moving average analysis.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicate entries.  To properly analyze the earnings, consistent and accurate data is required. The significant variations in EPS and revenue figures need further investigation to understand the underlying drivers.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:** Shows growth in Q3 2023, followed by a decline in subsequent quarters. Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind the fluctuation.
* **Profit Margin:** Generally consistent, around 45-48%, but experienced a small dip in Q1 2024.
* **Equity:** Relatively stable, with minor fluctuations.
* **ROE:** Shows significant variability, indicating changes in profitability. Negative ROE in Q1 2024 raises concerns.

The financial data reveals inconsistencies in the quarterly reports.  A thorough review and reconciliation of the discrepancies are essential for meaningful analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has historically outperformed VOO considerably, but recent performance has been negative, characterized by high volatility and a significant downturn. Technical indicators point towards oversold conditions and bearish momentum, although a recent small price increase offers a temporary respite.  The provided expected return is extremely high and requires further justification. Inconsistent and incomplete financial and earnings data necessitates a thorough review and clarification before drawing definitive conclusions.  A deeper dive into the underlying reasons for the recent underperformance and the high historical volatility is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation.  The significant discrepancies within the data provided prevent a full and reliable analysis.
