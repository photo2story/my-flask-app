**1. Performance Overview:**

Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  The provided data shows ENPH significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the unspecified period.  The cumulative return for ENPH is 1326.40%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 122.07%.  The difference in cumulative returns is **1204.3%**, placing the stock's performance at the 16.3rd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  While this shows significant outperformance, the large swings indicated by the maximum and minimum relative divergence (7827.8% and -86.7% respectively) highlight significant volatility.  Alpha consistently registers at 0.0, suggesting performance is primarily driven by market movements (as indicated by Beta's significant increase and subsequent large decrease).  This high beta highlights significant sensitivity to market fluctuations.

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's below its 60-day moving average, indicating a potential recent pullback from higher levels. The Last-market price of $73.61 is close to the closing price, suggesting minor post-market movement.

* **Expected Return:** 16435.2% - This extremely high expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 should be viewed with caution.

ENPH has shown extraordinary performance relative to the S&P 500, but this performance is characterized by extreme volatility.
