**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Enphase Energy's cumulative return is 1051.66%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 124.78%.  The difference is 926.88%, placing it in the 90th percentile (13.77% relative percentile) of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data's max and min ranges.  The provided Alpha and Beta analysis show high volatility and significant outperformance in some periods, but also periods of underperformance against the market.  The high Beta values highlight the stock's sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $62.4 (Last Market: $61.01)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $61.19
* **20-day Moving Average:** $75.64
* **60-day Moving Average:** $98.06

The stock is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The significant difference between the current price and the 20 and 60-day moving averages indicates a substantial price decline.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (28.61):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-7.14):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative strength.

The combination of low RSI and negative PPO suggests a bearish sentiment, although the oversold RSI could indicate a potential short-term rebound.  The significant difference between the last market price ($61.01) and the closing price ($62.4) indicates a relatively small, positive price swing, insufficient to be categorized as a sharp rebound.

* **Expected Return (26.65%):** This represents a potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  This needs further context and should be considered with caution, given high volatility.
