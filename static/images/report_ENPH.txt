## Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Stock Review

**0) Numerical Overview:**

* **Cumulative Return (ENPH):** 1246.17%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 82.57%
* **Return Difference (ENPH - VOO):** 1163.60%
* **Relative Divergence:** 14.6% (This indicates ENPH's performance relative to VOO is in the 14.6th percentile of its historical range of divergence.  It doesn't imply a 14.6% outperformance.)


**1) Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Enphase Energy Inc. is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  As shown above, ENPH significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, exhibiting a dramatically higher cumulative return.  The substantial divergence highlights ENPH's exceptional growth compared to the broader market. However, note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures show extreme volatility and periods of both exceptionally high gains and losses. While Alpha and Beta fluctuated, significant positive Alpha in several periods implies that ENPH significantly outperformed the market benchmarks during those periods (likely due to its exposure to the rapid growth of the solar energy sector). The beta values are subject to significant change.  It's crucial to interpret this data in context of the market conditions during each specific period.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 29.0%    | 69.0%    | -3.0% | 0.3   |        |

| 2017-2019  | 771.0%   | 63.0%    | 0.1%  | 3.4   |        |
| 2018-2020  | 5378.0%  | 63.0%    | 0.2%  | 23.0  |        |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $45.75
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $49.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $54.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $59.64

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.51 from the previous close may be a temporary bounce within this downward trend.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 33.21 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -1.41 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.7 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 26201.3% (This extremely high figure needs critical examination. It's likely based on highly optimistic projections and should not be taken as a guaranteed return.  High growth projections are often associated with high risk.)


The combination of indicators suggests a bearish or at least uncertain outlook in the short term.  The high expected return needs significant cautionary qualification.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue    |
|------------|----------|------------|

Earnings show significant variability. While there are periods of positive EPS and revenue growth, there are also periods of losses.  The data needs further investigation to ascertain underlying trends and drivers.  The duplicated entry needs clarification.

The company's earnings and financial statements show variability, highlighting the risks associated with investing in this growth stock. The exceptionally high projected long-term return should be treated with extreme skepticism.  Further investigation into the drivers of past performance and a deeper understanding of the current market conditions and the company's future prospects are crucial before making any investment decisions.  Consider seeking professional financial advice.
