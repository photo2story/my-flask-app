**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  The provided data shows ENPH's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).

The high volatility shown in the CAGR data (ranging from -2847% to 5401%) highlights the risk associated with this investment.  The beta values demonstrate a significant increase in volatility relative to the market over time, culminating in a substantial negative return in 2021-2023.
