## Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Enphase Energy Inc (ENPH), a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Enphase Energy's cumulative return (1222.06%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (114.36%) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns is approximately 1107.7 percentage points.  While the relative divergence of 15.1% suggests ENPH's performance is relatively strong compared to its historical range against the S&P 500,  it's crucial to note that this is not a measure of future outperformance. The high volatility indicated by the wide range of maximum and minimum divergence (7827.8% to -86.7%) needs careful consideration. The provided Alpha and Beta analysis show high volatility and significant beta changes over the years, indicating sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $68.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $72.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $71.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $82.77

The stock price is currently trading below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short term.  It's significantly below its 60-day moving average, indicating a more substantial downward trend over the longer term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.74  (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting the stock might be oversold but not strongly so.)
* **PPO:** 0.72 (Positive, but relatively low, indicating potential for further price movement.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.2% (Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** 17450.8% (This extremely high figure needs careful consideration. It represents a projection of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) and should be treated as a high-risk, high-reward forecast.)  The current price of $68.80, considering the recent price movement and technical indicators, doesn't reflect this extraordinarily high expectation. A precipitous drop or significant jump in price could be the explanation for this vast divergence.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's no consistent upward trend. While Q3 2024 saw high revenue ($0.55B) and EPS ($1.15),  Q4 2024 showed a dramatic drop in EPS ($0.34).  There is inconsistency in the number of entries for the quarters. Two entries for Q3 and Q4, 2024 need clarification.  Without further data or context, it's impossible to assess if these numbers represent beats or misses of expectations.


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals some concerning trends:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has been inconsistent. While Q3 2023 shows the highest revenue of $0.55 Billion, the revenue later drops substantially in Q1 and Q2 of 2024 before recovering somewhat in Q3 2024.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have generally remained healthy (above 40%), but there's some fluctuation.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity fluctuates, and ROE shows significant variation, including a negative ROE in Q1 2024 (-1.74%), indicating a period of net loss.

The inconsistent financial picture presents a mixed outlook.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has shown remarkable historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent price action and the volatile financial data raise concerns. While the high projected long-term return is intriguing, it's crucial to note that itâ€™s an extremely high estimate and doesn't reflect the current market conditions or recent downward trend.  The recent earnings data show significant volatility, and the inconsistency of reported data necessitates further investigation.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition, but the overall picture is uncertain.  Further analysis considering the missing news and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The highly volatile nature of the stock necessitates a high-risk tolerance.
