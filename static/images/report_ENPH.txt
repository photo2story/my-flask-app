## Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) is a leading provider of microinverter-based solar and storage systems.  Over the period analyzed, ENPH exhibited a cumulative return of 1060.79%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 119.94%. The difference in cumulative returns is 940.85%. This places ENPH's relative divergence at the 90th percentile based on the provided historical data (13.0 on a 0-100 scale).  While this indicates strong past performance relative to the S&P 500, past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided alpha values are consistently close to zero, suggesting that the returns are largely explained by market movements. However, the beta values show significant volatility and high exposure to market fluctuations, ranging from 0.3 to 35.8.  This extreme beta fluctuation highlights the risk associated with this investment.  The high beta in some periods indicates significantly higher volatility compared to the market.  The negative CAGR in recent periods warrants further investigation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $60.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $66.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $69.55

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price drop of $2.20 (from $62.24 to $60.87) signals a short-term decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (21.12):** Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce back.  However, this is just one indicator and should be considered in context of other factors.
* **PPO (-0.52):**  A negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (0.0):** Shows a recent, minor change in the relative performance to the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (26711.0%):** This incredibly high projected return needs significant scrutiny.  It is likely based on assumptions that may not hold true in the future and should be treated with extreme caution.  Extremely high projected returns usually indicate high risk.  Long term investing (2+ years)  is suggested, but this should only be with money you can afford to lose given the significant risk inherent to this stock.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicate entries for the same dates.  Reconciliation of the discrepancies is necessary before a meaningful analysis can be performed.  The data needs to be cleaned and presented correctly before drawing any conclusions on the company's earnings performance.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows some volatility but a general upward trend, except for a dip in Q2 2024. Profit margins are consistently high, though there is some fluctuation.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity fluctuates, with some minor decreases. ROE shows significant variation, from a high of 11.23% to a low of -1.74%, reflecting the volatile nature of the business.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ENPH has demonstrated exceptional past performance compared to the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by significant risk as evidenced by the high beta and volatility in recent periods and the conflicting earnings data. The recent price decline and negative technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  The projected long-term return is unrealistically high and should be disregarded.  The company demonstrates a strong revenue trend and high profit margins, but profitability and equity are subject to significant fluctuations.  Thorough due diligence, including a review of the corrected earnings data and a deeper understanding of the factors driving the high beta, is crucial before making any investment decision.  The extremely high risk associated with this stock should be carefully considered.
