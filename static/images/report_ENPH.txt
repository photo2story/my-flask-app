Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Enphase Energy (ENPH) based on the provided data.

**1. Return Rate Comparison (vs. S&P 500)**

*   **Ticker:** ENPH (Enphase Energy Inc)
*   **Company Overview:** Enphase Energy is a global energy technology company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells microinverter-based solar and storage solutions.

*   **ENPH Cumulative Return:** 283.56%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 103.21%
*   **Divergence:** 185.6 (Relative Divergence: 6.1)

**Analysis:** Enphase Energy has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. The current cumulative return is about 2.75 times higher than the S&P 500.

| 2023-2025  | -3283.0%| 80.2% | -3351.0%| 0.5   | 4.3    |

**Analysis:**
*   **CAGR:**  The Compounded Annual Growth Rate highlights the dramatic growth ENPH experienced, peaking in the 2018-2020 and 2020-2022 periods.  More recently, the CAGR has been extremely negative, suggesting significant recent losses.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown shows significant downside risk, with losses exceeding 70% in most periods, and even exceeding 80% in the most recent periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha consistently represents the excess return of ENPH relative to its benchmark.  The high positive Alpha values during periods of strong growth are impressive, but the large negative Alpha values more recently indicate severe underperformance.
*   **Beta:**  Beta is consistently near zero, suggesting ENPH's price movements are not highly correlated to the overall market (S&P 500). However, the slight increase over time might suggest a slightly growing correlation.
*   **Cap(B):** The Market Cap increased greatly during times of high growth, and has decreased significantly in recent years.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $33.0
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 33.0, 'previousClose': 32.85, 'change': 0.46} (Slight increase)
*   **5-day SMA:** $32.96
*   **20-day SMA:** $31.62
*   **60-day SMA:** $32.25

**Analysis:** The price is currently slightly above the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA. This implies a short-term upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the SMAs suggests consolidation or a potential trend change. The relatively low dollar change is considered small fluctuation.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 60.79
*   **PPO:** 0.67
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (34 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.3 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 26128.4%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests that it's a high-confidence moment to invest. However, it is important to note that this indicator is a model output and should be considered alongside other information.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 60.79 is in neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating an upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends buying 100% with the available cash.
*   **Divergence Change:**  The positive change in relative divergence over the last 20 days indicates that the stock is showing some recent upward momentum after a period of underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** The staggeringly high expected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism. This is likely a model output based on historical growth, and it's unrealistic to expect such returns to continue. It's crucial to understand the assumptions behind this number and recognize that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news headlines present a mixed picture. Some articles suggest the stock is at a support zone or present a bull case theory, while others report lowered positions by investment firms.
*   **Time Horizon Matters:** The "If You Invested $100..." article highlights the potential for long-term gains, but that is based on *past* performance.
*   **Key Facts & MarketBeat:** The "Key Facts" and "MarketBeat" articles could provide deeper insights into recent performance and institutional activity.

**Analysis:** The news suggests some uncertainty surrounding Enphase Energy. While some sources see potential value, others are less optimistic. Further research into the specific reasons for lowered positions and the "Key Facts" is warranted.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 2.85 (Hold)
*   **Target Price:** $38.35 (Average), $85.00 (High), $26.00 (Low)

**Analysis:**  The analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting that analysts, on average, are not strongly recommending buying or selling the stock at its current price. The wide range in target prices ($26 to $85) indicates considerable uncertainty about the future value of the stock. No recent rating changes were listed.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출       |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-10-28 | 0.51  | 0.41 B$    |

| 2025-10-28 | 0.34  | 0.38 B$    |

**Analysis:** This table is a bit confusing, as it appears to list the same date twice. The data suggests a general increase in both EPS and Revenue over the period shown. EPS increased from $0.23 to $0.51, and revenue increased from $0.36B to $0.41B. However, the repeating values need to be resolved with correct data to get a clearer picture.

Based on this data, a cautious approach is warranted. Further research into the reasons for the recent underperformance, the company's future growth prospects, and the specific factors influencing analyst price targets is essential before making an investment decision.
