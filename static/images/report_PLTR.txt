**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company that provides software and services to government and commercial clients.  PLTR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, exhibiting a dramatically higher cumulative return.  The provided relative divergence highlights this significant outperformance compared to its historical relationship with the S&P 500.  However, the high volatility reflected in the CAGR and MDD figures needs careful consideration.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -53.0%  | 28.2%  | -0.0  | 15.1  | 15.1   |
| 2021-2023  | -161.0% | 28.2%  | -0.0  | 40.3  | 40.3   |
| 2022-2024  | 450.0%  | 23.2%  | -0.0  | 177.4 | 177.4  |
| 2023-2025  | 503.0%  | 23.2%  | 0.3   | 197.9 | 197.9  |

**Analysis:** The data shows extreme volatility in PLTR's performance.  While the high CAGR in recent years is impressive, the significant negative CAGRs in prior periods, coupled with the substantial MDD, underscore the high risk associated with investing in this stock.  The near-zero alpha in most periods suggests the returns are largely driven by market movements (high beta), rather than firm-specific factors.  The increasing Beta indicates increasing market sensitivity over time.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $84.40
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $85.36
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $103.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $84.41

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend.  The price is near the 60-day MA, indicating potential support at this level.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 25.43 (suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -4.38 (indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.3% (short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -8.6% (relative to S&P 500). This indicates a potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, despite the current outperformance.  The recent price increase (1.17%) is not significant enough to suggest a major shift in trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Summary:**

PLTR has demonstrated exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with significant risk, as evidenced by its high volatility and substantial MDD. While current technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 and the volatile performance history raise concerns about long-term sustainability.  Further investigation is required to clarify the duplicate earnings data entry.  The high profit margins are positive, but the fluctuating ROE needs further scrutiny.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with PLTR before making any investment decisions.  The companyâ€™s future performance will depend heavily on its ability to sustain revenue growth and improve capital efficiency.
