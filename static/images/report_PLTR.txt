*   **PPO:** The Positive Price Oscillator (PPO) is positive, suggesting an upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a Buy, but the message displays as "Caution."
*   **Relative Divergence:** The positive change in relative divergence suggests that Palantir is currently performing better relative to the S&P 500 than it has in the recent past.
*   **Expected Return:** The negative expected return (-9.6%) is concerning, suggesting potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).
