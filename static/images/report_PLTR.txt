Given the conflicting signals (strong fundamentals vs. potential overvaluation and short-term weakness), a cautious approach is warranted. The hybrid signal suggests a "Buy," but the neutral analyst consensus and valuation concerns should be considered. Investors might consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy, gradually building a position over time to mitigate the risk of buying at a peak. Also, investors should monitor news and analyst updates closely, especially regarding valuation concerns and AI market trends.
