**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a software company specializing in big data analytics for government and commercial clients.

The cumulative return of PLTR (375.69%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (76.12%). The difference is 299.57%, placing it at the 94.09th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the market benchmark.

While recent periods show substantial positive alpha (outperformance), earlier periods demonstrate negative CAGR, suggesting a highly volatile investment. High beta values imply significant sensitivity to overall market movements.
