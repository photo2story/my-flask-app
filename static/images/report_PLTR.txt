Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company that provides software platforms for data integration, analysis, and visualization to government and commercial clients.

PLTR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return more than seven times higher.  The provided data shows considerable volatility in PLTR's performance, with large swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), MDD (Maximum Drawdown), and Alpha, while Beta remains relatively stable near zero. The large fluctuation of the CAGR indicates high risk associated with PLTR stock.  The negative alpha values for 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 suggest underperformance relative to the market during those periods, while positive alpha for 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 indicate market outperformance.  The steadily increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $92.01
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $80.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $86.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $89.07

The price shows a recent sharp increase (19.0%) from the previous close. The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 54.04 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.2652 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -19.0% (This is likely the change from the previous day's closing price, not a projected future return.  A separate long-term expected return projection relative to the S&P 500 is needed and is not provided).  The significant price increase of 19% from the previous close suggests a potential short term pullback might be possible.

The high MRI and negative PPO suggest caution, despite the recent price surge. The short-term bearish momentum needs further investigation.  More information is needed to assess the long-term S&P 500 outperformance expectation beyond 2 years.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has demonstrated significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, but this performance is accompanied by high volatility.  While recent price action indicates upward momentum, technical indicators suggest caution. The high Market Risk Indicator (MRI) and mixed signals from the RSI and PPO warrant a careful approach.  The provided earnings data suggests consistent revenue growth but requires clarification due to a potential data error.  Financials demonstrate solid growth in revenue, equity, and relatively high profit margins.  Long-term investment requires consideration of its high risk and volatility, alongside its strong revenue growth and positive financial indicators.  More detailed analysis is needed, including fundamental analysis to fully assess future potential and risk.  The missing long-term return projection should be obtained and included for a comprehensive analysis.
