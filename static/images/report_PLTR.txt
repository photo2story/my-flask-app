## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

PLTR's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While VOO shows a cumulative return of 24.31%, PLTR boasts a 76.11% return, indicating substantial outperformance.  However, this is contrasted by high volatility and beta, as detailed below.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company specializing in big data analysis for government and commercial clients.

PLTR's cumulative return (76.11%) is 51.8 percentage points higher than VOO's (24.31%).  The relative divergence of 52.5% suggests that PLTR's performance relative to VOO is in the upper half of its historical range of performance differences.

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals significant volatility and inconsistent performance:

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -52.0%   | 99.5%    | -66.0%  | 0.1     | 15.1    |
| 2021-2023  | -155.0%  | 99.9%    | -184.0% | -0.2    | 40.3    |
| 2022-2024  | 107.0%   | 99.9%    | 91.0%   | -0.2    | 177.4   |
| 2023-2025  | 117.0%   | 99.9%    | 114.0%  | -0.1    | 173.6   |


The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values highlight significant risk.  The fluctuating and often negative alpha suggests that PLTR's performance hasn't consistently exceeded the market benchmark.  The rapidly increasing Beta indicates increasing sensitivity to market movements.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $74.01
* **Last Day Change:** -$11.47 (Significant drop)
* **5-day MA:** $82.83
* **20-day MA:** $85.76
* **60-day MA:** $88.30

The closing price is significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend. The large negative change from the previous close underscores a recent sharp decline.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.6169 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.23 (Suggests oversold conditions, but in a downtrend context)
* **PPO:** -1.1385 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.2% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -40.6% (This is a significant negative expected return)

The combination of a high MRI, low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence change points towards a bearish outlook.  The large negative price change (-$11.47) reinforces this bearish sentiment, suggesting a potential sharp decline. The -40.6% expected return highlights significant downside risk compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|

| 2024-11-05 | $0.03   | $0.56B       |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for November 5th, 2024.  Assuming this is an error and using only the unique entries, revenue shows a steady, albeit slow, increase. EPS is relatively stable, though showing no significant growth.

Equity is increasing, but ROE fluctuates, suggesting variability in the efficiency of using equity to generate profits.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

PLTR has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative returns. However, this is accompanied by extremely high volatility and significant risk, as evidenced by the high MDD and fluctuating beta.  The recent price action, technical indicators, and a projected negative return all suggest a bearish outlook. While revenue and profit margins are strong,  the high risk and negative expected return make a long-term investment decision challenging.  Further investigation into the drivers of the recent price decline and the sustainability of revenue growth is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high risk profile makes it unsuitable for risk-averse investors.
