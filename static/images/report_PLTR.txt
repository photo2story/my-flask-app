## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a data analytics company specializing in big data analysis for government and commercial clients.

The cumulative return of PLTR is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is substantial: 447.73% (PLTR) vs. 74.94% (VOO), resulting in a difference of **372.8 percentage points** on the last day of the data provided.  The relative divergence of 94.5% indicates that PLTR's performance is at the upper extreme compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, it's crucial to remember that this relative divergence is based on historical data and doesn't predict future performance.  The high CAGR in recent years from the provided table also shows impressive growth, though this is also not indicative of future performance.  The high volatility is evidenced by the significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $79.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $78.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.68

The stock price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting recent minor downward pressure.  However, it remains above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a generally upward trend over the medium to longer term.  The day-to-day change reflects a slight decrease from the previous close (-0.58%).  This is not a significant drop and is within the context of short-term volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.57 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.95 (Positive; bullish signal)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.6% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -4.9% (relative to S&P 500)

The RSI and PPO suggest a positive outlook. The positive 20-day relative divergence change further supports a short-term bullish sentiment. However, the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 indicates that despite the strong historical performance, the model predicts potential underperformance compared to the market index over a longer timeframe.  This warrants a closer examination of the underlying factors driving this expectation.
