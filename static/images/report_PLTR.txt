**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news releases (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This information was not provided in the original prompt.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown exceptionally high volatility and significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.  However, this outperformance is coupled with periods of severe negative returns and high systematic risk (high beta).  Recent price action suggests a slight upward trend, but technical indicators (RSI nearing overbought) suggest caution.  Fundamental analysis shows consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, although ROE is relatively low.  The expected return of 31.8% over the long term is promising, but this must be weighed against the inherent risk.  More information on recent news and analyst sentiment is needed for a complete assessment.  Investing in PLTR carries substantial risk, and a long-term perspective, alongside thorough due diligence and risk tolerance assessment, is crucial.
