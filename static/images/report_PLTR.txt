**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company that provides software platforms for government and commercial clients.  PLTR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, exhibiting a cumulative return of 103.71% compared to VOO's 14.17%.  The provided data shows a large divergence between PLTR and VOO performance, with PLTR's return consistently higher.  The relative divergence suggests this outperformance is notable within the context of its historical performance against the S&P 500. However, the high volatility, evidenced by the CAGR and MDD figures (explained below), must be considered.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -56.0%  | 70.8%   | -0.0   | 15.1   | 15.1   |
| 2021-2023  | -193.0% | 70.8%   | -0.0   | 40.3   | 40.3   |
| 2022-2024  | 123.0%  | 70.6%   | -0.0   | 177.4  | 177.4  |
| 2023-2025  | 149.0%  | 70.6%   | -0.0   | 207.8  | 207.8  |

**Analysis of the table:** The table reveals extreme volatility in PLTR's performance.  Negative CAGRs indicate periods of significant losses, while positive CAGRs reflect substantial gains.  The consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlights the substantial risk associated with investing in PLTR.  An alpha of -0.0 suggests the stock hasn't consistently outperformed the market after adjusting for risk (Beta).  The dramatically increasing Beta over the years shows increasing market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $88.59
* **Previous Close:** $92.01
* **Change:** -$3.42 (a -3.72% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $81.95
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $86.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $89.45

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent price drop of $3.72 highlights the volatility mentioned above.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 47.92 (Slightly below neutral; not oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.23 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -6.0 (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -19.5% (This indicates a potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, despite past outperformance.)

The negative expected return, combined with the recent price drop and below-average moving averages, suggests caution.  However, the positive PPO indicator and relatively neutral RSI offer a slightly more optimistic outlook in the short term.  The large price drop (-3.72%) warrants further investigation into potential news or events that could be impacting the stock price.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-11-05 | $0.06 | $0.73 Billion |
| 2024-08-06 | $0.06 | $0.68 Billion |
| 2024-05-07 | $0.05 | $0.63 Billion |

| 2024-11-05 | $0.03 | $0.56 Billion | *(Duplicate entry – potential data error)*


Revenue shows a consistent upward trend. However, there appears to be an error in the data – there are two entries for 2024-11-05.  A more thorough analysis requires clarification on the duplicated data point. EPS also shows some inconsistencies.  More data is needed for a comprehensive analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|

| 2024-09-30 | $0.73B     | 79.79%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $0.61B     | 82.14%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity ($B) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $5.00       | 1.58    |
| 2024-09-30 | $4.50       | 3.19    |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.05       | 3.31    |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.78       | 2.80    |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.48       | 2.69    |


Both Revenue and Equity show a clear upward trend. Profit margins are consistently high, but ROE fluctuates.  The higher revenue is positive. However, the declining trend in ROE could be a matter of concern and warrants further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown remarkable past performance exceeding the S&P 500. However, this performance has been exceptionally volatile, with periods of significant gains and losses. The negative expected return for the next two years indicates a potential for underperformance against the S&P 500.  Recent price movement suggests a bearish short-term trend. While the company shows growth in revenue and maintains high profit margins, inconsistencies in earnings data and fluctuating ROE require further scrutiny.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with PLTR, given its volatility and beta.  A long-term investment strategy necessitates a thorough understanding of the underlying business, future prospects, and the potential for continued high volatility.  The duplicated data entry in the earnings report needs to be resolved to provide a more accurate analysis.
