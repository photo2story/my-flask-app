**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|

The high Beta values across all periods suggest high sensitivity to market movements.  The negative CAGRs in the earlier periods highlight significant losses, while the substantial positive CAGRs in the later periods show periods of extremely high gains. The Alpha near zero indicates that the returns are largely driven by market movements rather than company-specific factors, except for the last period where a positive Alpha of 0.3 suggests some outperformance. The rapidly increasing market capitalization shows significant investor interest and market valuation changes over this period.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has demonstrated substantial historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this has been accompanied by high volatility.  Current technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) suggest a bearish short-term trend.  While revenue and profit margins are strong, the recent price drop and negative expected return warrant caution.  Further investigation into the duplicate data point in the earnings report and a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals are necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high Beta suggests significant market risk associated with the stock.  Long-term investors should carefully consider the significant risk/reward profile before committing capital.
