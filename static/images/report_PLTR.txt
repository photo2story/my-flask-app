The table shows significant volatility in PLTR's performance, with large swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  The near-zero beta suggests low correlation with the overall market, while the fluctuating alpha indicates periods of both significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  The market capitalization has grown substantially.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $84.68
* **5-day Moving Average:** $87.46
* **20-day Moving Average:** $86.28
* **60-day Moving Average:** $87.97

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, the recent price increase of $2.54 from the previous close indicates a short-term rebound.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 51.26 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.05 (Slightly bearish)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -12.1% (Short-term bearish)
* **Expected Return:** -9.6% (This is a significant negative return and needs further clarification regarding the methodology and timeframe)

The technical indicators present a mixed signal. While the MRI suggests medium risk, the RSI and PPO lean slightly bearish. The recent price increase of $2.54 reflects a short-term bullish movement, however, the 20-day relative divergence change suggests a short-term bearish sentiment. The large negative expected return (-9.6%) warrants further investigation into its calculation and assumptions. The context provided only mentions that it's an S&P 500-relative, long-term (2+ years) estimate, but details of its calculation aren't given.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PLTR has shown exceptional growth compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with significant volatility and risk.  While recent earnings show increasing revenue, the provided expected return is alarmingly negative.  The short-term price action is mixed, with a recent price jump but indicators suggesting potential bearishness.  A thorough review of the -9.6% expected return calculation and the duplicated earnings data is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is needed to form a comprehensive investment opinion.  The high profit margins are positive, but the fluctuating ROE raises concerns about long-term sustainability.  Given the high volatility, a long-term perspective with careful risk management is critical for any investment in PLTR.
