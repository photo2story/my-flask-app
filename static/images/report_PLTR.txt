**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown a remarkable outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the past, with a significantly higher cumulative return. Short-term indicators suggest a positive momentum. However, the long-term outlook relative to the S&P 500 is negative (-19.8%). The company's financial statements reveal consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, yet the fluctuating ROE warrants further investigation.  The high beta during some periods shows considerable sensitivity to overall market movements.   Investors should carefully consider the risks associated with this volatility and the negative long-term expected return before making any investment decisions. Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's fundamentals, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is crucial. The inconsistent alpha and fluctuating beta suggest a need for more in-depth analysis of PLTR's risk profile and potential to beat the market in the long term.
