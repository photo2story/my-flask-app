## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

This report analyzes Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), a data analytics company specializing in big data and artificial intelligence for government and commercial clients.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

PLTR's cumulative return (430.35%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (76.05%) over the analyzed period.  The raw difference in cumulative returns is 354.3%.  The provided relative divergence of 99.9% indicates PLTR's performance is at the extreme upper end of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR figures show substantial volatility, with significant negative returns in some periods and a massive positive return in the 2022-2024 period. This highlights high risk.  The near-zero alpha suggests the outperformance may not be due to skill but rather to high risk exposure, amplified by the high beta values.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR shows impressive long-term growth relative to the S&P 500. However, significant volatility and a high beta indicate substantial risk.  Recent price action suggests upward momentum, but indicators like RSI and PPO signal potential for a short-term correction.  The company demonstrates consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, with increasing equity and ROE.  Further analysis of news, analyst sentiment, and a detailed understanding of the expected return calculation is necessary for a complete assessment.  The significant difference in return relative to the S&P 500 should be viewed cautiously, as this may be a reflection of taking on significantly higher risk.
