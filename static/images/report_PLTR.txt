## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) shows exceptionally high cumulative returns significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO). However, this performance is characterized by high volatility and risk, as evidenced by large drawdowns and a high beta.  Recent financial data indicates strong revenue growth and high profit margins, but profitability metrics need further context.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a software company specializing in big data analytics for government and commercial clients.

* **PLTR Cumulative Return:** 742.91%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 77.48%
* **Return Difference:** 665.42%
* **Relative Outperformance:** 100.0% (based on historical range)

PLTR's cumulative return significantly surpasses that of the S&P 500.  However, the relative outperformance metric highlights the extreme nature of this difference compared to historical variations.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -53.0% | 28.2% | -58.0% | -0.0 | 14.6 |
| 2021-2023  | -161.0% | 28.2% | -185.0% | -0.0 | 39.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 450.0% | 23.2% | 417.0% | -0.0 | 172.3 |
| 2023-2025  | 783.0% | 23.2% | 720.0% | 0.3 | 283.9 |

**Analysis:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates wildly, indicating extreme volatility.  The negative alphas in earlier periods suggest underperformance relative to the market, while the positive alpha in the most recent period reflects the substantial outperformance observed. The high beta indicates significant sensitivity to overall market movements.  Market capitalization has grown substantially.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $124.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $118.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $96.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $79.86

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend. However, the relatively large gap between the short-term (5-day) and long-term (60-day) averages highlights volatility.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 87.50 (Overbought)
* **PPO:** 2.15 (Positive)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** 0.0 (Slight downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, >2 years):** -3.7% (vs. S&P 500)

The high RSI suggests the stock is overbought, implying a potential correction.  The positive PPO indicates upward momentum, but the overbought RSI suggests caution.  The near-zero change in relative strength indicates a recent consolidation or slight decline. The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests that while PLTR has shown extraordinary growth, long-term investors might see lower returns compared to the market index.  The provided "change" of 0.0 doesn't indicate a significant price change to cause alarm.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-05 | $0.06  | $0.73 Billion |
| 2024-08-06 | $0.06  | $0.68 Billion |
| 2024-05-07 | $0.05  | $0.63 Billion |
| 2023-11-03 | $0.03  | $0.56 Billion |
| 2024-11-05 | $0.03  | $0.56 Billion | *(Note: Duplicate entry likely a data error)*


Revenue is steadily increasing, showing consistent growth quarter over quarter.  EPS is also showing a positive trend, though the data contains a potential duplication error which needs clarification.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.73B | 79.79% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.68B | 81.04% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.63B | 81.67% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.61B | 82.14% |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.56B | 80.66% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $4.50B | 3.19% |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.05B | 3.31% |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.78B | 2.80% |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.48B | 2.69% |
| 2023-09-30 | $3.19B | 2.24% |

Both revenue and profit margins are consistently high. Equity is also growing, but ROE (Return on Equity) shows some fluctuation, suggesting that while the company is profitable, the efficiency of using equity to generate profit could be improved.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

PLTR's performance has been exceptionally volatile but has generated significant returns exceeding the S&P 500.  However, this outperformance comes with high risk, as evidenced by high beta and large drawdowns. Recent financial data suggests strong revenue growth and high profit margins, but the companyâ€™s profitability metrics need further analysis.  The overbought RSI and negative long-term expected return relative to the market index suggest caution for long-term investors.  Further investigation into the duplicated data point in the earnings analysis and potential drivers of the extreme price fluctuations are warranted.  A risk-tolerant investor with a high tolerance for volatility might find PLTR attractive, but a more conservative investor might prefer a less risky investment.
