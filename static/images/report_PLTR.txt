**0. Overview:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company that provides software platforms for data integration, analysis, and visualization to government and commercial clients.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PLTR's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While VOO shows a cumulative return of 73.31%, PLTR boasts a remarkable 585.52% return. This results in a current divergence of 512.2%, placing it at the 79.2nd percentile of its historical divergence range (max: 665.4%, min: -70.9%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals volatile performance.  While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows impressive growth from 2022-2025 (626%), previous periods show substantial losses.  The negative Alpha consistently indicates underperformance relative to the market benchmark (likely due to high volatility and beta), except for the final period.  The Beta values dramatically increase over time, reflecting increasingly higher volatility compared to the market. The market capitalization (Cap) demonstrates significant growth across the analyzed periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

PLTR's current closing price is $101.35.  It experienced a recent decrease of $4.92 from the previous close. The moving averages suggest a mixed trend:

* **5-Day MA:** $112.69 (above current price, indicating recent decline)
* **20-Day MA:** $100.86 (slightly below current price, suggesting short-term sideways movement)
* **60-Day MA:** $82.08 (significantly below current price, implying a longer-term uptrend)

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (61.9):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining within a neutral territory.
* **PPO (-1.31):** A negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** The recent negative 20.8% change in relative divergence points to short-term downward pressure.  The significant price drop of $4.92 reinforces this, suggesting a potential short-term correction.
* **Expected Return (-6.1%):**  This short-term negative expected return is consistent with the recent price decline.  However, the long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not explicitly stated, so long-term potential cannot be quantified from the provided information.

**6. Summary:**

PLTR has demonstrated significantly higher returns than the S&P 500, but this has been accompanied by substantial volatility.  While recent earnings show positive growth and high profit margins, the short-term outlook appears bearish based on price action and technical indicators.  Long-term potential is suggested by the cumulative return, but  the provided data lacks sufficient information to accurately predict future long-term performance relative to the S&P 500. Further analysis, including a thorough review of the company's financial statements and future growth projections, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Clarification of duplicate data points is also necessary for a complete and accurate analysis.
