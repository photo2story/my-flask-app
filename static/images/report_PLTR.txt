    *   **Hybrid Signal:** It indicates that you should use 90% of your cash to buy 1 share. This is categorized as a "safe" investment based on the MRI of 0.8.
    *   **Relative Divergence Change:** A negative change of -16.4 suggests the outperformance of PLTR relative to VOO has been decreasing recently.
    *   **Expected Return:** A 9.0% expected return is attractive if the investor has a long-term (2+ year) investment horizon. However, it's crucial to consider the stock's volatility.
