**0. Summary Statistics:**

PLTR's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  While exhibiting high volatility, recent earnings show growth, though profitability metrics warrant further scrutiny.

* **Relative Divergence:** 57.5% (This indicates PLTR's performance is in the upper 57.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500).

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B)  |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| 2020-2022  | -56.0%   | 70.8%    | -54.0%  | -0.0    | 15.1    |
| 2021-2023  | -193.0%  | 70.8%    | -208.0% | -0.0    | 40.3    |
| 2022-2024  | 123.0%   | 70.6%    | 106.0%  | -0.0    | 177.4   |
| 2023-2025  | 149.0%   | 71.3%    | 138.0%  | -0.0    | 207.7   |

The high volatility (MDD) and negative alpha in earlier years suggest significant underperformance relative to the market, but a strong positive CAGR in recent years. The near-zero beta initially indicates low correlation with the market, which has changed in recent periods.  The increasing market capitalization reflects growing market interest, but the past performance is not indicative of future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $88.55
* **Previous Close:** $88.59
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $84.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $86.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $89.79

The price is slightly below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential consolidation or a short-term downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.01 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** 0.53 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -19.4% (Expected to underperform S&P 500 over the long term).  This is a significant negative, warranting further investigation into the reasons behind this projection.


The price change of -$0.05 is not significant enough to indicate a sharp upward or downward trend. The contradictory signals from the RSI (oversold) and the PPO (bullish) suggest a period of market uncertainty. The negative expected return is a significant concern.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this has been accompanied by substantial volatility.  While recent earnings indicate revenue growth, the projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-19.4%) is a major concern.  The high profit margins are positive, but the declining trend and fluctuating ROE require further investigation. The contradictory technical indicators suggest a period of uncertainty.  More in-depth analysis, including a thorough examination of the company's business strategy, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The data provided has some inconsistencies (duplicate earnings data) requiring further clarification.
