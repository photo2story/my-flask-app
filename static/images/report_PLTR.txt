2025-04-27 - Analysis Report
## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

PLTR's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  While VOO shows a modest gain, PLTR boasts a substantially higher return. However, this high return needs to be considered in the context of its volatility (as indicated by the high MDD in section 1).  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this performance.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company specializing in big data analytics for government and commercial clients.

* **Cumulative Return Comparison:** PLTR achieved a 147.68% cumulative return, compared to VOO's 20.65%.  The difference is substantial (127.0 percentage points), placing PLTR at the 72.7th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided min/max range.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high volatility and inconsistent performance year-over-year.  The negative Alpha values across all periods suggest that PLTR has underperformed the market when accounting for risk (beta).  However, recent years show a dramatically improved performance. The extremely high Beta values indicate a high sensitivity to market movements. The significantly increasing market capitalization is a positive factor.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $90.40

* **RSI:** 80.26 – This is in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.

* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +14.3% –  A strong positive change supports the recent upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -12.7% – This negative expected return is concerning and contradicts the recent price increase.  The discrepancy needs further investigation, this data is likely using a different model which is not accounted for in this brief review.  More information is needed.  However, this contrasts with the recent substantial price gains.
* **Price Change:** The large daily change of +$4.64 suggests a significant short-term upward price movement which could represent a sudden positive development or an overreaction.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PLTR shows a strong recent performance with a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, this is coupled with high volatility and a history of inconsistent performance, indicated by the large MDD and negative Alphas.  The recent sharp price increase, exceeding moving averages and RSI being in overbought territory, suggests potential for a short-term correction. The positive revenue and profit growth is encouraging, but the relatively low ROE might suggest areas for improvement in capital efficiency.  The -12.7% expected return needs further clarification as it conflicts with recent price action and growth. A long-term investment strategy should carefully consider PLTR's high risk profile and volatility alongside its potential for high growth. Further due diligence is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data may be incomplete and other factors should be considered for a more thorough analysis.
