## Palantir Technologies Inc (PLTR) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a data analytics company specializing in big data software and services for government and commercial clients.  PLTR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative returns,  but exhibits high volatility and a high RSI indicating potential overbought conditions.  Recent earnings show growth, but profitability metrics need further examination.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

PLTR's cumulative return of 154.91% vastly exceeds the S&P 500's 21.45% return. The difference (133.5%) places it at the 75.2nd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-56.4% to 196.0%).  However, the provided CAGR data shows significant volatility and negative returns in certain periods.  The consistently near-zero Alpha suggests that the outperformance is not solely due to stock-specific factors but might be influenced by high beta (market sensitivity).

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -56.0% | 70.8% | -55.0% | 0.0 | 15.2 |
| 2021-2023  | -193.0% | 70.8% | -210.0% | 0.0 | 40.5 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $116.08
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $110.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $93.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $94.23

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an uptrend. The recent price increase of $1.25 (from $114.65) shows a short-term upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.379 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 80.75 (Overbought territory, indicating potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 3.06 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +16.7% (Strong short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -11.7% (Negative expected return relative to S&P 500)

The high RSI and significant recent price increase point towards a potentially overbought condition.  The negative expected return suggests that while the stock has significantly outperformed in the past, future returns relative to the S&P 500 are projected to be negative over the long term (2+ years).

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial volatility.  High RSI levels and a negative expected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 suggest caution.  While recent earnings show revenue growth, the duplicated data entry needs clarification, and a deeper dive into profitability trends and the potential impact of the high beta is warranted.  Investors should consider the high risk profile before investing.  Further analysis, including a thorough review of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
