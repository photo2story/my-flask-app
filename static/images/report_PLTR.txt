## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

PLTR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  While the precise timeframe isn't specified, the cumulative return difference is substantial.  Recent price movements show a strong upward trend, exceeding both short-term and long-term moving averages.  However, the expected return is negative, potentially indicating market overvaluation or short-term price fluctuations.


**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a software company specializing in big data analytics for government and commercial clients.

* **PLTR Cumulative Return:** 121.64%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 17.40%
* **Return Difference:** 104.2%
* **Relative Divergence:** 63.6% (This indicates PLTR's performance is significantly higher than the S&P 500, exceeding the minimum-maximum range's 63.6th percentile.)

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) data shows highly volatile performance.  Negative CAGRs in some periods highlight significant risk associated with PLTR investment.  The consistently low Alpha suggests that PLTR's returns haven't significantly outperformed the market after accounting for its Beta (volatility relative to the market).  The high Beta indicates PLTR is a considerably riskier investment than the overall market.

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -56.0% | 70.8% | -0.0  | 15.1  |        |

The large daily price change (`{'price': 100.82, 'previousClose': 93.99, 'change': 7.27}`) reflects a significant price jump. This needs further investigation to determine the underlying cause.  The negative long-term expected return contrasts sharply with the recent short-term price increase, raising concerns about potential future price corrections.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR exhibits significant short-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500, evidenced by a substantial positive return difference.  However, this needs to be viewed cautiously considering the high volatility (indicated by the high Beta and the large MDD) and a negative long-term expected return.  While recent earnings and revenue growth are encouraging, the high risk and the negative long-term expected return suggest that the recent price surge might be unsustainable.  Further investigation into the cause of the recent price jump is crucial.  Investors should carefully consider the inherent risks before investing in PLTR, especially given its historical volatility.  The data suggests a situation of potential short-term overvaluation.  A long-term investment strategy should carefully weigh the high risk profile against the potential reward.
