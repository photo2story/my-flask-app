* **Cumulative Return (PLTR):** 170.01%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 23.70%

**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company that provides software platforms for government and commercial clients.  Over the period analyzed, PLTR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return vastly exceeding that of the benchmark index.  The high relative divergence suggests that PLTR's performance has been exceptionally strong compared to its historical relationship with the S&P 500.  However, this outperformance needs to be viewed within the context of the provided alpha and beta analysis.  The consistently near-zero alpha suggests that the outperformance may not be entirely due to superior stock-picking ability, but also potentially influenced by high beta values, indicating higher sensitivity to broader market movements.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -56.0% | 70.8% | -0.0% | 15.2 |
| 2021-2023  | -193.0% | 70.8% | -0.0% | 40.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 123.0% | 70.6% | -0.0% | 178.5 |
| 2023-2025  | 215.0% | 70.6% | -0.0% | 293.3 |


The table shows significant volatility in CAGR, with periods of substantial losses followed by periods of very high gains.  The consistently high Beta values point to considerable market risk associated with PLTR.  The large increases in market capitalization also indicate significant market interest and valuation changes.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $124.28
* **Previous Close:** $116.20
* **Daily Change:** $6.95 (5.97% increase) -  Represents a significant daily jump.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $117.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $98.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $95.40

The price is above all three moving averages, indicating a short-term uptrend.  The significant daily price increase suggests a potential temporary surge, which is consistent with the high RSI value (see below).


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 81.04 (Overbought; Suggests potential for a short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 2.65 (Positive; Indicates bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.6% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -10.1% (This suggests a negative expected alpha relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, despite the strong current performance.  It implies that current valuations may not fully justify sustained outperformance against the benchmark index.)
* **Daily Price Change Significance:** The large daily increase of $6.95 needs consideration. This significant jump could indicate a temporary surge, possibly due to news or market sentiment, rather than a sustained upward trend.  Further investigation into any news or catalysts driving this price action is warranted.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for November 2024. Assuming this is an error, the data shows a clear trend of increasing revenue quarter over quarter.  EPS remains relatively stable.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying drivers of revenue growth and profitability.

Equity is increasing, but ROE is volatile.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has demonstrated exceptionally strong performance relative to the S&P 500 in recent periods.  However, this outperformance is characterized by significant volatility and is associated with high market risk (high beta).  The consistently near-zero alpha suggests that this outperformance might be largely driven by market factors rather than inherent company strength.  While current financial indicators show increasing revenue and high profit margins, the relatively low and volatile ROE and the negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term warrant caution. The recent price surge should be viewed with caution given the overbought RSI and potential for a short-term correction.  Further research is needed to determine the sustainability of PLTR's performance and whether current valuations are justified.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with this stock before making any investment decisions.  Any investment strategy should consider diversification and a thorough understanding of the company's business model and future prospects.
