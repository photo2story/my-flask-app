## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a data analytics company specializing in big data analysis for government and commercial clients.

The cumulative return of PLTR is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 348.7%, placing it at the 89.4th percentile of historical divergence relative to VOO.  While this indicates strong outperformance, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. The provided CAGR data shows highly volatile returns, swinging between massive gains and losses. The high variability highlights significant risk associated with PLTR.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $75.92
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $76.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $76.30
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $61.37

The price is currently below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's significantly above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 49.76  (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.42 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -6.4% (Expected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term)

The technical indicators paint a mixed picture. While the RSI is neutral, the negative PPO and negative relative divergence suggest bearish momentum. The negative expected return further reinforces the potential for underperformance against the S&P 500 in the long run. The current price is near its 20 and 5 day moving average, indicating a slight dip. A sharp increase in price above its average would signal significant change and would need further investigation.
