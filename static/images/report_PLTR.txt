**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company specializing in big data analysis for government and commercial clients.  Over the periods shown, PLTR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a massive cumulative return difference of 665.42%. However, the relative divergence metric indicates this outperformance is at the extreme high end of its historical range.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly volatile performance:

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -53.0%   | 28.2%    | -0.0  | 14.6  | 14.6   |
| 2021-2023  | -161.0%  | 28.2%    | -0.0  | 39.1  | 39.1   |
| 2022-2024  | 450.0%   | 23.2%    | -0.0  | 172.3 | 172.3  |
| 2023-2025  | 783.0%   | 23.2%    | 0.3   | 283.9 | 283.9  |

The consistently negative alpha in the first three periods, followed by a positive alpha in the last, suggests that PLTR's performance wasn't purely driven by market movements.  The significant increase in Beta over time reflects increasing market sensitivity.  The highly volatile CAGR values underscore the high risk associated with PLTR.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of $124.62 is above all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a recent upward trend. The relatively large gap between the current price and the 60-day MA suggests a strong recent price increase.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 87.50 is extremely high, suggesting the stock is significantly overbought and potentially vulnerable to a correction. The positive PPO (2.15) indicates bullish momentum, although this needs to be viewed in light of the overbought RSI.  The recent negative relative divergence indicates a potential slowdown in the upward momentum. The expected return of -3.7% relative to the S&P 500 over the long term suggests underperformance compared to the market despite its past high growth.  This forecast should be considered cautiously due to the high volatility of the stock.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-11-05 | $0.06 | $0.73 B      |
| 2024-08-06 | $0.06 | $0.68 B      |
| 2024-05-07 | $0.05 | $0.63 B      |
| 2023-11-03 | $0.03 | $0.56 B      |
| 2024-11-05 | $0.03 | $0.56 B      | *(Note: Duplicate entry - likely an error)*

Revenue shows a steady increase over time, although EPS is relatively flat. The duplicate entry for November 2024 needs clarification.  More detailed financial data is needed for a comprehensive analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a robust financial analysis.  Further financial data is required.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has demonstrated exceptional historical returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this performance has been extremely volatile, with periods of substantial losses.  Current indicators (high RSI, mixed PPO) suggest a potential near-term correction despite the recent price increase.  The lack of complete financial data hampers a thorough assessment of the company's financial health and sustainability. The long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative, suggesting that despite past performance, investors should approach this stock with caution given its inherent risk and volatility.  Further investigation into the company's financials and future growth prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.
