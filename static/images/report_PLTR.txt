## Palantir Technologies Inc (PLTR) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a software company specializing in big data analytics for government and commercial clients.  The cumulative return of PLTR (430.35%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (76.05%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 354.3%, placing it at the 99.9th percentile of historical divergence relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided data.  However, this high divergence should be considered in the context of the significant volatility shown in the CAGR and MDD figures below.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values are inconsistent across different time periods, indicating high volatility and difficulty in establishing a consistent performance measure against the market (S&P 500).  The high CAGR (453%) from 2022-2024 is offset by negative CAGRs in previous periods, highlighting significant risk.  The MDD (maximum drawdown) also demonstrates significant periods of price decline.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -53.0%  | 28.2%  | -0.0  | 15.0  |        |
| 2021-2023  | -161.0% | 28.2%  | -0.0  | 39.0  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 453.0%  | 23.2%  | -0.0  | 173.0 |        |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $76.07
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $73.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $68.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $52.24

The price is currently trading above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential uptrend.  However, the significant difference between the short-term (5-day) and long-term (60-day) moving averages indicates volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 72.35 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** -0.57 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.1 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 31.6% (above S&P 500)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to a correction. The negative PPO confirms bearish momentum.  The 31.6% expected return is a significant positive, however, this must be considered alongside the high risk profile indicated by the other data.  The current price ($76.07) being above the moving averages could be interpreted as a recent price increase, without showing whether this is a sustainable trend. More data is needed to determine if it's a rapid surge or a slow, steady climb.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The reported earnings show a consistent increase in revenue and EPS from 2023 to 2024 but the rate of increase is slowing. While EPS has improved and revenue is growing, there's a need to review the actual results against market expectations to determine if the numbers represent outperformance or underperformance.

This section requires information on recent news releases, market outlook, and analyst opinions to provide a comprehensive analysis.  The provided data lacks this context.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR shows significant growth and outperformance relative to the S&P 500, based on cumulative returns. However, this is characterized by high volatility and considerable risk, as evidenced by negative CAGRs in some periods and a high maximum drawdown.  While recent revenue and earnings show growth, further analysis is needed to compare this against market expectations. The high RSI and negative PPO suggest caution. The expected long-term return is positive, but the overall risk profile needs careful consideration before investment.  Missing information on recent news and analyst opinions limits a complete assessment.
