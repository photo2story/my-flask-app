## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Preliminary Analysis:**

PLTR's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  While the exact details require deeper investigation, the substantial difference suggests strong potential, but also higher risk given the volatility implied by the high relative divergence.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a publicly traded data analytics company specializing in big data analysis for government and commercial clients.

| Metric          | PLTR Cumulative Return | VOO Cumulative Return | Difference |
|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| Cumulative Return | 661.75%                | 75.25%                | 586.5%      |


The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals significant volatility and varied performance across different periods.  While recent periods show extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), the earlier periods show substantial negative returns.  The consistently near-zero alpha suggests the returns aren't significantly exceeding what's expected given the market risk (beta).  The drastically increasing Beta values highlight the increasing market sensitivity over time.  This underscores the high risk associated with PLTR's performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $112.62
* **Previous Close:** $116.65
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $110.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $86.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.99

The recent price shows a short-term downward trend (-3.45%), but the price is still above its 5, 20 and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential short-term support.  Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying reasons for the recent price drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 81.02 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 3.75 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -4.0% (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -4.3% (This suggests that while the stock has historically outperformed the S&P 500, the current situation suggests a potential for underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the long term. This needs to be considered in the context of the high risk involved)

The significant negative change in price (-3.45%) from the previous close warrants further investigation into potential news or events impacting the stock price.  The high RSI and negative relative divergence suggest caution, despite the positive PPO. The negative expected return,  while based on a limited data set, indicates caution is warranted regarding long-term outperformance against the S&P 500.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins. However, the stock exhibits high volatility and significant risk, as evidenced by the high beta, large swings in CAGR, and the overbought RSI.  While the cumulative return vastly outperforms the S&P 500, the recent price action, negative expected return, and the extreme variation in performance across periods warrant caution.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk involved before investing.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price drop and the duplicate earnings data entry is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The extremely high relative divergence also implies that this outperformance may not be sustainable and a mean reversion could happen.
