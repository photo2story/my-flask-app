## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a data analytics company specializing in providing software platforms for governmental and commercial clients.

The cumulative return for PLTR is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last day in the provided data is 364.5%.  While this shows substantial outperformance, the relative divergence metric (92.7%) indicates this performance is at the high end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests potential for a reversion to the mean, although the actual risk and probability of such reversion cannot be determined from this data alone.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided CAGR figures show wildly fluctuating performance from year to year.  The negative alphas and relatively high betas, however, suggest that PLTR's performance is not consistently exceeding the market and is subject to significant market volatility. The large beta indicates high correlation with the overall market.  The large swings in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) suggest high risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $78.98
* **Last Market Price:** $78.81 (a slight decrease of $0.17 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $73.99
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $74.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $66.42

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it is significantly above its 60-day moving average, indicating a recent strong price increase.  The recent slight price decrease may be a minor correction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.92 (slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.31 (positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +14.5 (positive, short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -5.4% (This is the projected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  A negative value indicates an expected underperformance compared to the S&P 500.)  This number should be considered with caution, especially given the high volatility demonstrated in prior analysis.

The recent price change (-$0.17) is not significant enough to suggest a major market event (like a sharp upturn or downturn).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |

Equity is increasing, and ROE, while fluctuating, generally shows growth.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR shows significant price appreciation compared to the S&P 500. However, this performance comes with high volatility and risk, as evidenced by large swings in CAGR and MDD.  While recent earnings and financial data show positive trends (increasing revenue and high profit margins), the high relative divergence and negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns about future performance and the sustainability of its recent growth.  The relatively high beta further suggests that the market's overall trend will likely influence PLTR's price significantly.  Investors should proceed with caution and carefully consider the high risk associated with this stock.  Further due diligence including a comprehensive risk assessment is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
