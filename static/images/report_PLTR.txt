## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

PLTR's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  While PLTR shows substantial volatility, its recent performance is positive, although it's currently trading below its moving averages, suggesting potential downside risk.  High profit margins are noted, but ROE is relatively low.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a software company specializing in big data analytics for government and commercial clients.

* **PLTR Cumulative Return:** 171.16%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 45.51%
* **Return Difference:** 125.7% (Relative Difference: 75.7%)

PLTR's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500. However, the relative divergence metric suggests its performance is towards the higher end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500, implying considerable volatility.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |

The data shows extreme volatility and high beta, indicating significant sensitivity to market movements.  The negative alpha in some periods suggests underperformance relative to the market.  However, the recent periods show positive CAGR and a significant increase in market capitalization.  The consistently high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights the risk associated with this investment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR shows a history of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but with extreme volatility.  Recent price action is bearish, indicated by the price dropping below key moving averages.  High profit margins are a positive, but relatively low ROE suggests potential for improved capital efficiency.  The high risk indicated by the MRI, combined with the recent price decline, suggests caution.  Long-term investors might consider the potential for significant outperformance relative to the market, but should be prepared for substantial price swings and potential losses.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data point is necessary.  The high MDD values strongly emphasize the considerable risk associated with investing in PLTR.
