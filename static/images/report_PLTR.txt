## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a software company specializing in big data analytics for government and commercial clients.  The cumulative return of PLTR is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative return between PLTR and VOO as of the last day in the provided data is **377.9%**. This places it at the 95.6th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  While this indicates strong outperformance, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The provided CAGR figures show significant volatility and even negative returns in some periods.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha values are consistently near zero, suggesting that PLTR's returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta). However, the high volatility and wide swings in Beta highlight the stock's significant risk.  The dramatic increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the analyzed periods reflects substantial growth, but also increases risk.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|--------|-------|--------|

This section requires information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown significant price appreciation relative to the S&P 500, but this has been accompanied by high volatility.  Revenue and EPS are growing, and profit margins remain high. However, the projected long-term underperformance against the S&P 500 (-5.6%), along with bearish momentum indicators and significant historical volatility (as seen in the CAGR and Beta values), suggest a high-risk investment.  Further research into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The substantial positive deviation from the S&P 500 is notable, but must be weighed against the significant risk profile.
