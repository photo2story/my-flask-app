## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

PLTR's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a substantially higher growth trajectory.  However,  volatility is evident in the provided data, as reflected in the CAGR and MDD figures.  Recent price movements show a slight downward trend, below key moving averages.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a publicly traded company that provides data analytics software and services to government and commercial clients.

* **PLTR Cumulative Return:** 284.64%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 49.90%
* **Return Difference:** 234.7%
* **Relative Divergence:** 67.0% (This means PLTR's performance relative to VOO is in the 67th percentile of its historical range of divergence.)

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly variable performance, with negative CAGRs in some periods and extremely high positive returns in others, indicating significant volatility.  The consistently low or zero alpha suggests that PLTR's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta), although the very high beta in some periods might signal that PLTR is sensitive to overall market risk. Capitalization (Cap) grew substantially during the period.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -51.0%   | 53.9%    | -51.0%  | 14.9  |       |
| 2021-2023  | -142.0%  | 53.9%    | -160.0% | 39.8  |       |
| 2022-2024  | 283.0%   | 66.4%    | 261.0%  | 175.4 |       |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $84.40
* **Last Market Price:** $83.51 (Down $1.05 from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $89.82
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $86.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $87.82

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The recent price drop of $1.05 signals a potential downward correction or consolidation period.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 56.9 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.25 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -11.7% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** -9.5% (This is short-term; long-term is discussed below)


The negative expected return is consistent with the recent price drop and the fact that the price is below its moving averages.  The MRI suggests a medium level of market risk.

**Long-term Expected Return (2+ years):**  Given PLTR's historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, a long-term investment could potentially yield significant excess returns over VOO, *provided* the company continues its growth trajectory and maintains its technological edge.  However, this prediction involves significant uncertainty given the observed volatility.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has demonstrated remarkable cumulative returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500. However, this performance is characterized by high volatility, reflected in both positive and negative CAGRs and a high beta.  Recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, although the company shows consistent revenue growth and high profit margins.  The relatively low and fluctuating ROE warrants further investigation. Long-term investment potential remains significant, but it carries substantial risk due to the volatility inherent in the stock.  Further due diligence, including a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and future growth prospects, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The conflicting signals of strong historical performance and recent price declines require careful consideration of risk tolerance.
