## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

PLTR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While specific timeframes aren't provided, the cumulative return is dramatically higher than the benchmark.  Key indicators like RSI and PPO suggest a potentially overbought condition, and recent earnings show consistent revenue growth.  However, significant volatility is also apparent.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a data analytics company specializing in big data analysis for government and commercial clients.

* **PLTR Cumulative Return:** 697.53%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 42.87%
* **Return Difference:** 654.7%
* **Relative Divergence:** 100.0% (This indicates PLTR's performance is at the extreme upper end of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.)

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility in PLTR's performance relative to the market. While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of significant growth, the maximum drawdown (MDD) also reveals substantial risk. The Alpha consistently being near 0 suggests the returns are primarily driven by market movements (Beta), although the exceptionally high Beta values in recent periods indicate significantly higher volatility than the market.  The rapid increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the substantial growth in the company's valuation during this timeframe.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -53.0%    | 28.2%    | -0.0  | 14.6  | 14.6   |
| 2021-2023  | -161.0%   | 28.2%    | 0.0   | 39.1  | 39.1   |
| 2022-2024  | 450.0%   | 23.2%    | 0.0   | 172.3 | 172.3  |
| 2023-2025  | 738.0%   | 23.2%    | 0.0   | 268.6 | 268.6  |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $117.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $115.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.18
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $77.91

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an uptrend, although the relatively small gap between the 5-day and the closing price hints at recent consolidation.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 82.01  (Significantly above 70, indicating overbought conditions.  This suggests a potential correction may be imminent.)
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 2.91 (Positive and above zero, confirming the uptrend, but the high RSI level warrants caution.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downward trend in relative strength.)
* **Expected Return (%):** -0.1% (This indicates a very slight negative expected return, likely reflecting the overbought market condition.)  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy, however, could still yield returns above the S&P 500 due to PLTR's high growth potential, but also carries substantial risk.

The price change from the previous close ($0.44) suggests a mild upward momentum, but not a significant jump.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR shows remarkable growth compared to the S&P 500, but this growth is accompanied by high volatility and risk.  The high RSI and the negative short-term relative divergence suggest the stock may be overbought and due for a correction.  While long-term growth potential exists given the consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, investors should exercise caution due to the high volatility and the potential for significant short-term losses.  Further research into the company's future growth prospects and risk factors is essential before making any investment decisions.  The consistently high beta suggests substantial market sensitivity, thus any market downturn could significantly impact PLTR's share price.
