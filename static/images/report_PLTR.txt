While the past performance has been remarkable,  the future outlook necessitates careful consideration of the risks involved given the high volatility and negative expected return. Further investigation into the duplicate EPS data from Q4 2024 is crucial for a complete analysis.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for further growth against the inherent risks before making any investment decisions.
