## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Report

**0. Overview:** Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company that provides software platforms for data integration, analysis, and action.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PLTR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The cumulative return of PLTR is 513.36%, while VOO's is 72.28%. This results in a current divergence of 441.1%, placing it at the 69.5th percentile of its historical range (max divergence: 665.4%, min: -70.9%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance across different periods.  While showing extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in 2022-2025, significantly exceeding the market (represented by a high Beta), earlier periods (2020-2022 and 2021-2023) show substantial negative returns and near-zero Alpha, indicating underperformance relative to the market.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has shown a steady increase.  This volatility highlights a high-risk, high-reward investment profile.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $101.4455
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $82.515

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 53.91 – This indicates a neutral market sentiment, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -2.68 –  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -30.5% – This shows a recent significant decline in relative performance compared to previous periods, reinforcing the bearish trend.
* **Expected Return:** -8.0% – This suggests that at the current valuation, the expected return is negative. However, the long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is unspecified and would need further analysis.  The significant negative price change should be considered a major factor in any investment decision.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR exhibits a high-growth, high-risk profile.  While its cumulative returns vastly exceed the S&P 500, significant volatility and periods of underperformance are evident. Recent price action shows a substantial decline, supported by bearish technical indicators (negative PPO, declining relative divergence).  Despite growing revenue and consistently high profit margins, the negative expected return and recent price drop raise concerns.  A thorough assessment of the company's long-term growth prospects and risk tolerance is crucial before making any investment decision.  The duplicate data entry in the earnings report needs clarification. Further investigation into the drivers of the recent price drop and a comprehensive analysis of the long-term growth potential are warranted.
