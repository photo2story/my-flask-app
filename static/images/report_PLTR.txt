**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -53.0%  | 28.2%   | -0.0  | 14.6  |       |
| 2021-2023  | -161.0% | 28.2%   | 0.0   | 39.1  |       |
| 2022-2024  | 450.0%  | 23.2%   | 0.0   | 172.3 |       |
| 2023-2025  | 734.0%  | 23.2%   | 0.0   | 267.4 |       |

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant volatility, swinging from substantial losses to massive gains.  The high beta values indicate a high sensitivity to market movements, especially in recent years. The alpha values being close to zero suggests that the outperformance might not be consistently attributable to skill but potentially due to market fluctuations.  More data is required for definitive conclusions.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent closing price of $117.39 is significantly above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a strong upward trend. The large difference between the current price and the moving averages, particularly the 60-day average, indicates a recent price surge.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (81.85):**  Indicates the stock is currently in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction might be imminent.
* **PPO (3.40):** A positive PPO value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+2.8):**  Shows a short-term upward trend in relative divergence.
* **Recent Price Change (+4.24%):**  Significant positive change indicative of a sharp upward movement.  This could be a potential factor for overbought conditions reflected in the RSI.
* **Expected Return (-0.2%):**  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is counterintuitive to the current short-term price action and needs further investigation. This could reflect market sentiment shifting in the longer-term or that current high valuations are not sustainable in the long run.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-11-05 | 0.06 | $0.73B      |

There appears to be an error in the data with two entries for 2024-11-05.  Assuming the duplicate is an error, revenue is steadily increasing, though EPS growth is less consistent.  Further analysis would be required to interpret the data accurately and assess the financial health of the company.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this outperformance is significantly higher than its historical pattern.  The current price is significantly above its moving averages, RSI suggests the stock is overbought, and the long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative.  While the financial statements indicate consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, the extremely high relative divergence and negative expected return raise concerns about sustainability.  Careful consideration is needed before making investment decisions.  A more in-depth analysis, including a thorough examination of the company's fundamentals and future prospects, is recommended before any investment decisions are made.  The conflicting signals warrant caution and further investigation.
