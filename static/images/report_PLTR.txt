## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Preliminary Analysis:**

PLTR's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While the S&P 500 shows a cumulative return of 51.26%, PLTR boasts a return of 310.56%. This substantial difference, however, needs to be considered in light of the higher risk associated with PLTR, as evidenced by its volatility and beta.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company that provides software and services to government and commercial clients.

PLTR's cumulative return (310.56%) drastically surpasses VOO's (51.26%), resulting in a significant divergence.  The relative divergence metric of 72.4% indicates that PLTR's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. However, this high relative divergence needs further context from considering its high volatility.


The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals highly volatile performance:

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -51.0% | 53.9%  | -0.0  | 14.0  |  |
| 2021-2023  | -142.0% | 53.9%  | -0.0  | 37.4  |  |
| 2022-2024  | 283.0% | 66.4%  | -0.0  | 164.7 |  |
| 2023-2025  | 349.0% | 66.4%  | 0.1   | 196.1 |  |

Noteworthy is the significantly high beta values, indicating substantially higher volatility than the market (S&P 500).  The negative CAGRs in earlier periods highlight periods of significant underperformance.  The high positive CAGRs in later periods need to be considered in the context of the highly variable nature of the investment. The alpha is generally low, suggesting that the outperformance isn't consistently due to factors beyond market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $90.09
* **Last Market Price:** $83.74 (a decrease of $2.11 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $93.32
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $86.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $87.53

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price drop of $2.11 from the previous close indicates a potential short-term decline that requires further investigation.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.12 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.30 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -8.3% (This is a short-term estimate and doesn't reflect long-term potential.)

The relatively small price drop in the last market update, coupled with a positive PPO and a RSI above 50, does not indicate an immediate 8.3% drop. While the MRI suggests medium risk, this needs further context within the larger market environment.  A more comprehensive assessment is needed to interpret these indicators fully. The negative expected return is likely short term and the long term potential must be evaluated separately.  The potential long-term outperformance over S&P 500 needs further analysis based on its high beta and volatility.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR exhibits a high growth trajectory, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative returns.  However, this performance comes with substantial risk, as indicated by its high beta and volatile historical performance.  Recent price movements suggest a short-term bearish trend.  While financial statements show healthy revenue growth and high profit margins, further investigation is needed to fully understand the sustainability of its performance and the accuracy of the provided data (particularly the duplicate earnings entry).  The high volatility necessitates a careful risk assessment before investment, and a long-term perspective is crucial to mitigate the impact of short-term fluctuations. A deeper dive into the company's fundamentals, future growth prospects, and competitive landscape is crucial before forming a conclusive opinion.  The provided data is insufficient to confidently determine the long-term outperformance over the S&P 500.
