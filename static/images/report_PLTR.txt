**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

PLTR's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  While the S&P 500 shows a modest return, PLTR exhibits substantially higher growth. However, this high growth comes with higher volatility, as evidenced by the wide range of historical relative divergence.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a software company specializing in big data analytics for government and commercial clients.

* **PLTR Cumulative Return:** 96.42%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 8.24%

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B)  |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| 2020-2022  | -56.0%   | 70.8%    | -0.0    | 15.5    |         |
| 2021-2023  | -193.0%  | 70.8%    | -0.0    | 41.5    |         |
| 2022-2024  | 123.0%   | 70.6%    | -0.0    | 182.8   |         |
| 2023-2025  | 141.0%   | 74.8%    | -0.0    | 188.1   |         |


Analysis:  The CAGR shows significant volatility, swinging from large negative returns to substantial positive returns year-over-year.  The consistently near-zero alpha suggests PLTR's returns are largely driven by market movements (high beta), with limited outperformance relative to the broader market.  The high beta indicates significant sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Note that the missing market capitalization data ('Cap(B)') limits a complete analysis.



**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $77.84
* **Last Market Price:** $80.2 (3.03% increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $81.52
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $85.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $88.46

Analysis: The recent price shows a slight uptrend, but it is still below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential for further price increase, although the current price is relatively closer to the 5-day average than the others. The 3.03% increase from the previous close might indicate a minor positive shift in sentiment.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.36 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** -1.33 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.3% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -19.9% (This is a significant negative expected return, which warrants further investigation into the underlying assumptions.)

Analysis: The technical indicators paint a mixed picture.  While the RSI suggests potential for a bounce, the negative PPO and negative relative divergence change point to short-term bearish momentum.  The high MRI indicates substantial risk. The significantly negative expected return (-19.9%) compared to S&P 500 over the long term is a major concern and needs deeper investigation into the methodology used for calculating this expectation.  The recent price increase suggests some short-term positive market reaction.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR exhibits strong growth in terms of cumulative return, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this is accompanied by substantial volatility, as highlighted by its high beta and the fluctuating CAGR.  The negative expected return (-19.9%) is a major red flag and requires careful examination of the methodology used to derive this figure. Technical indicators present a mixed outlook; while showing potential for a short-term price bounce, long-term projections remain uncertain.  Fundamentals show revenue growth and high profit margins, but ROE needs further analysis. Before making any investment decision, it is crucial to perform in-depth due diligence, focusing on understanding the assumptions behind the -19.9% expected return, and further investigate the company's long-term growth prospects in relation to its high volatility.  The duplicate data entry in the earnings report also needs clarification.
