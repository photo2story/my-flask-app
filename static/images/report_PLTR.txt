**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company specializing in providing software platforms for government and commercial clients.  PLTR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a 51.8% higher cumulative return.  The high relative divergence suggests that this outperformance is relatively unusual compared to its historical performance relative to the VOO.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows highly volatile alpha and beta values, suggesting high risk and significant market sensitivity.  The high beta values (especially in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024) indicate that PLTR's price is highly correlated with the overall market, but with large swings exceeding market movements.  Negative alpha values in most periods signal underperformance relative to the market benchmark after accounting for beta.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown strong past performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, recent price action, coupled with bearish technical indicators (RSI, PPO, and negative expected return) and high market risk, points to significant near-term downside potential.  The high beta suggests substantial market sensitivity. While the financial information shows steady revenue growth and high profit margins, the volatility and negative alpha raise serious concerns about long-term investment strategy.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy *might* still be considered despite the current negative expected return, only if the investor has a high risk tolerance and believes in PLTR's long-term growth prospects.  Further investigation into the -40.6% expected return calculation and clarification of duplicated earnings data is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Thorough due diligence is crucial.
