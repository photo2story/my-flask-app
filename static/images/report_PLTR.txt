**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company specializing in big data analysis for government and commercial clients.  Over the period analyzed, PLTR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a much higher cumulative return.  The provided relative divergence metric highlights this outperformance relative to its historical volatility. However,  this should be viewed cautiously, as past performance is not indicative of future results.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR figures show substantial volatility in PLTR's performance across different periods. The negative CAGR values in the earlier periods (2020-2022 and 2021-2023) are concerning. The dramatic improvement in CAGR during 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 indicates potential positive momentum. Note that the Alpha is consistently near zero, suggesting that PLTR's returns haven't significantly outperformed its benchmark after accounting for its beta. A low beta suggests less volatility than the broader market, though not necessarily a safer bet. Market capitalization shows consistent increase, reflecting growth.


| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|

| 2021-2023  | -193.0%| 70.8%  | -210.0%| -0.0   | 41.6   |
| 2022-2024  | 123.0% | 70.6%  | 104.0% | -0.0   | 183.2  |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $93.99
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $93.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $91.68

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting upward momentum in the short-term.  The recent price change of $3.51 indicates a significant jump compared to the previous closing price. This sharp upward movement is crucial when considering the overall picture.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.57 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 1.1893 (Positive; suggests upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -19.6% (This suggests a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.)

The recent price increase of $3.51 signifies a sharp upward movement,  potentially indicating a rapid price surge that needs more careful analysis. The negative expected return, however, presents a serious caution against long-term investment, although further investigation into the assumptions behind this figure is needed.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown impressive returns exceeding the S&P 500, particularly in recent periods. However, past performance is not a guarantee of future success.  The high volatility highlighted by the CAGR and MDD figures requires caution.  The consistently high profit margins are positive. While recent price movements show upward momentum, the long-term expected return (relative to the S&P 500) is negative according to the provided data.  Further detailed analysis of the financial statements, and investigation into the sources and assumptions of the -19.6% expected return, are highly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The sharp recent price increase warrants further investigation into the factors driving this movement.  Investors should be aware of the inherent risk associated with this company.
