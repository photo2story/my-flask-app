**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant volatility in PLTR's performance and a high beta, indicating a high sensitivity to market movements. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of strong growth (450%, 506%), it's offset by periods of substantial losses (-53%, -161%).

The significant change in Beta indicates increasing market sensitivity over time.


| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -53.0%  | 28.2%  | -0.0  | 15.1  |       |
| 2021-2023  | -161.0% | 28.2%  | -0.0  | 40.3  |       |
| 2022-2024  | 450.0%  | 23.2%  | -0.0  | 177.4 |       |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $84.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $84.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $99.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $85.04

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price increase (from $80.46 to $84.91) indicates a recent positive change but is still within a bearish context considering the moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 25.79 (indicates oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -3.21 (suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -8.1% (relative to S&P 500)  This indicates that even though PLTR has historically outperformed the market, the model predicts a lower return than the S&P 500 over the long term.  This should be treated with caution and further research should be done to validate this model prediction.

The significant price change of $5.53 is noteworthy, indicating a potential short-term upward trend.  However, the long-term projection (-8.1%) suggests potential undervaluation despite the rapid gains in price recently.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Further in-depth analysis is needed to validate the projected negative expected return, particularly investigating the sources of volatility and the reasons for the fluctuations in ROE.  The information provided suggests a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity with a need for careful consideration of the company's fundamental performance and the market environment.
