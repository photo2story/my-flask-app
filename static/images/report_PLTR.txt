## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

This report analyzes Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) stock performance, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company specializing in big data analytics for governmental and commercial clients.

The cumulative return of PLTR is 386.03%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 78.1%.  The difference is 307.93%, placing it at the 96.26th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantially higher return than the benchmark index.  However,  the high relative percentile should be considered in the context of the high volatility shown in the Alpha/Beta analysis.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -32.4%   | 72.8%    | -56.0% | 1.7   | 14.0   |
| 2021-2023  | -26.5%   | 72.8%    | -61.5% | 2.0   | 37.4   |
| 2022-2024  | 247.3%  | 57.7%    | 217.2% | 2.2   | 133.8  |

The data shows high volatility and a high beta, indicating significant sensitivity to market movements.  While recent returns have been exceptionally high (247.3% CAGR from 2022-2024), the earlier periods show significant negative returns and high maximum drawdown (MDD).  The high Alpha suggests significant outperformance relative to the market, but this must be considered alongside the risks inherent in the high Beta and MDD.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $64.35 (Last-market: $64.33)
* 5-Day Moving Average: $62.41
* 20-Day Moving Average: $54.86
* 60-Day Moving Average: $43.74

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The significant gap between the short-term (5-day) and longer-term (60-day) averages points to a recent rapid price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* RSI: 79.4 (Overbought)
* PPO: 0.09 (Positive, but relatively low)
* 20-Day Relative Strength Change: +23.5% (Strong short-term upward momentum)
* Expected Return (2+ years): 0.03% (marginal excess return over S&P 500)


The high RSI (79.4) suggests the stock is overbought and potentially vulnerable to a correction. The positive PPO indicates upward momentum, but the relatively low value suggests this momentum might be weakening.  The expected return is extremely low considering the high volatility and past performance. The recent sharp price increase (+23.5% in 20 days) warrants caution. A sudden correction is possible.

**8. Summary:**

PLTR has shown exceptional returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500, but this has been accompanied by high volatility and risk.  Recent performance indicators suggest an overbought condition and potential for a correction. While revenue and profit margins are strong, the modest ROE requires further analysis.  The information provided lacks detail on the latest earnings report and current market sentiment, which are crucial for a complete evaluation.  News from reliable financial sources is necessary to build a more comprehensive overview.  The high beta and historic MDD suggest this is a higher risk investment, despite the recent strong performance.  The very low projected long-term excess return compared to S&P 500 requires careful consideration.
