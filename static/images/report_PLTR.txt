*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests using 90% of cash to buy shares, considered a "safe" move, which seems somewhat contradictory given the recent price decline but aligns with the high MRI.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent short-term price decrease.
