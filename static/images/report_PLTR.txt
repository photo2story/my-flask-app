## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a data analytics company specializing in big data analytics for government and commercial clients.

The cumulative return of PLTR is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 367.1%, placing it at the 93.3rd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  While this demonstrates strong outperformance, the high relative divergence should be considered in context with the high volatility indicated in the Alpha/Beta analysis.  The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly variable performance across different periods, indicating substantial risk.  High positive CAGR in some periods is offset by extremely negative returns in others.  The high Beta values suggest significant sensitivity to market movements.

* **Closing Price:** $77.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $80.29
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $74.92
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $58.98

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting recent downward pressure. However, it is above both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term trend reversal.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -6.7% – Shows a recent short-term downward trend.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR exhibits high growth potential, as evidenced by its significantly higher cumulative return compared to the S&P 500. However, this performance comes with considerable volatility and risk, as highlighted by the negative Alpha, highly variable Beta, and the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500.  Recent price action shows some short-term weakness, with bearish momentum indicated by technical indicators.  Consistent revenue growth is positive but slowing growth rates and a slight decrease in profit margin need further investigation.  The information provided is insufficient for a complete evaluation of earnings beats or misses.  More information about recent news and analyst sentiment is needed to complete the overall assessment.  The high risk profile of this investment requires careful consideration of the investor's risk tolerance.
