2025-12-25 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Palantir Technologies (PLTR) based on the provided data, broken down into sections as requested:

**0. Executive Summary**

Palantir (PLTR) is experiencing significant growth, reflected in its strong recent returns and positive earnings reports. However, analyst consensus remains at "Hold" with a target price below the current market price, suggesting potential for volatility and uncertainty. The technical indicators point towards a potentially overbought condition in the short term, but long-term expectations remain positive. The company's high growth rate and profitability potential are balanced against its high valuation and market sentiment.

**1. Return Rate Comparison (PLTR vs. VOO)**

*   **PLTR:** Palantir Technologies Inc. delivers data analytics solutions and services to various industries.
*   **Cumulative Return (PLTR):** 224.16%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 54.25%
*   **Divergence:** Current: 169.9, Relative Divergence: 80.9

**Analysis:**
Palantir has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return. The divergence indicates a substantial outperformance. The relative divergence of 80.9 suggests that the outperformance, relative to its historical range compared to the S&P 500, is currently strong but not at its absolute peak.
The following Alpha, Beta analysis shows that the potential can vary widely depending on the time period selected.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -54.0% | 81.0% | -38.0% | -0.0 | 15.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -131.0% | 81.0% | -132.0% | 0.0 | 41.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 155.0% | 81.0% | 134.0% | 0.0 | 181.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 267.0% | 81.0% | 202.0% | 0.1 | 462.8 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR is highly variable depending on the starting year. The most recent period (2023-2025) shows an extremely high growth rate, but earlier periods show significant losses.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD is consistently high at 81%, indicating significant price volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is also highly variable, mirroring the trends in CAGR. Recent years show very high alpha, suggesting outperformance compared to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500), while earlier periods show negative alpha.
*   **Beta:**  Beta is consistently low (close to 0), suggesting that Palantir's price movement is not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). This means that PLTR's returns are largely independent of the market's direction.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** Market capitalization has grown significantly, especially in the most recent period, reflecting increased investor confidence and higher valuation.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 193.38
*   **Last Market Price:** 194.17, Previous Close: 194.13, Change: 0.02
*   **5-day SMA:** 185.47
*   **20-day SMA:** 177.27
*   **60-day SMA:** 180.28

**Analysis:**
The current price is above all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), which is generally considered a bullish signal. However, the relatively small price change on the last market day, especially with a price near 194, means that it is already high priced (and can be considered volatile).

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 70.94
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.8177
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-04)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 6.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4.5

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a moderate level of risk, recommending a medium investment approach.
*   The RSI is above 70, indicating that the stock is potentially overbought. This could suggest a possible pullback or consolidation in the near future.
*   The PPO is positive, indicating that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, which is a bullish signal.
*   The hybrid signal also indicates a bullish bias, but the 0% cash ratio may indicate an aggressive portfolio setup.
*   A +6.1 increase in the 20-day relative divergence implies a recent upward trend compared to VOO.
*   The expected return of 4.5% is the expected excess return compared to S&P 500, if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Headlines:**  "Palantir Zooms Into Buy Zone After Contract Wins, Earnings Beat," "How Palantir Stock Can Jump From Here," "Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) Stock Price Prediction for 2026: Where Will It Be in 1 Year," "Stock-Split Watch: Is Palantir Next?"
*   **Neutral/Cautionary Headlines:** "Palantir (PLTR) Stock After Hours on Dec. 24, 2025: What Happened After the Bell," "Strong Tower Advisory Services Cuts Stock Holdings in Palantir Technologies Inc."

**Analysis:**
Recent news sentiment is mixed. While positive headlines highlight contract wins, earnings, and potential for future growth, a headline about reduced holdings from Strong Tower Advisory Services indicates a note of caution. The "Stock-Split Watch" headline suggests investor interest and positive expectations for the company's future performance.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 3.00)
*   **Opinions:** 21
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 186.81 / 255.00 / 50.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:**  None provided (empty values:  →  ())

**Analysis:**
The analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting a neutral outlook on the stock. The average target price of 186.81 is *below* the current price (193.38), indicating that analysts, on average, believe the stock is currently overvalued. The wide range between the high and low target prices reflects significant disagreement among analysts about the stock's potential. The absence of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the current analyst sentiment beyond the overall "Hold" consensus.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

Palantir exhibits strong growth characteristics, including increasing revenue, high profit margins, and a rising ROE. Its stock price has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. However, several factors warrant caution:

*   **High Valuation:** The analyst consensus target price is below the current market price, suggesting the stock may be overvalued. The high RSI supports this.
*   **Analyst Indecision:** The "Hold" consensus and wide range in target prices indicate uncertainty among analysts about the company's future prospects.
*   **Volatility:** The consistently high MDD indicates significant price volatility, which could lead to large losses.
*   **News Sentiment:** While recent news is largely positive, there are some cautionary headlines suggesting potential downside risks.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The overbought RSI may signal a potential pullback in the short term.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a conservative approach is warranted. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in Palantir. While the company's growth potential is attractive, its high valuation and volatility present significant risks. A "Hold" rating is appropriate, emphasizing the need for close monitoring and further analysis before making a significant investment decision.
