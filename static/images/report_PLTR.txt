## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a data analytics company specializing in big data analytics for government and commercial clients.

The cumulative return for PLTR is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 397.0%, representing the 99.6th percentile of historical divergence based on the provided data.  This indicates PLTR has substantially outperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period.  However, the high volatility is evident in the wide range of historical divergences (max: 398.7, min: -70.9). The CAGR figures show significant volatility and even negative returns in some periods, highlighting the high risk associated with this investment.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $82.14
* **5-day Moving Average:** $79.99
* **20-day Moving Average:** $73.76
* **60-day Moving Average:** $57.66

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The significant difference between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a recent acceleration in price growth.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 66.69 (Approaching overbought territory)

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -5.1% (relative to the S&P 500)

The RSI suggests the stock is approaching overbought conditions, implying a potential short-term correction. The negative PPO, however, indicates weakening momentum. The positive change in relative strength, alongside the price being significantly above the moving averages, suggests a potential short-term bullish trend, but this needs careful consideration given the RSI and PPO readings. The negative expected return indicates that, based on the provided data, long-term investment may underperform the S&P 500.

The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits the scope of the analysis.  Further investigation into the company's future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and any recent news affecting the stock price is crucial before making an investment decision. The high volatility and negative expected return relative to the broader market indicate a high-risk investment.
