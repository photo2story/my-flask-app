## Palantir Technologies Inc (PLTR) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a data analytics company specializing in providing software platforms for government and commercial clients.

The cumulative return for PLTR is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 284.9 percentage points.  While the relative divergence metric (75.8%) indicates PLTR's performance is in the upper range of historical deviations from VOO, it's crucial to understand this doesn't guarantee future outperformance.  The high relative divergence suggests considerable volatility and risk.


| Metric             | PLTR                  | VOO                    | Difference |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Cumulative Return   | 352.63%                | 67.74%                 | 284.9%      |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $65.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $67.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $74.85
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $63.40

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The price is notably below the 20-day and 5-day moving averages, indicating bearish momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 25.24 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce, but also vulnerability to further decline)
* **PPO:** -3.06 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -13.6% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -8.9% (This indicates a projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This should be viewed cautiously given the high volatility of PLTR.)

The current price of $65.91, being below its moving averages, doesn't strongly suggest a significant imminent price jump (e.g., rapid rebound). However, given the oversold RSI, a short-term bounce is possible but not guaranteed.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 historically, but this comes with high volatility.  Current technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, with the price trading below key moving averages and RSI in oversold territory. While revenue growth is positive, profit margins have slightly decreased and ROE remains low.  The projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-8.9%) needs careful consideration, especially given the significant historical volatility. Any investment decision should consider the inherent risk involved and diversification strategies.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data point is necessary.  Consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
