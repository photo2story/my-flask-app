**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** While early periods show significant negative CAGR, recent years demonstrate substantial growth (155% and 254%). This highlights a potential turnaround or acceleration in Palantir's performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** A consistent MDD of 81% across all periods indicates high volatility and risk.

*   A 5% expected return offers some additional upside.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Headlines:** Several headlines (Dec 18) highlight positive price movement and new deals (Navy ShipOS).
