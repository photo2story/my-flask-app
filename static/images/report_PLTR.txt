*   **Risk:** The MDD suggests high volatility. Recent price action shows a slight short-term downward trend.
*   **Future Outlook:** The Accenture partnership and analyst forecasts suggest continued growth. However, the "Hold" consensus, and the sensitivity to broader market trends, warrant caution.
