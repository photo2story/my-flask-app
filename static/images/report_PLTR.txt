## Palantir Technologies Inc (PLTR) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

PLTR's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  While VOO shows a 13.13% cumulative return, PLTR boasts a 100.23% return. This substantial difference highlights the stock's higher risk and potential reward profile.  Further analysis is needed to determine if this outperformance is sustainable.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company specializing in providing software and services for governmental and commercial clients.

The provided data shows PLTR's cumulative return as 100.23%, compared to the S&P 500's 13.13%.  The relative divergence of 87.1%, placed at the 56.9th percentile of historical divergence (ranging from a minimum of -56.4% to a maximum of 196%), suggests PLTR's performance has been significantly above the S&P 500, but not unusually so within its historical context.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance over the years:

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -56.0% | 70.8%  | -0.0  | 15.6  |     |
| 2021-2023  | -193.0%| 70.8%  | -0.0  | 41.6  |     |
| 2022-2024  | 123.0% | 70.6%  | -0.0  | 183.2 |     |
| 2023-2025  | 145.0% | 70.6%  | -0.0  | 219.9 |     |

The high Beta values indicate PLTR is significantly more volatile than the market.  The consistently near-zero Alpha suggests that PLTR's returns are largely explained by market movements, although the recent positive CAGRs suggest possible outperformance.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap) shows the company's growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $90.80
* **Previous Close:** $93.78
* **Change:** -$3.18 (-3.39%)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $93.66
* **20-day Moving Average:** $88.41
* **60-day Moving Average:** $91.43

The recent price shows a decline, currently below both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, but above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term correction after a recent period of higher prices.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.46 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.235 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -20.7% (Short-term negative expectation; however, the long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not provided, therefore cannot be assessed.)


The recent price drop of $3.18 reflects a noticeable short-term decline.  Given the relatively high beta, this is consistent with the stock's volatile nature.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown significantly higher returns than the S&P 500, although its high beta indicates substantial volatility.  Recent price movements suggest a short-term correction.  Financial statements show consistent revenue growth and high profit margins.  However, some data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) require clarification.  The high beta necessitates a thorough risk assessment before investment.  Long-term prospects depend on continued revenue growth and market acceptance of its data analytics services.  More detailed and consistent data is needed for a more comprehensive analysis.  The missing long-term expected return makes it hard to asses the long-term investment potential of PLTR.
