## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a data analytics company specializing in big data analytics for governmental and commercial clients.

The cumulative return of PLTR is 392.87%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 73.37%.  The difference is 319.5%, placing it at the 83.1st percentile of the historical range of divergence (max: 398.7, min: -70.9). This indicates a substantially higher return than the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. However, it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The high divergence should be examined in light of the risk factors (see below).

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided CAGR figures show extreme volatility, ranging from a substantial loss to a massive gain depending on the period considered.  The near-zero alpha across all periods indicates that the returns were not significantly different from what would be expected given the beta (market risk). The high beta values (around 163) across all periods suggests a high sensitivity to market movements.  This extreme volatility makes the investment risky despite high returns in some periods.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -53.0% | 63.2% | -0.0 | 163.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -62.0% | 63.2% | -86.0% | 163.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 423.0% | 52.5% | 401.0% | 163.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 444.0% | 29.3% | 375.0% | 163.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $71.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $68.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $64.75

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The recent price increase of $3.65 (from the previous close) might indicate a temporary upward swing, but further observation is needed to confirm this.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 34.45 - This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.67 - A negative PPO value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +5.2 (short-term upward trend) - This suggests a recent upward movement in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** -7.1% - This indicates a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This low expected return should be weighed against the potential for high volatility, a key characteristic of PLTR.

The recent price increase of $3.65 does suggest a potential short-term upward swing. However, considering the negative expected return and other indicators, it's hard to conclude that this change shows a significant change in the long-term prospects of the company.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a steady increase in revenue and a relatively stable EPS.  However, there seems to be a minor discrepancy in the data for 2024-11-05, showing two different EPS values (0.06 and 0.03).  Clarification on this inconsistency is needed for accurate analysis.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-11-05 | 0.06 | $0.73 B     |
| 2024-08-06 | 0.06 | $0.68 B     |
| 2024-05-07 | 0.05 | $0.63 B     |
| 2023-11-03 | 0.03 | $0.56 B     |
| 2024-11-05 | 0.03 | $0.56 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows a consistent upward trend. Profit margins remain high but show a slightly declining trend, potentially suggesting increasing costs. Equity is also increasing. The ROE (Return on Equity) is relatively low, especially considering the high profit margin.  This could indicate potential issues with the efficiency of capital utilization.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.73B | 79.79% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.68B | 81.04% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.63B | 81.67% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.61B | 82.14% |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.56B | 80.66% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $4.50B | 3.19% |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.05B | 3.31% |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.78B | 2.80% |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.48B | 2.69% |
| 2023-09-30 | $3.19B | 2.24% |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500 in certain periods, but this is accompanied by significant volatility and a high beta, indicating substantial market risk. The recent price movement shows some short-term upward momentum, but negative long-term expected return (-7.1%) is a concern. The company's financials show steady revenue growth and high profit margins, but relatively low ROE raises questions about capital efficiency.  Further investigation into the inconsistency in the earnings data is crucial.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with PLTR before investing.
