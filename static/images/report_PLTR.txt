This indicates a substantial outperformance, though past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -32.4%   | 72.8%  | -56.0% | 1.7   | 14.0   |
| 2021-2023  | -26.5%   | 72.8%  | -61.5% | 2.0   | 37.4   |
| 2022-2024  | 248.9%  | 57.7%  | 218.4% | 2.2   | 140.3  |

The high beta values indicate significant volatility, exceeding market movements.  The substantial positive alpha in 2022-2024 suggests significant outperformance relative to the market during that period, but negative alpha in previous periods reveals periods of underperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $64.65
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $63.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $55.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $44.29

The stock price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively large gap between the short-term and long-term moving averages might indicate a recent surge in price.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 72.84 -  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered >70).  This suggests potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.08 - Slightly negative, indicating bearish momentum, though very close to neutral.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +23.85 -  Shows a recent upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 0.03% -  A modest expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is a long-term projection and should not be interpreted as a guaranteed outcome.  Given the volatility of PLTR, significant variance from this projection is likely.
