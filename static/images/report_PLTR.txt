The relative divergence indicator shows this as 100%, indicating it's at the highest point of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  However,  it's crucial to remember that this high relative divergence is based on the provided historical data and doesn't guarantee future performance. The provided CAGR figures show significant volatility and negative returns over certain periods.  The high beta values indicate that PLTR's price is highly sensitive to market fluctuations.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (NaN):**  Missing data prevents analysis.
* **Expected Return (34.1%):** This represents a significant potential outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This figure needs further clarification regarding its calculation methodology and underlying assumptions.  A 34.1% outperformance is highly ambitious and should be approached with caution.  The current price ($71.87) shows a recent uptrend but whether this qualifies as "급반등 (sudden surge)" needs context beyond the provided 5, 20, and 60-day averages.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires the inclusion of any relevant news articles or announcements released within the past two days regarding earnings, market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This information was not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR demonstrates strong revenue growth and high profit margins. However, significant volatility, as evidenced by the CAGR and beta values, makes it a high-risk investment.  The high relative divergence compared to the S&P 500 is striking, but sustainability is questionable.  Technical indicators suggest near-term caution, although the price is above its moving averages which is bullish.   The expected return is considerable, but needs clarification on methodology and underlying assumptions to gauge its credibility.  The erratic EPS results require further clarification to remove the duplicate entry and to provide context for the growth, which seems unstable. The relatively low ROE warrants further investigation into the company's capital allocation strategy.   More information is needed regarding recent news and analyst opinions to provide a complete and informed analysis.
