## Palantir Technologies Inc (PLTR) Stock Review

This report analyzes Palantir Technologies Inc (PLTR), a data analytics company specializing in big data and artificial intelligence, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

PLTR's cumulative return of 406.65% significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 80.58%.  The difference is 326.07%, representing the highest divergence observed historically (based on the provided "상대이격도" of 100%).  However, this high divergence needs to be viewed in the context of the historical volatility shown in the CAGR and MDD figures below.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -48.0%   | 30.6%    | -0.1  | 14.0  |        |
| 2021-2023  | -194.0%  | 30.6%    | -0.1  | 37.0  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 408.0%   | 23.5%    | -0.1  | 144.0 |        |

The negative alpha values across all periods suggest PLTR underperformed the market compared to its beta, although the last period shows a strong positive CAGR. The significantly high beta values indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The substantial increase in Beta from 2020-2022 to 2022-2024 highlights increased market sensitivity during that period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $67.08
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $65.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $59.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $46.09

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.54 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.34 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** nan (-) (Indicates recent short-term price decline)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 30.8% (This significantly outpaces the expected S&P 500 return, but the extremely high Beta suggests this might be very volatile).

The conflicting signals from the RSI and PPO, along with the negative relative divergence, suggest caution.  The high expected return should be viewed in the context of the significant risk implied by the high beta.  The fact that the price ($67.07) is near the last recorded price indicates no significant immediate jumps or drops (no recent sharp up or downturns).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The reported earnings show consistent revenue growth, although the rate of growth is slowing.  EPS has fluctuated but is relatively consistent in the last two years. No significant surprises or misses (compared to unknown expectations) can be noted.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue      |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-11-05 | $0.06 | $0.73 Billion |
| 2024-08-06 | $0.06 | $0.68 Billion |
| 2024-05-07 | $0.05 | $0.63 Billion |
| 2023-11-03 | $0.03 | $0.56 Billion |
| 2023-11-05 | $0.03 | $0.56 Billion |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals strong revenue growth and high profit margins.  However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is relatively low, suggesting that the company might not be utilizing its equity as efficiently as it could.  Revenue growth is decelerating, which is a factor to consider.


| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin | Equity  | ROE   |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------|-------|
| 2024-09-30  | $0.73B      | 79.79%        | $4.50B  | 3.19% |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.68B      | 81.04%        | $4.05B  | 3.31% |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.63B      | 81.67%        | $3.78B  | 2.80% |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.61B      | 82.14%        | $3.48B  | 2.69% |
| 2023-09-30  | $0.56B      | 80.66%        | $3.19B  | 2.24% |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown exceptional returns exceeding the S&P 500 significantly. However, this performance comes with considerable risk, as evidenced by the high beta and volatile historical CAGR.  Recent performance is positive, with revenue growth and relatively stable EPS. The high profit margins are encouraging. However, low ROE and slowing revenue growth are concerns.  Missing market context and analyst opinions hinder a complete assessment.  More information is needed on the recent market outlook and analyst sentiment to make a more informed decision.  The high expected return must be carefully weighed against the inherent volatility.

**8. Recommendation:**

Due to limited information (missing market outlook, analyst opinions and news context), a definitive buy or sell recommendation cannot be made.  Further research into current market conditions, analyst sentiment, and a deeper dive into the reasons behind the slowing revenue growth and low ROE are crucial before making any investment decision. The high volatility inherent in PLTR should be carefully considered by investors with varying risk tolerances.
