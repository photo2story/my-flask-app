**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a software company specializing in big data analytics for government and commercial clients.  PLTR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return more than seven times greater.  However, the relative divergence metric highlights that this outperformance is within the context of significant historical volatility in PLTR's performance.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile performance, characterized by significant swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  The consistently near-zero alpha suggests PLTR's returns haven't consistently outperformed the market after accounting for its beta (volatility).  The increasing beta indicates increasing market sensitivity over time.  The dramatic shifts in CAGR and MDD highlight the risk associated with investing in PLTR.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -56.0%  | 70.8%   | -0.0  | 15.2  |
| 2021-2023  | -193.0% | 70.8%   | -0.0  | 40.5  |
| 2022-2024  | 123.0%  | 70.6%   | -0.0  | 178.5 |
| 2023-2025  | 215.0%  | 70.6%   | -0.0  | 293.3 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $124.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $117.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $98.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $95.40

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The significant difference between the current price and the longer-term moving averages reflects the recent rapid price increase. The last market data shows a significant one-day increase (6.95$), indicating a potential short-term overbought condition that demands careful monitoring.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 81.04 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for price correction)
* **PPO:** 2.65 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -10.1% (relative to S&P 500)

The high RSI and the recent significant price jump ('change' value of 6.95 is substantial) suggest a potential short-term pullback is possible.  Despite the high relative historical performance, the negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 suggests that future returns might not mirror past performance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Revenue is steadily increasing, indicating growth.  EPS is relatively stable, but not showing substantial growth.

**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profit margins show a steady growth trend,  however ROE fluctuates but generally shows modest profitability. The company appears financially healthy with growing revenue and high profit margins, but profitability relative to equity (ROE) requires further investigation into underlying factors.


| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin | Equity | ROE   |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------|-------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.83B   | 78.91%        | $5.00B  | 1.58% |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.73B   | 79.79%        | $4.50B  | 3.19% |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.68B   | 81.04%        | $4.05B  | 3.31% |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.63B   | 81.67%        | $3.78B  | 2.80% |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.61B   | 82.14%        | $3.48B  | 2.69% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has demonstrated exceptionally high growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 historically.  However, this performance is coupled with high volatility and a negative expected return relative to the market in the longer term. The recent price surge suggests a potential overbought condition, and a pullback is possible.  While the financial statements show a strong revenue and profit margin growth trend, the relatively low and fluctuating ROE warrants further investigation.  Investing in PLTR requires a high risk tolerance due to its volatile nature and the inherent uncertainty associated with its long-term growth trajectory.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before making any investment decision.
