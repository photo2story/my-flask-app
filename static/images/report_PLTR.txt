**1. Performance Overview & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a data analytics company specializing in big data analysis for government and commercial clients.

The cumulative return for PLTR is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns is 398.7 percentage points (474.34% - 75.69%).  The provided relative divergence of 100.0 indicates PLTR's performance is at the highest point relative to its past performance compared to the S&P 500 within the observed period. However, this doesn't imply consistent outperformance; the historical data reveals periods of significant underperformance as evidenced by the negative CAGR values in the provided table.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided alpha values are consistently near zero, suggesting PLTR's returns are largely correlated with the market (as reflected in the beta values).  However, the high volatility and wildly fluctuating CAGR's across the periods indicate a high-risk investment.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth over time.
