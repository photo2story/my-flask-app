## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is a data analytics company that provides software and services to government and commercial clients.  The provided data shows PLTR's cumulative return significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The cumulative return difference on the last day of the data is 287.4%, with a relative divergence of 90.94% based on the historical range. This indicates PLTR's performance has been considerably higher than the S&P 500 during the periods analyzed.  However, it's crucial to consider the periods analyzed, as the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies significantly, sometimes even showing negative returns.  A high relative divergence doesn't guarantee future outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows fluctuating Alpha and Beta values across different periods. High Alpha values suggest significant outperformance compared to the benchmark (S&P500).  However, high Beta values (especially in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements. The market capitalization (Cap) has increased substantially over the periods, which could significantly affect the CAGR and MDD(Maximum Drawdown).
