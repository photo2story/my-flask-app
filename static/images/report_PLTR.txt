## Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

PLTR's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While the specific timeframe isn't explicitly stated, the substantial difference in cumulative returns (170.01% vs. 23.70%) and the high relative divergence (80.3%) suggest strong outperformance. However, this needs to be viewed in context of the provided alpha/beta analysis which reveals significant volatility and potential risk.  Further analysis of the provided data is needed to properly assess this outperformance.

**1. Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Company Overview:** Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company specializing in big data analysis and software for government and commercial clients.

* **Cumulative Return Comparison:** PLTR shows a cumulative return of 170.01%, vastly exceeding the S&P 500's 23.70%.  The divergence is substantial (146.3 points), placing it at the 80.3rd percentile of historical divergence based on the provided min/max values.  This suggests exceptional performance relative to the market, but the high volatility warrants caution.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data reveals high volatility and negative alpha in the earlier periods (2020-2023), indicating underperformance against the market. However, positive CAGR and alpha are shown for 2022-2025, illustrating the significant performance swing.  The Beta values show increasing market sensitivity over time, rising from 15.2 to 293.3. This suggests increasing susceptibility to market fluctuations.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) further underscores the considerable risk associated with PLTR.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $124.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $117.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $98.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $95.40

The price is above all moving averages, indicating a potential short-term uptrend.  However, the relatively large gap between the 5-day and 20/60-day averages hints at a recent price surge.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk) suggests moderate risk.
* **RSI:** 81.04 indicates overbought conditions, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO:** 2.65 signifies strong bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +7.6 points. This confirms the short-term uptrend.
* **Expected Return:** -10.1%. This negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) seems contradictory to the high cumulative return and  positive CAGR shown in the alpha/beta analysis.  Clarification is needed on the methodology used to determine this expectation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2025-05-06 | $0.09 | $0.88 Billion |
| 2024-11-05 | $0.06 | $0.73 Billion |
| 2024-08-06 | $0.06 | $0.68 Billion |
| 2024-05-07 | $0.05 | $0.63 Billion |
| 2024-05-06 | $0.05 | $0.63 Billion *(Duplicate Entry?)*|

Revenue shows a clear upward trend.  EPS also shows growth, though more data is needed for a thorough assessment.  Note a duplicate entry in the table.

**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This absence is a significant limitation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR's performance has been remarkably volatile, with periods of significant outperformance against the S&P 500 interspersed with periods of underperformance. The high relative divergence and current price movement above moving averages suggest a short-term uptrend. However, the overbought RSI, negative long-term expected return (relative to the S&P 500), and high Beta indicate substantial risk.  The absence of key financial data further hinders a complete evaluation.  A deeper dive into the methodology behind the expected return and the reconciliation of the conflicting signals from the alpha/beta analysis and the expected return figure are crucial. The substantial volatility makes PLTR a high-risk, high-reward investment.  Further analysis with complete financial data and a clearer explanation of the conflicting metrics is required to form a sound investment opinion.
