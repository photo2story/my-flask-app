**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Palantir Technologies Inc. is a data analytics company providing software and services for government and commercial clients.  PLTR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return of 147.68% compared to VOO's 20.65%. The difference of 127.0% highlights this substantial outperformance. The relative divergence of 72.7% suggests that this level of outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance across different periods.  While recent years (2022-2025) show high CAGR and significant Alpha (outperformance relative to the benchmark), earlier periods indicate substantial underperformance (negative CAGR and large negative Alpha).  The high Beta values suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth, although this growth needs further investigation in the context of overall performance.

* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +14.3% (Short-term uptrend) - Supports the recent upward movement.
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -12.7% - This negative expected return relative to the benchmark suggests that long-term returns relative to the S&P 500 are not expected to be better than current market performance given current parameters. However, more details are needed on what assumptions were used to calculate this figure.

The 4.64$ increase in price warrants attention. While positive, such a sharp rise needs to be monitored for potential correction.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500, particularly in recent years.  However,  past performance is not indicative of future results. The high volatility (indicated by Beta) and the overbought RSI signal potential risk. While recent earnings show revenue growth, the relatively flat EPS needs further investigation. The long-term expected return is negative relative to the benchmark, requiring a deeper dive into the underlying assumptions to gain meaningful insight. The sharp recent price increase necessitates cautious monitoring for potential corrections.  A more thorough fundamental analysis, including a deeper examination of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is necessary for a comprehensive investment decision.
