**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta figures reveal PLTR's high volatility and significant outperformance compared to the market. The high beta values indicate that PLTR's price movements are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the S&P 500.  The high positive alpha suggests it has generated returns beyond what would be expected based on its beta and the market's performance. Note, however that this analysis is highly dependent on the chosen period.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B)  |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

PLTR's recent price action shows strong upward momentum:

* **Closing Price:** $65.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $61.15
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $50.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $41.12

The price is significantly above all three moving averages, suggesting a strong short-term uptrend.  The gap between the current price and the moving averages indicates a recent and potentially rapid price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (82.04):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (2.34):** A positive PPO suggests upward momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+32.4):**  Confirms short-term upward momentum.

The price of $65.78, slightly higher than the closing price, reflects this recent strong upward trend, indicating a possible recent rapid price increase or a period of strong buying pressure. The projected 0.02% expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 represents a very modest forecast.  This contrasts sharply with past performance.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

PLTR's revenue has shown steady growth.  EPS is also showing growth, though at a slower rate than revenue growth.  The most recent earnings report (2024-11-05) needs a comparison against the analyst's consensus estimates to determine whether the results beat or missed expectations.  Without this information, a complete evaluation of the recent performance is not possible.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

PLTR demonstrates significant short-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500, supported by strong revenue growth and high profit margins. However, the extremely high RSI, significant price volatility (as reflected in the beta and MDD figures), and the relatively low ROE raise concerns about potential risks.  The long-term projected return against the S&P 500 is modest despite the past outperformance.  Further investigation into the most recent earnings report (comparing actual results to analyst expectations) and recent news/analyst opinions is crucial for a comprehensive assessment. The recent strong upward movement suggests a potential for a short-term pullback due to the overbought conditions indicated by the RSI.  Careful risk management is advised.
