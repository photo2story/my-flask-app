This report analyzes Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), a data analytics company specializing in big data and software for government and commercial clients.


**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

PLTR's cumulative return (170.01%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 23.70%.  The difference is 146.3%, placing it at the 80.3rd percentile of the historical divergence range (-56.4% to 196%). This indicates PLTR's performance has been substantially higher than the S&P 500 during the observed period.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -56.0% | 70.8% | -55.0% | -0.0 | 15.2 |
| 2021-2023  | -193.0% | 70.8% | -210.0% | -0.0 | 40.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 123.0% | 70.6% | 104.0% | -0.0 | 178.5 |
| 2023-2025  | 215.0% | 70.6% | 196.0% | -0.0 | 293.3 |

The table shows high volatility (large MDD values) and significant swings in CAGR.  The consistently negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to the benchmark, despite the overall high cumulative return.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects growth, but the fluctuating CAGR highlights the risk involved.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 124.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 117.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 98.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 95.40

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The significant gap between the 5-day and 60-day averages indicates recent strong momentum.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 81.04 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a pullback)
* **PPO:** 2.65 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.6 (Short-term uptrend)
* **Expected Return:** -10.1% (Long-term expected underperformance relative to the S&P 500)

The high RSI indicates the stock may be overbought, posing a risk of a price correction.  Despite positive PPO and short-term uptrend, the negative expected return highlights the potential for long-term underperformance compared to the broader market.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2025-05-06 | $0.09 | $0.88 B      |
| 2024-11-05 | $0.06 | $0.73 B      |
| 2024-08-06 | $0.06 | $0.68 B      |
| 2024-05-07 | $0.05 | $0.63 B      |
| 2025-05-06 | $0.05 | $0.63 B      | *(Note: Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Revenue shows a generally increasing trend, though growth appears to have slowed or plateaued in the latter part of 2024.  EPS is also increasing, but the data requires verification due to the duplicate entry.  Further analysis would be required to assess revenue growth sustainably.


**5) Financial Information:**

No 'Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit' data was available. This severely limits a complete financial analysis.  Additional data is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of PLTR's financial health and profitability.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

PLTR has exhibited extremely strong performance relative to the S&P 500 over the observed period. However, this performance is characterized by high volatility and potentially unsustainable growth.  Technical indicators suggest a possible short-term uptrend, but the stock appears overbought, and the long-term expected return is negative compared to the S&P 500. The lack of crucial financial data hinders a complete assessment.  Further investigation into the company's financials and a more thorough understanding of its growth prospects are necessary before drawing conclusive investment recommendations. The high volatility makes this a high-risk investment.
