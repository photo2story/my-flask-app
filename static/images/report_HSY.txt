## Hershey Co. (HSY) Stock Review

This report analyzes Hershey Co. (HSY) stock performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and examining its recent financial performance and technical indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Hershey Co. is a leading producer of chocolate and confectionery products.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  While HSY has accumulated a return of 31.39%, VOO boasts a return of 118.37%. This represents a difference of -87.0%, placing it at the lowest percentile (0.0) of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  The provided CAGR data shows variable performance, with strong periods (73% CAGR in 2019-2021) and weaker periods (-73% CAGR projected for 2023-2025).  The alpha consistently remains near 0, suggesting the stock's performance is largely in line with market movements (beta around 0.0, though the significance needs further investigation), except for periods of unexpectedly high or low returns.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures indicate significant risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $152.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $154.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $164.64
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $173.31

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 17.77 (Significantly oversold; potential for a bounce, but also indicates potential for further decline)
* **PPO:** -0.87 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 2704.5% (This extremely high figure requires further clarification. Itâ€™s likely an error or represents an outlier scenario given the historical data, and should be treated with extreme skepticism.  A more realistic expectation would require a robust financial model incorporating risk factors and market predictions).

The current price ($152.87) is not considered a significant turning point based on provided information.  However, the combination of oversold RSI and negative PPO coupled with price movement below moving averages suggests caution. The extraordinarily high expected return needs to be investigated and validated.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data shows some variance against expectations. While some quarters exceeded expectations (2024-05-03, 2023-10-26), others fell short (2024-11-07, 2024-08-01). This inconsistency warrants further investigation into the factors contributing to these variances.  A more detailed analysis, perhaps involving a regression analysis against industry benchmarks or economic indicators, could provide additional insight.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows some variability. Profit margins are generally healthy, although they have fluctuated between quarters (40-51%).
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity is relatively stable, while ROE fluctuates, possibly reflecting seasonal or one-time factors. Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of this variability.

Both revenue and capital profitability data require deeper analysis to discern trends and identify underlying drivers. Seasonality, market conditions, and company-specific strategies all need to be considered.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

HSY is currently exhibiting a bearish trend. While the RSI indicates oversold conditions which might suggest a short-term bounce, the sustained underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative PPO,  and the price's position below its moving averages paint a concerning picture.  The exceptionally high projected return is questionable and necessitates further scrutiny.  In-depth analysis of earnings variance and deeper financial statement digging is crucial for a well-rounded assessment.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions. The high MDD values highlight significant risk.  Given the data, it is not currently advisable to buy the stock without additional, thorough fundamental and technical analysis.
