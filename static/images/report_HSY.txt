**6. Overall Analysis:**

HSY has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While showing high profit margins and relatively stable financial indicators, the inconsistent earnings, negative alpha, and current downward price trend raise concerns.  The extremely high projected return of 2001.4% needs substantial revision and a clear methodology.  Further research into the reasons for the underperformance relative to the market and the discrepancies in earnings expectations is necessary before making any investment decisions. The current oversold RSI might suggest a potential short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook requires careful consideration.  A thorough review of the provided data, including recalculating the expected return, and investigation of market factors influencing HSY's performance is crucial.
