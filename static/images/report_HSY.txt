**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Hershey Co (HSY) is a leading producer of chocolate and other confectionery products.  Over the analyzed period, HSY significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return considerably lower than the benchmark. The relative divergence indicates HSY's performance is at the lower end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), particularly 2017-2019, others, especially the most recent periods (2022-2025), show substantial negative alpha and significant maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The high beta values (mostly above 1) consistently suggest HSY's returns are highly sensitive to overall market movements.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (34.23):** Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.
* **PPO (0.0358):**  A positive value indicates bullish momentum, but it's relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+0.5):** Shows short-term upward movement in relative strength compared to the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (2001.4%):**  This exceptionally high expected return needs further clarification on its calculation methodology.  It's crucial to understand the assumptions and potential risks involved before considering this figure.  The significant negative performance against the S&P 500 over recent periods casts doubt on the reliability of this projection.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

HSY has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the analyzed period, despite showing periods of strong growth in the past. Recent earnings have missed expectations, and the stock price is trading below its moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. While the RSI indicates a potential oversold condition, the high beta and inconsistent alpha highlight significant market risk.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return requires careful scrutiny. Further investigation into the underlying assumptions and potential risks associated with this projection is critical.  Overall, a cautious approach is recommended, considering the recent underperformance and the need for clarification on the unusually high expected return figure.
