The difference is -69.7%, placing it in the 3.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market. The provided CAGR data shows significant variation across different time periods, highlighting the volatility of its performance relative to the market.  The negative CAGR in the recent periods (2022-2024 and 2023-2025) further emphasizes this underperformance.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (37.27):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.3797):**  Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+3.4):**  Shows a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (771.1%):** This exceptionally high projected return requires further investigation to ascertain its validity and underlying assumptions.  Such a high figure should be treated with extreme caution. It's crucial to understand the methodology and assumptions used to arrive at this number.  Given the historical underperformance against the S&P 500, this forecast seems unrealistic.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data reveals inconsistency in performance against expectations.  While some quarters exceeded expectations (e.g., 2024-05-03), others fell short (e.g., 2024-11-07, 2024-08-01).  There is no clear upward or downward trend in EPS, suggesting volatility in earnings.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Shows some fluctuation but generally maintains a relatively high level.
* **Profit Margin:**  Fluctuates significantly, suggesting potential challenges in maintaining consistent profitability.  The high profit margin in Q1 2024 (51.53%) is a notable outlier compared to other quarters.
* **Equity:** Generally shows stable growth.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news within the past two days, current market outlook, and analyst opinions to provide a comprehensive analysis.  This data was not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HSY has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly in the long term.  While some technical indicators suggest potential short-term upside (oversold RSI), the negative PPO and price being below moving averages indicate a bearish trend. Earnings are inconsistent, and financial ratios reveal fluctuating profitability and return on equity. The extremely high projected long-term return (771.1%) is questionable and requires more context.  Without additional news and analyst insights, a conclusive recommendation is impossible.  A thorough review of the methodology behind the 771.1% expected return is vital before considering any investment decisions.  Currently, the data suggests a cautious outlook.
