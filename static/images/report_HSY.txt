## Hershey Co (HSY) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Hershey Co (HSY), a leading confectionery company, has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly over the analyzed period. While HSY shows a cumulative return of 54.96%, VOO boasts a return of 127.58%. This results in a significant divergence of -72.62%, placing it at the 1.84 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided alpha and beta analysis shows varying performance relative to the market across different periods, with alpha often below 1, suggesting underperformance relative to the benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last market close, HSY's price was $174.81.  The 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages are $172.8, $175.93, and $185.56 respectively. This indicates a recent slight downward trend, with the price currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (46.45):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a short-term buying opportunity. However, it's not definitively bullish.
* **PPO (0.12):** A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, but the value is relatively low, indicating weak momentum.
* **Relative Strength (20-day change of +1.84):**  Shows a recent short-term upward trend relative to the S&P 500, though this is still within the context of overall underperformance.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a significant concern and warrants further investigation into the underlying assumptions. This suggests that despite potential short-term opportunities, long-term outperformance is not anticipated without substantial changes in the company's fundamentals or market conditions.  The current price of $174.81 doesn't suggest a dramatic recent price movement (neither a sharp rise nor a significant fall).

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

Hershey's recent earnings have been mixed. While some quarters exceeded expectations (e.g., Q1 2024), others fell short (e.g., Q2 2024). The most recent earnings (November 7th, 2024) showed EPS of $2.34 against an expectation of $2.56, indicating a slight miss. Consistent analysis of future earnings estimates is crucial for accurate forecasting.  Further examination of the reasons behind these variances (e.g., supply chain issues, changing consumer demand) is necessary for a comprehensive assessment.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Hershey demonstrates consistent revenue generation with fluctuating profit margins. The high profit margin in Q1 2024 (51.53%) is noteworthy, but needs to be examined in context with other factors.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Return on Equity (ROE) shows considerable variation across quarters, highlighting potential volatility in profitability.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of this volatility.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HSY has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. While some short-term indicators (RSI approaching oversold levels) might suggest a potential buying opportunity, the overall picture reveals considerable underperformance and uncertainty.  The low expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a major concern.  Thorough investigation into the reasons for the earnings inconsistencies and the rationale behind the low expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Reviewing current news, especially earnings call transcripts and analyst reports, is essential for a comprehensive risk assessment.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is warranted.  Further investigation into the causes of the recent earnings misses, and a careful assessment of the long-term growth potential relative to the S&P 500, are necessary before making investment decisions.  The current underperformance necessitates a comprehensive due diligence process, including analysis of competitive landscape, macroeconomic factors, and managementâ€™s guidance.  Only after gaining a clearer understanding of these factors can a well-informed investment strategy be formulated.
