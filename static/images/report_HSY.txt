**7. Overall Analysis:**

Hershey's recent performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly.

Missing market outlook and analyst opinion data limits the comprehensive assessment.  The provided 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 is an important point for consideration.  More extensive data and context (including revenue growth and longer-term trends) are needed for a complete assessment.  It's important to note that this analysis is limited to the provided data.
