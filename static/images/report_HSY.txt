## Hershey Co (HSY) Stock Analysis

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Hershey Co (HSY) is a leading producer of chocolate and confectionery products.  The company shows a cumulative return significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price action suggests some short-term momentum, but long-term performance relative to the market is lagging.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **HSY Cumulative Return:** 49.12%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 112.87%
* **Return Difference:** -63.7% (HSY underperformed VOO by 63.7 percentage points)
* **Relative Divergence:** 17.1% (This means HSY's underperformance relative to VOO is in the 17.1st percentile of its historical range).  While not extremely low, this still represents a significant underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values over the years.  While generally exhibiting a beta above 1 (indicating higher volatility than the market), the alpha is frequently positive, suggesting periods of outperformance. However, the recent negative CAGR (-41% to -54%) indicates significant underperformance. The high maximum drawdown (MDD) in recent years highlights considerable risk.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $172.34
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $174.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $159.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $163.72

The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  However, it's above the 20-day moving average, indicating some potential for a short-term recovery.  The recent price increase (+$0.61) indicates a minor positive shift.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 76.35  (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 1.45 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** 8.1% (+), Short-term upward trend.

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought in the short-term. The combination of an overbought RSI and a positive PPO indicates potential short-term volatility. The recent price increase needs to be considered in this context, suggesting potential short-term fluctuations, rather than a sustained uptrend.  The expected return of 114.3% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant positive factor, however, this needs to be considered cautiously given the recent underperformance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin (%) |

| 2023-12-31 | $2.66       | 42.27             |

Revenue fluctuates, and profit margins show some variability.  The recent quarter (2024-12-31) shows a high profit margin, possibly indicating strong operational efficiency or favorable pricing. Further investigation of the factors influencing revenue and margins is necessary.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $4.71       | 16.90   |

| 2023-12-31 | $4.10       | 8.52    |

Equity has generally increased, and ROE also shows variation but remains positive.  This suggests reasonable financial health, although further investigation is needed to assess the sustainability of these trends.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

HSY has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in recent years. While some short-term indicators suggest potential for upward movement, the overbought RSI and the recent negative CAGR raise concerns. The long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is positive, however, this projection should be cautiously considered in light of the current market conditions and recent underperformance. A comprehensive analysis of the factors influencing the recent negative performance, along with a deeper dive into the financial statements, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Further evaluation of industry trends and competitive pressures is also warranted.
