## Hershey Co (HSY) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Hershey Co (HSY), a leading producer of confectionery and snack foods, based on the provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

HSY's cumulative return (52.18%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 108.99%.  The difference is -56.8%, placing it at the 20.9th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (where a range of -94.8% to 86.6% is normalized to 0-100%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals varying performance characteristics across different periods. While HSY exhibited positive Alpha (outperformance relative to the market) in several periods, particularly between 2017-2020, recent periods (2022-2025) show negative CAGR and significantly negative Alpha, indicating underperformance.  The high Beta values (generally above 1) suggest HSY's price movements are more volatile than the overall market.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) from 2015 to 2022 reflects growth, but this growth hasn't translated consistently into outperformance against the S&P 500.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 20.0% | 5.5% | -9.0% | 19.4 |
| 2016-2018  | 19.0% | 8.2% | 1.0% | 18.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 38.0% | 8.2% | 7.0% | 26.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 36.0% | 8.2% | 9.0% | 28.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 72.0% | 7.0% | 1.0% | 36.3 |
| 2020-2022  | 52.0% | 7.0% | 44.0% | 44.3 |
| 2021-2023  | 19.0% | 7.0% | -4.0% | 36.4 |
| 2022-2024  | -41.0% | 7.0% | -74.0% | 34.0 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $176.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $174.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $163.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $163.70

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, the recent closing price is slightly below the previous close, indicating a minor decline.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.23 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.98 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +2.6% (Short-term upward momentum)

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and prone to a correction.  However, the positive PPO and the recent relative strength suggest continued short-term upward momentum.  The provided data shows a significant negative price change (-$1.18) from the previous close, which should be considered when evaluating current momentum. This change, while not catastrophic, contributes to a more cautious short term outlook.  The expected return of 87.5% over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500 is a significant claim and requires more detailed justification and context to be considered reliable.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-02-06 | 2.69     | 2.4          | +0.29      |

| 2024-02-08 | 2.02     | 1.95          | +0.07      |

Earnings have been inconsistent, with both positive and negative surprises relative to expectations.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying drivers of these variations.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.89B    | 53.97%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $2.99B    | 41.26%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $2.66B    | 42.27%        |

Revenue fluctuates, but generally appears healthy.  Profit margins also show variability, suggesting potential challenges in maintaining consistent profitability.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE          |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $4.71B    | 16.90%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $4.20B    | 10.61%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $4.10B    | 8.52%         |

Equity is generally increasing, but ROE fluctuates, reflecting the variations in profitability.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

HSY's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly in recent periods. While some periods show positive alpha and strong revenue, inconsistent profitability and recent negative trends raise concerns. The high beta suggests substantial market risk.  Technical indicators show mixed signals:  short-term momentum is positive, but RSI suggests potential overvaluation.  The projected long-term outperformance needs further substantiation. A thorough analysis of the factors driving earnings variability and profit margin fluctuations is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.  Further investigation into the substantial claim of 87.5% long-term return is necessary before considering the validity of this assertion.
