* **Last Market Price:** 172.78
* **5-day Moving Average:** 173.91
* **20-day Moving Average:** 175.63
* **60-day Moving Average:** 185.3

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price (175.54 vs 172.78) indicates a slight positive movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.93 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.21 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** 1.3 (+), suggesting short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This is a crucial data point missing from the provided context,  without a defined methodology, this zero return figure is meaningless).

A simple subtraction of the S&P 500 return from HSY's projected return won't account for risk differences.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires real-time data.  Please provide recent news sources for a complete analysis.  I cannot access real-time information, including news articles from sources like Shacknews or Finbold.)*  A search of recent news articles and analyst opinions on Hershey's performance and outlook is needed to complete this section.  This should include discussions on recent earnings announcements and market forecasts.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Hershey Co shows a history of strong profit margins and relatively stable revenue. However, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, and its high beta indicates substantial risk.  While the alpha suggests past outperformance, consistency is lacking. Recent EPS results have been mixed, and the current price is below several key moving averages.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly positive short-term outlook.  The missing expected return and a lack of recent news analysis prevent a definitive conclusion on its long-term investment potential. A thorough examination of recent news and analyst opinions, along with a more detailed analysis of the provided expected return calculation is vital before making any investment decision.
