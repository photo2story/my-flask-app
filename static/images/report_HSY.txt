## Hershey Co (HSY) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

HSY's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While HSY showed a positive return, its performance lagged considerably behind the market benchmark.  Recent price action indicates a short-term upward trend, but several indicators suggest caution.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Hershey Co (HSY) is a leading producer of chocolate and confectionery products.

* **Cumulative Returns:** HSY: 48.31%; VOO: 118.31%.  The difference is -70.0%, placing it in the 13.7th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market),  others show negative alpha and a relatively high beta (19-20 in some periods), implying significant market sensitivity. The recent negative CAGR and substantial MDD (maximum drawdown) highlight significant risk. The extremely high MDD values in the 2022-2025 period (-74% and -114%) are particularly concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $172.86
* **5-day Moving Average:** $164.75
* **20-day Moving Average:** $155.29
* **60-day Moving Average:** $164.87

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it is relatively close to the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance.  The significant price increase from the previous close ($166.1 to $172.86) indicates a recent sharp upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 79.68 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a pullback)
* **PPO:** 1.70 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +7.7 (Positive, confirming short-term upward trend)

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought, increasing the risk of a price correction.  The recent price surge ($4.07 increase) supports the positive short-term momentum but necessitates caution due to potential overvaluation. The expected return of 152% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 seems overly optimistic and requires more detailed justification based on a robust financial model.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-02-06 | $2.69   | $2.4         | +$0.29      |
| 2024-11-07 | $2.34   | $2.56        | -$0.22      |
| 2024-08-01 | $1.27   | $1.44        | -$0.17      |
| 2024-05-03 | $3.07   | $2.76        | +$0.31      |
| 2024-02-08 | $2.02   | $1.95        | +$0.07      |

Earnings have been inconsistent, with some quarters exceeding expectations and others falling short.  There's no clear trend indicating consistent outperformance or underperformance.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue fluctuates, suggesting seasonality. Profit margins show considerable variation, ranging from 40% to 54%, likely influenced by cost fluctuations and seasonal demand.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable. Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile, reflecting the impact of varying profitability across quarters.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HSY's recent price action shows a short-term upward trend, but several factors warrant caution:

* **Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** HSY significantly lagged the market benchmark over the analyzed period.
* **High RSI:** Suggests the stock might be overbought.
* **Volatile Earnings:**  Inconsistent earnings performance indicates uncertainty.
* **High Beta:** Shows substantial market sensitivity, implying increased risk.
* **Extremely high MDD in recent periods:**  Significant downside risk is evident.
* **Overly optimistic long-term expected return:** The projected 152% return needs more in-depth analysis and justification.


While the short-term outlook might appear positive due to the recent price surge,  a long-term investment decision should consider the historical underperformance relative to the market, the high beta, significant risk, and the lack of consistent earnings growth.  Further research, including a thorough assessment of future growth prospects and valuation metrics, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The provided projected return of 152% appears unrealistic without substantial supporting evidence.
