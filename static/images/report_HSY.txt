Here's a comprehensive analysis of Hershey Co. (HSY) based on the provided data, presented as a report.

**Hershey Co. (HSY) Investment Analysis Report**

**1. Executive Summary:**

Hershey Co. (HSY), a leading producer of chocolate and confectionery products, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period. While exhibiting periods of strong growth, recent performance shows a substantial decline.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, but fundamental analysis requires further investigation due to mixed signals from earnings and financial data.  A significant long-term investment would require a reassessment of the current market conditions and future prospects for the company.


**2. Performance Relative to S&P 500:**

The cumulative return for HSY (31.39%) is considerably lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO) (118.37%). This represents a substantial underperformance of -87.0%, placing it at the lowest percentile (0.0%) compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data. The provided Alpha values of 0 suggest that HSY has not generated excess returns above the market (S&P 500), which is consistent with the underperformance observed.  The Beta values consistently around 0.0 are inconsistent with the reported actual performance relative to VOO, and may reflect errors in the provided data.


**3. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $152.87
* **5-day Moving Average:** $154.25
* **20-day Moving Average:** $164.64
* **60-day Moving Average:** $173.31

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages suggests recent price volatility.  The significant gap between the closing price and the 60-day moving average highlights the extent of the recent decline.  The price drop of -$0.75 from the previous close indicates a minor negative change.

**4. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (17.77):**  This extremely low RSI value strongly suggests the stock is significantly oversold.
* **PPO (-0.87):**  The negative PPO value confirms the bearish trend.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence (0.0 -):**  Indicates a recent short-term decline.

The combination of low RSI and negative PPO values strongly points to an oversold condition. However, it is important to consider that oversold conditions can persist.

**5. Expected Return:**

The provided expected return of 2704.5% over a long-term horizon (2+ years) appears exceptionally high and requires further investigation into the methodology used for this calculation.  This value should be viewed with extreme skepticism, and its credibility evaluated.

**6. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a mixed picture. While some quarters exceeded expectations (e.g., 2024-05-03), others fell short (e.g., 2024-11-07, 2024-08-01). This inconsistency makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the company's earnings trajectory without further analysis.  There is no apparent trend, necessitating a deeper look at the factors driving the variability in EPS.

**7. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates across quarters, but profit margins are generally high (above 40%), though they show some variability and a dip in Q2 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable, with ROE fluctuating but generally positive.  Similar to earnings, there is no clear trend, and consistency in ROE is lacking.


**8. Overall Conclusion:**

HSY's recent performance has been poor, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. While technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, raising the possibility of a bounce, the inconsistency in earnings and financial performance creates uncertainty. The extraordinarily high projected long-term return requires critical review and validation.  Further fundamental analysis, including a thorough examination of the company's strategy, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The exceptionally high expected return should be viewed with extreme caution and requires independent verification before consideration.  The provided Beta values also necessitate further investigation as they appear to be inconsistent with the actual performance relative to the S&P 500.
