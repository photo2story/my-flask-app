**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Hershey Co (HSY) is a leading producer of chocolate and confectionery products.  The following analysis examines its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) based on provided data.  Note that some data points, especially the projected figures, may carry significant uncertainty.

**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **HSY Cumulative Return:** 52.58%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 117.28%
* **Return Difference:** -64.7%  (HSY underperformed VOO significantly).
* **Relative Divergence:** 16.6% (This means HSY's underperformance relative to VOO is in the 16.6th percentile of the historical range of divergence, implying a relatively low level of underperformance compared to past periods of deviation).

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows mixed results.  While some periods demonstrate positive alpha (outperformance), others show significant negative alpha, especially recently (2022-2025 projection). Beta consistently remains high (around 0.2-0.3) indicating relatively high sensitivity to market movements.  The company's market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally increased over time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $177.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $168.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $156.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $164.92

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  The recent change of $2.88 (+1.67%) suggests a recent price surge.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 84.71 (Overbought condition, suggesting potential for a short-term price correction).
* **PPO:** 1.95 (Positive value indicating bullish momentum).
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +12.0 (Strong recent short-term upward movement).
* **Expected Return:** 119.7% (This represents the projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500.  The high value warrants skepticism unless the underlying assumptions are well-justified and the model robust).  The recent price surge needs to be factored into this projection, potentially adjusting downward the long-term expected return estimate.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HSY has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered. While recent price action shows strength (above moving averages, recent price surge, positive PPO), RSI indicates an overbought condition suggesting potential for a correction.  Earnings have been mixed, and financial metrics reveal fluctuations requiring further analysis.  The projected high long-term excess return requires careful consideration given the inherent uncertainties in such projections.  Investors should conduct further due diligence, including examining the companyâ€™s competitive landscape, management quality, and broader economic factors, before making any investment decisions.  The high beta suggests a higher level of risk associated with the investment.
