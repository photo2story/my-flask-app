**7. Overall Summary & Conclusion**

Hershey has experienced significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 recently, despite generally exceeding EPS estimates and maintaining strong profit margins. The technical indicators suggest it may be approaching oversold conditions. The low MRI rating suggests low market risk, making the stock attractive to those looking for high returns.
However, investors should closely monitor news and company announcements, as recent volatility and the decline in relative performance (as measured by alpha) indicate that the stock is susceptible to fluctuations in the market. The low RSI rating might mean a buying opportunity, although the moving averages indicate a downward trend and that more research is needed before making any investment decisions. The high rate of return also merits attention and should be investigated before making any investment decisions.
