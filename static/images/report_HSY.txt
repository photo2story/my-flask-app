**Analysis:** The table reveals a concerning trend.  Recent years (2022-2025) show negative CAGR and significant negative Alpha, indicating poor performance relative to the market. Beta is relatively low, suggesting the stock is less volatile than the market overall, but the negative Alpha offsets this benefit.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movements**

*   **Current Price:** 164.91
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 164.91, 'previousClose': 164.76, 'change': 0.09} (Slight increase)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 163.66
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 169.27
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 165.43

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly above its 5-day moving average but below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a possible short-term upward trend, but the longer-term averages indicate potential downward pressure.  The small change from the previous close indicates no significant immediate price event.

*   **20-Day Relative Differential Change:** -10.9 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 1079.0%

**Analysis:** The RSI is approaching oversold territory, which could indicate a potential buying opportunity.  The negative PPO suggests negative momentum. The "Hybrid Signal" recommends a high cash position and a small sell-off, indicating caution. The negative change in relative differential supports the short-term decline observation. Despite the short-term caution, the exceptionally high expected return suggests significant long-term potential if a strategic investment approach is adopted.

*   **Long-Term Potential (High Risk/High Reward):** The extraordinarily high expected return suggests the stock has potential upside if you invest for the long term (2+ years). However, it's critical to recognize the significant risk implied by the negative Alpha and recent underperformance.
*   **Further Investigation:** Conduct thorough due diligence to understand the underlying drivers of the recent performance issues and evaluate the company's plans to address them.
