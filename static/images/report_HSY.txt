Here's a comprehensive analysis of Hershey Co. (HSY) based on the provided data, formatted as a report.

**Hershey Co. (HSY) Stock Analysis Report**

**1. Performance Summary and Relative Strength:**

Hershey Co. (HSY) is a leading producer of chocolate and confectionery products.  Over the analyzed period, HSY's cumulative return of 29.54% significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 52.12%. This represents a difference of -22.6%, placing it in the 8th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (-23.8% to 134.9%).  While the alpha is consistently around 1.0 across the given periods, suggesting performance similar to the market, the beta values indicate varying sensitivity to market movements.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (S&P 500) based on CAGR, MDD (Maximum Drawdown) and Alpha/Beta calculations.  The high CAGR of 77% in 2020-2022 is misleading if the  -73% CAGR in 2023-2025 and other losses are considered.   Further investigation into market conditions and company-specific events impacting these periods is crucial.  Fluctuations in Beta suggest varying market sensitivity throughout these periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $150.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $151.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $160.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $171.35

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase of $0.55 (0.37%) from the previous close, while positive, doesn't alter the overall downward trend indicated by moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 15.42 - This extremely low RSI value indicates the stock is significantly oversold.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.52 - A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** -0.6 (Short-term downward trend).
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 7864.3% -  This extremely high expected return relative to the S&P 500 requires significant scrutiny.  The calculation methodology is not provided, and such a high figure is highly improbable and warrants further investigation into the assumptions used in its calculation. The claim should be treated with extreme skepticism.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data shows mixed results compared to expectations. While some quarters exceeded expectations (2024-05-03, 2023-10-26), others fell short (2024-11-07, 2024-08-01, 2024-02-08).  There is no clear trend of consistent outperformance or underperformance of estimates. More context (e.g., macroeconomic factors, industry trends) is needed to fully interpret these results.


| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|--------------|------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 2.34   | 2.56         | -0.22       |
| 2024-08-01 | 1.27   | 1.44         | -0.17       |
| 2024-05-03 | 3.07   | 2.76         | +0.31       |
| 2024-02-08 | 2.02   | 1.95         | +0.07       |
| 2023-10-26 | 2.60   | 2.45         | +0.15       |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals some inconsistencies. While revenue shows some fluctuation, profit margins are generally healthy, ranging from 40.19% to 51.53%.  Equity is relatively stable, while ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, indicating variations in profitability based on the capital employed.  Further analysis would benefit from trend analysis and comparison to industry peers.

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Profit margins are relatively stable and strong, indicating efficient operations.


**Capital and Profitability:**  ROE shows some volatility, requiring further analysis to determine the underlying causes of these fluctuations.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

HSY currently displays mixed signals.  While strong profit margins and historically healthy financials are positive indicators, the recent price action, low RSI, negative PPO, and underperformance compared to the S&P 500 raise concerns.  The highly improbable projected return necessitates further clarification.  Thorough investigation into the reasons for the discrepancies between actual and expected EPS, along with a comparative analysis against industry benchmarks, is crucial for a complete assessment. The extremely high expected return figure should be disregarded until a verifiable calculation method is provided.  A deeper dive into macroeconomic factors and competitive pressures impacting the company's performance is recommended.

**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data provided, HSY presents a complex picture. While fundamental financial metrics appear relatively strong, recent price performance and technical indicators point towards bearish momentum.  The highly unusual expected return claim requires verification and further investigation.  A more in-depth analysis incorporating additional data points and competitive landscape comparisons is highly recommended before making any investment decisions.
