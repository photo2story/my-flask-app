## Hershey Co. (HSY) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Hershey Co. (HSY) is a leading confectionery company producing chocolate and other sweets.  The cumulative return of HSY is 35.18%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.47%.  The difference in cumulative returns is -77.3%, placing it at the 0th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided Alpha values of consistently 0.0 suggest the stock's returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta) and lacks significant outperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $157.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $161.99
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $170.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $175.30

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (23.83):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.78):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (-1.8):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2724.8%):** This extraordinarily high figure likely needs clarification or correction. It's unrealistic to expect such a dramatic outperformance over the long term, especially given the historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Further information on the calculation methodology is required.  The current price of $157.28 does not indicate any immediate 급반등 (sharp rebound) or 급하락 (sharp decline), but the confluence of low RSI and negative PPO alongside the price being below moving averages suggests caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data shows some variability. While some quarters exceeded expectations (e.g., Q1 2024), others fell short (e.g., Q3 and Q4 2024).  A consistent trend is not readily apparent, requiring further analysis and potentially considering macroeconomic factors influencing the confectionery market.


| Date       | EPS   | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|-------|--------------|------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 2.34  | 2.56         | Miss       |
| 2024-08-01 | 1.27  | 1.44         | Miss       |
| 2024-05-03 | 3.07  | 2.76         | Beat       |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has been relatively stable, fluctuating around $3 Billion per quarter. Profit margins have been consistently strong, generally between 40% and 50%. However, there is some variability in profitability, potentially influenced by seasonal demand or cost fluctuations.  ROE (Return on Equity) shows similar volatility, ranging from approximately 4% to 19%, implying some inconsistency in capital efficiency.  More investigation into these fluctuations is needed.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HSY has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period.  While the stock is currently in oversold territory (RSI), this doesn't necessarily guarantee a rebound.  The negative PPO and downtrend indicated by moving averages suggest continued bearish pressure.  Earnings have shown inconsistency, and while profit margins are healthy, ROE volatility indicates some operational uncertainty. The extremely high projected return of 2724.8% requires critical evaluation and further explanation.  Overall, a cautious approach is warranted, and further research into industry trends and company-specific factors is needed before considering any investment.  The extremely high projected return and the consistently 0 Alpha needs further clarification and validation.  The historical data shows significant underperformance against the market benchmark.
