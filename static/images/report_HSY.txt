## Hershey Co. (HSY) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Hershey Co. (HSY) is a leading producer of chocolate and confectionery products.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period. While the company shows periods of strong CAGR, recent performance has been significantly negative.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind this divergence.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **HSY Cumulative Return:** 35.46%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 121.84%
* **Return Difference:** -86.4%  (The current relative divergence of -86.4% places it at the 4.6th percentile of historical divergence, indicating significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.)

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values suggest a high beta (market sensitivity) for HSY, especially in earlier periods. While positive alpha was observed in some years, recent years show negative alpha, underperforming the market. The high CAGR values in some periods are notable, but the extremely negative CAGR in the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods is a serious concern.  The massive Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures in the later years further highlight the risk involved.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 20.0% | 5.8% | -9.0% | 19.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 19.0% | 8.2% | 1.0% | 19.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 38.0% | 8.2% | 7.0% | 26.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 36.0% | 8.2% | 9.0% | 28.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 72.0% | 6.9% | 1.0% | 36.6 |

* **Closing Price:** 157.88
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 157.90
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 152.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 165.26

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent sideways or slightly downward momentum.  It is also below the 60-day moving average, further confirming a downward trend in the medium term.  The distance from the 20-day average is more significant indicating a more significant recent trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 55.93 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** 1.24 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, although the magnitude needs to be considered in context.)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.5  (Slight negative divergence indicates weakening short-term upward momentum.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 524.8% (This extremely high projected return needs significant caution. It is crucial to understand the methodology and assumptions underlying this forecast. The extremely high projected return may be influenced by the historical underperformance.)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-02-06 | 2.69    | 2.4          | 0.29       |
| 2024-11-07 | 2.34    | 2.56         | -0.22      |
| 2024-08-01 | 1.27    | 1.44         | -0.17      |
| 2024-05-03 | 3.07    | 2.76         | 0.31       |
| 2024-02-08 | 2.02    | 1.95         | 0.07       |

Earnings have been inconsistent, sometimes exceeding and sometimes falling short of expectations.  A deeper dive into the reasons for these variances is necessary.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data severely limits a comprehensive financial analysis. This missing information is a crucial gap in the provided data.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

HSY's recent performance significantly lags the S&P 500. While historical periods show high CAGR, the recent negative CAGR and high MDD values are alarming.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook, but the long-term outlook is unclear. The missing financial data hinders a thorough assessment. The extremely high projected long-term return requires extreme skepticism and further investigation into the methodology.  A more complete financial statement and an in-depth analysis of the reasons behind the recent underperformance are necessary to make a well-informed investment decision.
