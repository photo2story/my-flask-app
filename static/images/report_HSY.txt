| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                      |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| 2015-2017  | 20.0% | 5.8% | -9.0% | 19.6 |       | Significantly underperformed the market.     |
| 2016-2018  | 19.0% | 8.2% | 1.0% | 19.0 |       | Slightly outperformed the market.         |
| 2017-2019  | 38.0% | 8.2% | 7.0% | 26.7 |       | Significantly outperformed the market.         |
| 2018-2020  | 36.0% | 8.2% | 9.0% | 28.3 |       | Significantly outperformed the market.         |
| 2019-2021  | 72.0% | 6.9% | 1.0% | 36.6 |       | Significantly outperformed the market.         |
| 2020-2022  | 52.0% | 6.9% | 44.0% | 44.6 |       | Significantly outperformed the market despite high MDD. |
| 2021-2023  | 19.0% | 7.0% | -4.0% | 36.6 |       | Underperformed the market.                  |
| 2022-2024  | -41.0% | 7.0% | -74.0% | 34.3 |       | Significantly underperformed the market.    |
| 2023-2025  | -67.0% | 11.4% | -130.0%| 31.9 |       | Significantly underperformed the market.   |


HSY shows periods of significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the market, highlighting its high beta (volatility) and inconsistent alpha generation.  The extremely high negative CAGR in the last two periods is concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 157.88
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 157.9
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 152.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 165.26

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting recent minor downward pressure. It's also below its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.  The 20-day average being below both indicates a more established downtrend within the recent past.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.93 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.24 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -0.5 (Indicates recent weakening momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 524.8% (This extremely high number needs further clarification and validation.  It seems unrealistic and likely requires additional context regarding the calculation methodology.)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO is positive, the negative relative strength change and relatively neutral RSI suggest caution. The extremely high expected return requires further justification.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference | Note                                     |
|------------|---------|---------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2025-02-06 | 2.69    | 2.4           | 0.29        | Beat expectations                             |
| 2024-11-07 | 2.34    | 2.56          | -0.22       | Missed expectations                           |
| 2024-08-01 | 1.27    | 1.44          | -0.17       | Missed expectations                           |
| 2024-05-03 | 3.07    | 2.76          | 0.31        | Beat expectations                             |
| 2024-02-08 | 2.02    | 1.95          | 0.07        | Beat expectations                             |

Earnings have been inconsistent, with both beats and misses of expectations.  Further analysis, considering revenue and other financial metrics would help in understanding the driving factors behind EPS performance.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits the ability to perform a comprehensive financial analysis.  These crucial metrics are essential for assessing the company's financial health and profitability.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

HSY's performance has been highly volatile, with periods of strong outperformance and significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The recent negative CAGR is a serious concern. While some positive technical indicators are present, the lack of key financial data and the highly questionable expected return figure hinder a robust assessment.  A deeper dive into the company's fundamentals, including revenue, gross profit, and a detailed explanation of the 524.8% expected return, is necessary before drawing definitive conclusions.  The high beta suggests significant risk.  Caution is advised.
