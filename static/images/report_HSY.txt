## Hershey Co (HSY) Stock Review

This report analyzes Hershey Co (HSY), a leading producer of chocolate and confectionery products, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Hershey's cumulative return of 32.38% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return of 116.43% over the analyzed period.  The provided data shows a substantial lag of -84.0 percentage points, placing it at the 1.3 percentile of the historical range of its relative performance against the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided CAGR data further illustrates this underperformance, particularly in recent years (2022-2025 showing a projected -72% CAGR).  The Alpha consistently being 0.0 suggests the company's returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last market close, HSY's price was $154.02.  The 5-day moving average is $155.31, the 20-day moving average is $165.88, and the 60-day moving average is $173.81.  This shows a clear downward trend in the short to medium term, with the current price significantly below all three moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (18.34):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound.
* **PPO (-0.94):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** The positive short-term relative strength (+1.3) is contradictory to the negative longer-term trend. This inconsistency suggests potential short-term upward pressure while the broader trend is down.

The current price ($154.02) is below the moving averages indicating potential downside risks.  The projected 2044.1% expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 needs significant clarification, as it's exceptionally high and likely based on a highly optimistic scenario not reflected in recent performance or the current market conditions.  Itâ€™s crucial to understand the underlying assumptions for this projection.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|--------------|------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 2.34   | 2.56         | -0.22       |
| 2024-08-01 | 1.27   | 1.44         | -0.17       |
| 2024-05-03 | 3.07   | 2.76         | +0.31       |
| 2024-02-08 | 2.02   | 1.95         | +0.07       |
| 2023-10-26 | 2.60   | 2.45         | +0.15       |

In general, EPS has fallen short of expectations, except for a few quarters.  This inconsistency in meeting EPS expectations further points to the volatility and uncertainty currently surrounding the company.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some variability, while profit margins are consistently high, indicating strong pricing power and operational efficiency. However, profitability has fluctuated throughout the observed quarters.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable, and ROE, although showing some fluctuation, is generally positive, suggesting a reasonable return on invested capital.  However, the ROE has decreased from 19.41% in Q1 2024 to 10.61% in Q3 2024 showing signs of slowing profitability.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HSY shows signs of short term oversold conditions, however this needs to be considered carefully due to the long-term negative trends. The stock is currently underperforming the broader market significantly, showing a consistent downward trend, falling short of EPS expectations and displaying volatility in revenue and profitability.  The extremely high projected long-term expected return requires additional context and justification.  The oversold RSI could suggest a short-term bounce, but the broader picture is one of significant underperformance and considerable risk.  Before making any investment decision, further investigation is required to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and the validity of the exceptionally high projected return.  A deeper dive into the company's strategies and competitive landscape is necessary to assess its long-term prospects.
