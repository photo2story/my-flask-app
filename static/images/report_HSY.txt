*   **CAGR:** Recent CAGR is trending negative.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is high, indicating significant volatility and potential for losses.

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 170.24
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 165.63

**Analysis:**

*   The stock is trading below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60 day), indicating a short-term and medium-term downtrend.
*   The significant negative change at the last market close suggests strong selling pressure. The large price drop from 169.93 to 161.97 is a substantial move that could indicate a notable negative catalyst.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3373 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 39.29 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.1853
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash 0%, Buy 80% of cash (1 share - Caution - MRI: 0.33)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 3.7 (+) - Short term increase
*   **Expected Return:** 161.6% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500, if dollar-cost averaging)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  The low MRI suggests relatively low overall market risk impacting HSY.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is below 40, indicating the stock is approaching oversold territory, which *could* signal a potential bounce, but this needs confirmation.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO value shows that price is currently below its historical average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The hybrid signal suggests buying 80% of the cash available, but the "Caution" flag and the MRI reading highlight a balanced, but slightly positive, outlook.
*   **Recent Divergence:**  The increase in relative divergence over the past 20 days suggests a potential short-term upward trend relative to the S&P 500, although the recent price drop might offset this.
*   **Expected Return:**  The very high expected return figure should be viewed with caution.  It implies a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term, but this is likely based on specific models and assumptions.  It's important to understand the methodology behind this projection.
*   **Price Change Issue:** The large negative price change at the last close (price dropped from 169.93 to 161.97) indicates a possible negative event. This recent price decline warrants consideration.

**Recommendation (Disclaimer: This is for informational purposes only and not financial advice):**

Given the recent negative price action, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and the mixed financial indicators, a cautious approach to HSY is warranted.

Further research into the company's long-term strategy and its response to market challenges is recommended. The high "expected return" should be viewed with skepticism until the underlying assumptions are fully understood.
