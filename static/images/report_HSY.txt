## Hershey Co (HSY) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:** Hershey Co (HSY), a leading confectionery company, significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While exhibiting periods of strong growth, recent performance has been weak, and key indicators warrant careful consideration before investment.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Hershey's cumulative return of 30.71% pales in comparison to the S&P 500's 120.63% return.  This represents a significant underperformance (-89.9%), placing it at the 2.7th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 (based on the provided relative divergence).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance, with periods of positive alpha (outperformance) followed by substantial negative returns.  The high beta (generally above 0.2, often exceeding 1) indicates high sensitivity to market movements.  The substantial negative CAGR in recent years (2022-2025) is alarming.  Capitalization has increased over time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $152.34
* **Last Market Price:** $154.68 (a $1.53 increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $148.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $152.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $167.21

The price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting potential short-term upward momentum but a longer-term downtrend.  The recent price increase of $1.53 is notable.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.36 (slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.25 (positive, indicating potential upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.7 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 934.6% (This extremely high figure warrants further investigation and scrutiny. It needs to be contextualized within a realistic investment model, considering inherent market risks and future uncertainties.)  The statement that this represents excess return over the S&P 500 implies a significant outperformance. Given the prior data, this forecast requires rigorous justification.

The recent price jump needs consideration. While positive, it requires further analysis to determine if it represents a sustainable trend or a temporary fluctuation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data show inconsistency. While some quarters exceed expectations, others fall short.  A consistent pattern is not clearly established.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-02-06 | 2.69 | 2.4 | +0.29 |
| 2024-11-07 | 2.34 | 2.56 | -0.22 |
| 2024-08-01 | 1.27 | 1.44 | -0.17 |
| 2024-05-03 | 3.07 | 2.76 | +0.31 |
| 2024-02-08 | 2.02 | 1.95 | +0.07 |

Further investigation into the reasons behind these variations is needed.


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some fluctuation, but profitability (profit margin) also reveals inconsistency.  ROE (Return on Equity) is equally volatile.  While some quarters display high profitability and ROE, others are significantly lower.  A deeper dive is needed to understand the drivers of this variability.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $2.99 | 41.26% |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.07 | 40.19% |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.25 | 51.53% |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.66 | 42.27% |
| 2023-09-30 | $3.03 | 44.89% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $4.20 | 10.61% |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.01 | 4.51% |
| 2024-03-31 | $4.11 | 19.41% |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.10 | 8.52% |
| 2023-09-30 | $3.97 | 13.07% |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Hershey's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500, despite periods of strong growth in previous years.  The high beta suggests substantial market risk.  While some indicators point towards potential short-term upward momentum, the overall picture reveals inconsistency in earnings, profitability, and ROE.  The extremely high projected long-term return requires substantial further justification.  Before investing, a thorough review of macroeconomic factors, competitive landscape, and a detailed analysis of the causes of fluctuating performance are crucial.  The currently available data presents a mixed and concerning outlook.
