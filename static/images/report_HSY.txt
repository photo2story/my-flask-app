## Hershey Co (HSY) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Hershey Co (HSY), a leading confectionery company, significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While the S&P 500 experienced a cumulative return of 120.36%, HSY's cumulative return was only 31.99%. This represents a substantial divergence of -88.4%, placing it at the 0th percentile of the historical range of divergence between the two.  The provided Alpha values consistently show near zero, suggesting the stock's performance is largely explained by market movements (Beta is not explicitly provided as a single value, but implied from the provided CAGR data).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last reported data point, HSY closed at $153.57. Recent price movements show:

* **5-day moving average:** $153.50
* **20-day moving average:** $163.70
* **60-day moving average:** $172.84

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The small positive change from the previous close ($0.46) is not significant enough to reverse this trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The technical indicators paint a bearish picture:

* **RSI (14.98):**  Suggests the stock is significantly oversold.
* **PPO (-0.73):** Indicates negative momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (0.0 -):** Shows a recent short-term decline.


The projected long-term (2+ years) expected return of 2699.1% relative to the S&P 500 appears exceptionally high and should be treated with significant skepticism.  This figure needs further clarification regarding its calculation methodology and underlying assumptions before it can be considered reliable.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals some inconsistencies:

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 2.34   | 2.56         | -0.22       |
| 2024-08-01 | 1.27   | 1.44         | -0.17       |
| 2024-05-03 | 3.07   | 2.76         | +0.31       |
| 2024-02-08 | 2.02   | 1.95         | +0.07       |
| 2023-10-26 | 2.60   | 2.45         | +0.15       |

While there are instances of exceeding expectations, the recent trend shows a pattern of missing analyst estimates.  Further investigation into the reasons for these misses is necessary.


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows a generally healthy company with some recent fluctuations:

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates between quarters, but remains strong overall. Profit margins are also quite high, generally exceeding 40%.  The drop in profit margin in Q2 2024 warrants further investigation.

**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity remains relatively stable, indicating a solid financial position. ROE (Return on Equity) shows some volatility, but generally sits within a reasonable range.  The significant drop in ROE in Q2 2024  needs to be analyzed in conjunction with revenue and profit margin figures.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

HSY currently exhibits mixed signals. While the company demonstrates strong fundamentals (high profit margins, relatively stable equity), its recent stock performance has significantly lagged the market. The negative technical indicators and inconsistent earnings suggest caution. The exceptionally high projected long-term return requires careful scrutiny and validation.  A thorough examination of Q2 2024's financial performance is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the current situation.  Before making any investment decisions, a deeper dive into the reasons behind the recent underperformance is recommended.  Consider further analysis of macroeconomic factors impacting the confectionery industry and competitor performance.
