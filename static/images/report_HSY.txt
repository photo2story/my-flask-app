## Hershey Co (HSY) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Overview:**

Hershey Co (HSY) is a leading producer of chocolate and confectionery products.  The cumulative return of HSY (33.49%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (112.74%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is a substantial -79.3%, placing it at the lowest percentile (0.0%) of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows periods of strong performance alongside periods of significant underperformance, especially in recent years (2022-2025).  The consistently low or zero Alpha suggests the stock's returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta), reflecting a relatively low risk-adjusted return compared to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last reported data point, HSY's closing price is $155.31.  The stock price is trading below its 5-day ($159.71), 20-day ($168.66), and 60-day ($174.83) moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (17.40):**  This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound. However, it's crucial to consider other factors before interpreting this as a strong buy signal.
* **PPO (-0.87):** A negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** The recent 20-day relative strength change of 0.0 indicates a short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return (2719.8%):** The extraordinarily high expected return needs further clarification. This figure is likely an anomaly, possibly due to a miscalculation or an unrealistic long-term projection that doesn't account for potential market fluctuations or company-specific risks. A more conservative and realistic projection should be considered.  It is extremely important to avoid interpreting this value literally as a highly probable outcome.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows mixed results. While some quarters exceeded EPS expectations (e.g., Q1 2024), others fell short (e.g., Q3 and Q4 2024).  While some beats were significant, consistently missing targets raises concerns about the company's ability to consistently meet or exceed expectations.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for these variances is needed.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HSY is currently underperforming the S&P 500, showing a significant negative divergence. While technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce due to oversold conditions, the longer-term trend seems bearish. The inconsistent earnings performance and volatile ROE raise concerns regarding future growth prospects.  The highly optimistic projected return should be viewed with extreme caution, requiring further investigation and validation.  Before making any investment decisions,  a deeper dive into the company's competitive landscape, future growth strategies, and macroeconomic factors is crucial.
