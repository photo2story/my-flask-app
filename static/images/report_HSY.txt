A comprehensive analysis of the company's competitive landscape, strategic initiatives, and macroeconomic factors would be necessary for a more informed investment decision.  The significant recent price increase warrants monitoring for potential corrections. Further investigation into the drivers of the variability in profit margins and ROE is crucial.
