**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

The provided data shows a negative divergence of -71.5%, placing it at the 2.3rd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided CAGR data also shows periods of strong performance, particularly 2019-2021, but also significant drawdowns, notably in 2022-2024. The consistently negative alpha suggests HSY has underperformed the market after adjusting for its beta (market risk).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $171.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $170.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $176.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $179.23

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.69 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.48 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)

The positive relative divergence suggests short-term upward pressure, but the overall trend, considering the moving averages, appears bearish. The exceptionally high expected return needs significant clarification. A 171.76 price, in context of the moving averages, does not suggest a sudden dramatic movement (neither a sharp rise nor a sudden fall).
