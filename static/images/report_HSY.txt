**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Hershey's cumulative return (66.85%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (120.73%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -53.9%, placing it in the 11th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance relative to the broader market.

Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of the upward trend.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HSY has underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent price action shows an upward trend, technical indicators suggest an overbought condition, raising concerns about a potential correction. Earnings results have been mixed, with no clear trend. Financial data reveals fluctuations in revenue, profit margins, and ROE. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits a more comprehensive assessment.  The current price seems slightly overvalued based on the moving averages and RSI, suggesting caution is warranted.  Further investigation into revenue growth trends (not fully discernible from the data provided) and detailed analyst reports are needed for a more robust investment decision.  The zero expected return highlights the need for careful consideration before investing.
