* **5-Day Moving Average:** $179.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $168.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $164.03

The stock price is currently above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The significant jump from the previous close ($180.01) indicates a recent price increase.

* **PPO:** 0.84 (Positive value suggests bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.7% (Short-term upward trend)

The high RSI value suggests the stock is currently overbought, implying a potential pullback.  However, the positive PPO and recent price increase suggest continued bullish momentum. The substantial price change from the previous close, a 2.81 increase, reflects a recent and potentially rapid price surge.  The projected long-term expected return of 67.4% relative to the S&P 500 is significantly high and should be interpreted cautiously.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

HSY's recent performance has been mixed. While the company shows healthy profit margins and consistent revenue, its stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in the long term and recently experienced a sharp price increase that is not entirely supported by earnings or technical indicators. The high RSI suggests potential for a correction. The high expected return should be viewed with skepticism.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of the recent price surge and assess the long-term investment potential, considering the risks involved.  A thorough analysis of macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions.
