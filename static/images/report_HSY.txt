Beta values fluctuate, demonstrating varying levels of market sensitivity over time.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) in 2022-2024 (-75%) warrants attention.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data reveals significant variability in quarterly performance.  While some quarters exceeded expectations (e.g., 2024-02-08, 2024-05-03, 2023-10-26), others fell short (e.g., 2024-11-07, 2024-08-01). There's no clear upward or downward trend in EPS.  More comprehensive data, including revenue figures, would provide a more complete picture.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates significantly quarter to quarter.  There's no consistent upward or downward trend that can be easily observed from the given data alone.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information about recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions, which was not provided in the original prompt.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HSY's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern.  While some quarters show strong EPS and profit margins, the inconsistent performance and relatively weak technical indicators raise questions.  The high maximum drawdown in 2022-2024 highlights the considerable risk associated with the stock.  More data (particularly on revenue trends and recent news) would allow for a more comprehensive assessment. The expected return of 0% suggests that, based on the provided data, long-term investment in HSY is unlikely to outperform the S&P 500.
