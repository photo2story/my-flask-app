## Hershey Co. (HSY) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Hershey Co. (HSY) is a leading confectionery company producing chocolate and other sweets.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 57.77% for HSY, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 120.91%. The difference is -63.1%, placing it at the 5.4th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (-71.7% to 86.7%).  This indicates HSY's underperformance relative to the broader market. The alpha consistently registers as 0.0, suggesting its performance has closely followed the market's beta.  However, note that the beta values fluctuate substantially across the provided time periods, suggesting potential volatility.  High beta (over 1) typically implies the stock is more volatile than the market, but here the reported Beta values are surprisingly low considering the large variance in CAGR.

* **Closing Price:** $183.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $184.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $177.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $181.34

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent slight downward trend.  However, it's above the 20-day moving average, indicating some potential short-term support.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.18 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.61 (Positive; suggesting upward momentum)
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** 5.4% (Positive, short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates no expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, based on current data.  Further, deeper analysis is needed. This projection is based only on the data provided and should not be considered a definitive forecast.)

Given the relatively neutral RSI and positive PPO, along with the positive relative strength, the current price of $183.10 doesn't suggest any significant immediate upward or downward pressure.  However, the data alone does not allow us to comment on potential future earnings surprises, which can heavily influence price movement.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**
