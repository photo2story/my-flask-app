**6. Overall Analysis:**

Hershey's recent performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500, showcasing considerable underperformance. While financial fundamentals, such as revenue and profit margins, appear reasonably strong, the company has struggled to meet earnings expectations consistently. Technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce, but the overall trend seems bearish.  The incredibly high projected return of 2001.4% requires further examination and validation as it is highly improbable. A more in-depth analysis would be required to determine the suitability of long-term investment in HSY, considering its current performance against the market and the potential risks involved.  Further investigation is needed to determine the drivers behind the earnings misses and to gain a clearer picture of the company's long-term prospects.
