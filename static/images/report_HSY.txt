Hershey Co. (HSY) is a leading confectionery company known for its iconic chocolate brands.  Over the period analyzed, HSY's cumulative return (28.26%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (119.94%). The difference is -91.7%, placing it at the 1.3 percentile of the historical relative performance range (-94.0% to 86.6%).  This indicates HSY's substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last recorded market close, HSY's price was $149.23.  The stock price shows a downward trend:

* **5-day moving average:** $150.66
* **20-day moving average:** $157.89
* **60-day moving average:** $169.96

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting bearish momentum. The recent decrease of -$0.33 from the previous close (-0.22%) indicates a minor negative price movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The technical indicators paint a picture of a weak market position for HSY:

* **RSI (22.75):**  Significantly below 30, indicating the stock is in oversold territory. This suggests potential for a rebound, but it doesn't guarantee it.
* **PPO (-0.18):** Negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+1.3):** Shows a recent short-term upward movement, though this is in the context of a longer-term downtrend.
* **Expected Return (2010.6%):**  This extremely high figure needs clarification. It likely represents a projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500,  assuming significant future outperformance which is not supported by recent performance or current technical indicators.  Further explanation of the calculation methodology is required.
