**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR & MDD:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows highly variable performance across different 3-year periods, with significant growth in some periods but recent substantial declines. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the investment's performance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500). The recent negative Alpha values, particularly -66.0% and -87.0%, indicate substantial underperformance compared to the benchmark.  Conversely, periods like 2020-2022 showed strong positive Alpha (45.0%), suggesting outperformance during that time.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the investment's volatility relative to the market. The Beta values are generally low (around 0.1 to 0.5), indicating that HSY's price is less sensitive to market movements than the S&P 500. A beta near zero suggests that HSY's returns are almost independent of market returns, which may make it attractive for risk mitigation.
*   **Cap:**  The market capitalization has fluctuated over the periods.

*   **RSI:** 57.32
*   **PPO:** 0.6567
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_3%_Buy 80% of cash (111 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34) (Cash Ratio: 3% on 2025-07-22)
*   **Recent (20-Day) Relative Spread Change:** 1.2% (Positive - Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 544.8% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The low MRI (0.3359) suggests relatively low market risk for HSY at the moment.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 57.32 indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, residing in neutral territory.
*   **PPO:**  The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) at 0.6567 is positive, suggesting that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which can be interpreted as a bullish signal.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "cash_3%_Buy" signal suggests a buying opportunity, but the "Caution" flag due to the MRI indicates some level of risk awareness is advised.
*   **Spread Change:** The positive change in the relative spread indicates that HSY has begun to recover some ground relative to the S&P 500 recently.
*   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return (544.8%) should be interpreted with extreme caution. This is a model-driven projection, and such high returns are unlikely to be realized in practice. It suggests the model sees significant long-term potential relative to the S&P 500, but this projection requires further scrutiny and validation.
*   **Price Change Reflection:** The significant price change (2.79%) is reflected in the RSI and PPO values, indicating a shift towards bullish momentum.

The high expected return should be viewed cautiously, as it is a model-driven projection and may not be realistic. The MRI indicates low market risk, and the hybrid signal suggests a possible buying opportunity. It's crucial for investors to weigh these factors carefully and conduct further research before making investment decisions.
