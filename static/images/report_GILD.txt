**4.  Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue    |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2024-08-08 | 1.29  | 6.95 B$    |

The most recent earnings report (2024-08-08) showed an EPS of 1.29 and revenue of $6.95 billion. While the EPS was positive, it missed analysts' expectations, which could explain the recent negative relative divergence.  

**5.  Overall Analysis:**

GILD's recent performance has been lackluster, lagging behind the broader market. The stock is currently overbought, suggesting potential for a short-term pullback. However, positive momentum, a strong long-term trend, and a promising 5-year expected return suggest potential for future growth. However, it is crucial to monitor the company's financial performance, particularly in the context of analyst expectations, to assess future growth potential.

**Conclusion:**

GILD is a company with a long history of success, but its current performance is a cause for concern. The stock is currently overbought and facing a potential pullback.  Investors should monitor the stock closely, particularly its earnings performance, and consider its relative performance against the S&P 500 before making any investment decisions.
