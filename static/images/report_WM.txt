**6. Overall Analysis:**

WM exhibits strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Financial indicators like profit margins and ROE suggest a healthy and stable company.  However, recent price action shows a slight dip, and technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term correction.  The inconsistent EPS data requires further investigation.  The projected 29.8% expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant positive.  Further due diligence is needed to verify the accuracy of the provided data, especially the duplicated earnings data point.  Despite the slight short-term concerns, the long-term outlook for WM appears positive based on its historical performance and current financial health.
