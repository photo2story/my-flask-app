This section requires additional information.  The prompt doesn't provide any news or recent market outlook data or analyst opinions.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting a strong cumulative return. However, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  Technical indicators, specifically the extremely low RSI, point towards potential for a rebound, but the negative PPO and downward price movement suggest caution.  Financials appear healthy, with consistent revenue growth and stable profit margins.  The expected return is high, but highly dependent on future performance mirroring historical data and involves inherent risk.  More current market information, analyst ratings, and a clearer earnings picture are necessary for a complete assessment. The inconsistencies in the earnings data and lack of recent news require further investigation to draw more reliable conclusions.
