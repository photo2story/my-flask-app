Waste Management's cumulative return (140.93%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (114.28%).  The difference is 26.6%, placing it at the 45.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  This suggests consistent outperformance, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (1.67):** Extremely low, suggesting the stock is oversold.  However, this RSI value seems unusually low and may warrant further investigation into the calculation method.  A value this low is unusual and could be a data error.
* **PPO (-0.98):** Negative, indicating bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Strength Change (-4.8%):** Shows a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (91.8%):** This high expected return, relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) timeframe, reflects the significant historical outperformance.  This needs to be considered within the context of the risk associated with the investment.  The exceptionally high expected return needs further clarification about the methodology.

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entries for Dec 6th, 2024), making a comprehensive analysis challenging.  However, based on the available, non-duplicate data:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates around $160 Billion, with slight increases throughout the year.  A complete picture requires consistent data.

A complete and reliable analysis requires clarification and correction of the inconsistencies in the data.
