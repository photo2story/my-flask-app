**6. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management Inc. exhibits strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, indicated by a significantly higher cumulative return and a consistently positive alpha in most years.  While recent technical indicators suggest a slight short-term bearish trend, the long-term outlook appears positive, supported by a projected 20.9% return above the S&P 500.  The company demonstrates consistent revenue growth and healthy profit margins.  However, inconsistencies in EPS data and ROE fluctuations warrant further investigation.  The relatively high beta in some years suggests higher volatility than the market average, requiring consideration of risk tolerance.  Addressing the data discrepancies and conducting a more in-depth fundamental analysis would provide a more comprehensive assessment.
