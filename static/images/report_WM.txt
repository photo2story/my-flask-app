* **Revenue:** Revenue generally fluctuates between approximately $159B and $168B. There's no clear upward or downward trend.
* **EPS:** EPS shows significant variation between quarters, ranging from $0.06 to $0.63. This variability makes it difficult to establish a clear trend.  Further information is needed for more insightful analysis.
