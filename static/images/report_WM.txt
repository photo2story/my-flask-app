**6. Overall Analysis:**

WM exhibits strong historical performance, consistently outperforming the S&P 500.  Positive alpha, consistent revenue growth, and a relatively stable profit margin suggest a healthy and profitable business.  However, the higher Beta indicates higher volatility than the market.  While recent price movements show a short-term upward trend, the provided data is limited, requiring further analysis for a complete picture. The duplicate earnings data needs clarification. A deeper dive into the reasons for EPS and ROE fluctuations is recommended.  The long-term expected return of 22.1% over the S&P 500 is promising but dependent on maintaining this performance level.  Investors should consider the higher volatility and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.
