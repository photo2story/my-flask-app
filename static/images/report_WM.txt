**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM shows strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction (overbought RSI), the positive PPO and strong financial fundamentals suggest a bullish long-term outlook.  However, the duplicate earnings data entry requires clarification.  Further investigation into the Q4 2023 ROE dip is also recommended.  The high beta suggests higher volatility than the market, which should be considered.  The high expected return (56.8%) relative to the S&P 500 over the long term warrants consideration for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance.
