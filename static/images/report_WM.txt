**6. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management Inc. (WM) has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend, the strong long-term growth, positive recent price movement, and consistent financial performance suggest a positive long-term outlook.  The high MRI warrants caution, but the expected 22% long-term return above the S&P 500 makes it an attractive investment for long-term investors with a tolerance for higher market risk.  However, it's crucial to monitor earnings reports and market conditions closely.  More complete and consistent data would allow for a more in-depth analysis.
