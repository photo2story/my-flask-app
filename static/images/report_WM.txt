## Waste Management Inc. (WM) Investment Review

This report analyzes Waste Management Inc. (WM), a leading provider of waste management services in North America, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Waste Management's cumulative return (149.92%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.91%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 29.0%, placing it in the 48.9th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (max: 70.5%, min: -10.7%).  This suggests consistent outperformance, though not always at the extreme high end of its historical performance. The provided CAGR data further supports this strong historical performance, averaging between 39% and 73% across the analyzed periods.  However, it's crucial to note that past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $213.20
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $215.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $220.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.87

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (22.61):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound.
* **PPO (-0.77):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-11.4%):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (86.4%):**  This represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This high projection should be viewed cautiously, given the inherent uncertainty in long-term projections.  Further analysis of the methodology used to calculate this expected return would be beneficial. The current price of $213.20 is not significantly higher or lower than the moving averages, indicating no sudden major price movements recently.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some variability. While revenue has generally increased, EPS has fluctuated.  There's no information on expectations to compare against, therefore, it's impossible to assess whether earnings "beat" or "missed" expectations.

* **Revenue:** Shows relatively consistent growth, although there was a slight dip in Q4 2023, followed by an increase in subsequent quarters.
* **EPS:** Shows significant fluctuation quarter-to-quarter; this warrants further investigation into potential underlying factors.  The data provided is incomplete, making a complete analysis difficult. Note the discrepancy in the December 2024 entries.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable and strong, with a consistent profit margin hovering around 39%.  This indicates robust profitability and operational efficiency.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown steady growth, and ROE has fluctuated but generally remained above 9%, indicating reasonable return on invested capital.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news or market outlook information was provided.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing.  This lack of information hinders a comprehensive assessment of the current market sentiment surrounding WM.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management has historically outperformed the S&P 500. While recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, oversold RSI levels hint at potential for a bounce.  Consistent revenue and relatively high profit margins showcase financial strength.  However, the fluctuating EPS and lack of recent news, analyst opinions, and a complete earnings dataset make a conclusive assessment difficult. The extremely high projected long-term return needs further scrutiny.  Further investigation into the reasons for EPS volatility and accessing complete earnings data, including comparisons to expectations, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
