**Conclusion:**

WM appears to be a fundamentally sound company with good growth prospects.  However, recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and some concerning news articles suggest caution.  Investors should carefully weigh the high expected return against the potential risks, especially given the mixed signals from news articles and the recent relative divergence change.  The high and consistent MDD is a concern, particularly for risk-averse investors. Further research is recommended to understand the assumptions behind the high expected return and to evaluate the company's long-term growth strategy in light of the challenges in the waste management industry.
