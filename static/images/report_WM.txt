### 7. Overall Assessment

Based on the provided data, Waste Management Inc. appears to be a fundamentally sound company with strong long-term growth potential. It has historically outperformed the S&P 500, maintains healthy financials, and operates in a relatively low-risk environment. However, recent price action suggests some short-term downward pressure, and investors should pay close attention to recent news and events that could influence the stock's volatility. The RSI approaching oversold levels *could* present a buying opportunity, but this should be confirmed with additional analysis and consideration of your individual risk tolerance. The expected return is very high, but this must be tempered against the inherent risk and volatility in the market. Investors should monitor for any news, executive actions, industry trends or change to regulations that could impact the long-term outlook.
