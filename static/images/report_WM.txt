* **Closing Price:** $202.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $204.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $212.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.80

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (10.33):**  Extremely oversold, indicating potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.54):** Negative, confirming the downtrend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-4.1%):** Shows a recent weakening of the relative strength of WM compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (59.8%):** This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This high expected return should be treated with caution, as it's a projection and not a guaranteed outcome. The current price of $202.27 being below the moving averages suggests a potential for a price rebound. While it's not a dramatic fall warranting "crash" terminology, the current market position requires monitoring for price rebound or continued bearish trends.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM shows strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, supported by technical indicators.  The extremely oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the negative PPO and downward moving averages point to a bearish trend for the near future.  Financial statements reveal consistent revenue growth and strong profitability.  Further analysis of recent news, analyst opinions, and clarification of conflicting earnings data is required to obtain a comprehensive view. The high projected long-term return should be viewed with appropriate caution.  It's important to consider the high beta when evaluating the potential risk.
