## Waste Management Inc. (WM) Stock Review

This report analyzes Waste Management Inc. (WM), a leading provider of waste management services in North America, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Waste Management's cumulative return (140.81%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's return (114.36%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 26.4 percentage points, placing it at the 45.7th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500. This indicates strong relative performance, though past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $205.43
* **5-day moving average:** $210.74
* **20-day moving average:** $219.48
* **60-day moving average:** $215.03

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 1.22 – Extremely low, indicating the stock is oversold.  This could signal a potential bounce, but it’s crucial to consider other factors.
* **PPO:** -0.96 – Negative, suggesting bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -3.7% – A recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 92.3% over the long term (2+ years) with a consistent investment strategy.  This is a high projected outperformance.  Consider this projection with caution, as it is based on historical data and future performance is uncertain.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicates.  We will analyze the unique data points:

* **Revenue:** Shows some fluctuation but generally increasing trend, though not consistently. The increase from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024 is notable, indicating strong revenue.
* **EPS:** Fluctuates significantly, most notably a sharp drop from Q1 2024 to Q4 2023.  Q3 2024 shows a recovery from Q2 2024.  Without further context and expectations, determining "beats" or "misses" is impossible. The duplicate data point for December 6th, 2024, is confusing and hinders accurate analysis.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows consistent growth, with profit margins remaining relatively stable around 39%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is increasing steadily. Return on Equity (ROE) shows some fluctuation but generally remains healthy, above 9% for most quarters.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions were provided.  Market outlook information is also absent.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management exhibits strong historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, evidenced by the significantly higher cumulative return. However, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend. Technical indicators (RSI, PPO) point towards an oversold condition and negative momentum, while the projection of significant long-term outperformance is very optimistic and needs to be viewed critically. Earnings data shows inconsistencies which need clarification; however, there is observable fluctuation in EPS and a generally positive revenue trend.  Financial health appears solid, with consistent revenue growth and a healthy ROE.  The lack of recent news prevents a complete assessment of current market sentiment and potential catalysts.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and recent news is crucial for a more comprehensive evaluation.

**8. Conclusion:**

While WM demonstrates historical strength relative to the market and healthy financials, current indicators suggest short-term caution. The projected long-term outperformance needs validation with additional data and context. The conflicting and incomplete earnings data must be clarified before a final conclusion on the company's financial performance can be reached.  Investors should conduct thorough due diligence, including reviewing more complete recent financial statements and market analyses, before making any investment decisions.
