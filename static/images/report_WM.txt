## Waste Management Inc. (WM) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Waste Management Inc. (WM) is a leading provider of waste management services in North America.  Over the past period, WM has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a considerably higher cumulative return. While recent price action suggests some short-term weakness, the company's financials demonstrate robust profitability and growth potential.  Further analysis is needed to determine if the current valuation accurately reflects its long-term prospects.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

WM's cumulative return of 152.83% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's 82.57% return over the analyzed period.  The difference of 70.3 percentage points places it at the 73.5th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500 (based on the provided range of -10.5% to 99.5%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals consistently positive alpha values (ranging from 0.0 to 0.3), suggesting WM has generated returns above what would be expected based solely on its beta (market risk exposure). Beta values fluctuate between 30.6 and 80.9, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements over time.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows strong performance in most periods, with a notable jump to 99% between 2019-2021.  However, maximum drawdown (MDD) also experienced some significant peaks, indicating periods of substantial risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $227.47
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $228.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $228.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $226.83

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent closing price of $227.47 represents a slight decrease of -$0.51 from the previous close. This is a relatively small decrease and does not signal a significant 급하락 (sharp drop) yet.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.35 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.0492 (Slightly negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -8.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 28.4% (Long-term excess return over the S&P 500)

The RSI approaching oversold levels, the negative PPO, and the recent negative relative divergence indicate potential short-term downside risk. However, the positive expected return suggests a potentially favorable long-term outlook relative to the S&P 500.
