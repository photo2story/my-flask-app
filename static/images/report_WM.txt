**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Waste Management, Inc. is a leading provider of comprehensive waste management environmental services in North America.  The company significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the historical period considered, with a cumulative return of 155.47% compared to VOO's 76.08%.  The 79.4% difference highlights a substantial outperformance.  The relative divergence of 81.7% confirms this strong historical outperformance, placing WM's performance in the upper percentiles relative to VOO's performance within the given historical data.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha values (ranging from 0.0 to 0.3), suggesting that WM generated returns exceeding what would be expected based solely on its beta (market risk).  The beta values fluctuate around 30-70, indicating higher than average market sensitivity. However, the positive alpha demonstrates excess return generation.  CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)  fluctuates, reflecting market cycles, yet generally shows respectable growth. Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) indicate potential risk levels.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor recent downward trend. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend in the medium to long term.  The recent negative change (-$0.83) is relatively small.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 50.56 is near neutral territory, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.  The PPO of 0.08 suggests a slightly positive momentum. The recent increase in relative divergence (+2.6) further supports a short-term upward trend. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.41 suggests a medium risk level.  The expected return of 22.6% over the long term (2+ years) versus the S&P 500 is significant and positive.  The price decrease of -$0.83 is not drastic and does not indicate a significant, sudden market shift.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent, with duplicate entries for December 2024.  Assuming the second December 2024 entry is an error, we observe some fluctuation in EPS and revenue.  A more comprehensive analysis would require consistent and complete data.

| 날짜       | EPS | 매출       |
|------------|-----|------------|
| 2024-12-06 | 0.57 | 168.00 B$  |

**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability show relatively consistent performance across the quarters. Profit margins are consistently high (around 39%). ROE (Return on Equity) also shows fluctuation but generally indicates positive returns on shareholders' equity.  More detailed analysis would involve trend analysis and ratio comparisons against industry benchmarks.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

WM demonstrates a strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Positive alpha and relatively high and consistent profit margins highlight strong profitability.  However, relatively high beta values suggest sensitivity to market fluctuations.  While recent price movement shows minor downward pressure, indicators like moving averages suggest a potential upward trend.  The long-term expected return is promising. Further analysis with complete and consistent data (especially earnings) is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.  The current medium risk level (MRI) should be considered in investment decisions.
