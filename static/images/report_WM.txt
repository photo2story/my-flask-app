**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  While revenue remains relatively consistent and high, EPS fluctuates.  Further investigation into the reasons for the EPS variations is needed for a complete understanding.

|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-12-06 | 0.57 | 168.00        |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

WM shows strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, evidenced by a consistently positive alpha and healthy financial metrics.  However, recent price action and earnings volatility warrant closer scrutiny.  The relatively high relative outperformance compared to historical data raises a concern about potential overvaluation.  While long-term prospects appear promising, given the 14.8% expected return, investors should carefully monitor earnings reports, technical indicators, and broader market trends before making investment decisions.  The inconsistencies in some data points need further clarification.  Further due diligence, including assessing the competitive landscape and future growth opportunities, is crucial for a complete evaluation.
