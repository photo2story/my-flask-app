Waste Management Inc. (WM) is a leading waste management company providing comprehensive waste collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling services.

Over the reviewed period, WM's cumulative return (146.17%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (116.43%).  The difference is 29.7%, placing it at the 49.8th percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500 based on the provided data (max: 70.4%, min: -10.7%). This suggests that WM's performance has generally been above the S&P 500, but not consistently at the extreme high end of its historical range.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent positive alpha (0.1) across the analyzed periods, indicating that WM has outperformed the market benchmark (after accounting for market risk). The high beta (85.0) suggests WM's returns are highly sensitive to market movements. This is common for cyclical stocks.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates, highlighting the volatility inherent in the waste management sector and its sensitivity to economic conditions. MDD (Maximum Drawdown) shows periods of significant loss, reinforcing the risk associated with its high beta.  Capitalization (Cap) remains consistently at 85B.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $211.00
* **5-day Moving Average:** $208.19
* **20-day Moving Average:** $205.147
* **60-day Moving Average:** $213.8142

The price is currently above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential slight correction or consolidation phase could be in progress.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 67.54 –  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.596 –  Positive, indicating upward momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** +5.2 –  Positive divergence reflects short-term price strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 40.3% –  This is a significant outperformance expectation compared to the S&P 500, implying strong potential, although this should be considered within the context of the inherent risks.

The current price of $211.00 is not exceptionally high given the recent trends and is not suggestive of an imminent major correction; however, the RSI and proximity to the 60-day moving average signal caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and has duplicate entries for December 2024.  A consistent and accurate dataset is needed for a proper analysis.  The available information shows some variability in EPS and revenue, but lacks sufficient data to draw firm conclusions about recent performance trends.


**5. Financial Information (Revenue and Profitability):**

Revenue has remained relatively stable, fluctuating within a narrow range around $5.2B to $5.6B over the past five quarters.  Profit margins are consistently high (around 39%), demonstrating profitability and efficiency.


**Capital and Profitability:**

Equity shows steady growth, indicating financial health.  ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates but generally remains above 9%, suggesting effective utilization of shareholder capital, although there was a dip to 7.14% at the end of 2023.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM exhibits strong long-term growth potential as evidenced by its consistent outperformance of the S&P 500 and positive alpha. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the high beta, indicating substantial market risk.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term consolidation after a period of upward momentum, but overall trend remains positive.  The high profit margins and generally stable revenue and equity demonstrate financial strength.  Further analysis with complete and consistent earnings data would enhance the insights.  The projected high expected return should be considered alongside the high beta and potential for short-term corrections indicated by the RSI and price movement relative to moving averages.
