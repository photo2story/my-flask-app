**6. Overall Analysis:**

WM has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Financial statements reveal consistent profitability and healthy revenue growth. However, the high RSI suggests potential overvaluation in the short term, and some caution is warranted.  The relatively low beta suggests lower sensitivity to market fluctuations.  While the long-term expected return is positive, investors should monitor the technical indicators closely and consider the inherent risks before making investment decisions.  Further investigation is needed to resolve the duplicate data entry in the recent earnings report.  A comprehensive risk assessment should also be conducted before any investment decision.
