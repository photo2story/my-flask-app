    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is significant, indicating periods of substantial price decline.
    *   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the stock's performance compared to its benchmark. The negative Alpha in 2018-2020 and 2023-2025 suggests underperformance relative to the benchmark during those periods. The high alpha in 2021-2023 is an outlier compared to other periods.
    *   **Beta:** Beta indicates the stock's volatility relative to the market. The consistently low Beta values (0.0 to 0.3) suggest WM has been less volatile than the overall market.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization, showing consistent increase, which indicates company growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   Current Close: 216.15
*   Last-market: {'price': 214.06, 'previousClose': 213.365, 'change': 0.33}
*   5-day SMA: 216.43
*   20-day SMA: 210.09
*   60-day SMA: 213.06

    *   Analysis: The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA but above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. The 20-day SMA is notably lower than the 60-day SMA, suggesting a recent upward trend in price. The slight change in the Last-market indicates minimal price fluctuation.

*   RSI: 70.06 (Approaching Overbought)
*   PPO: 0.46

*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -8.4 (Short-term decline)
*   Expected Return: 187.2% (Long-term)

    *   Analysis: The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI approaching 70 indicates that the stock is nearing overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback may be coming. The negative change in relative divergence indicates recent underperformance in the short term. The unusually high Expected Return (%) of 187.2% should be carefully evaluated and viewed with skepticism.

    *   Some sources mention potential for the stock price to go up.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜        | EPS  | 매출      |
|-------------|------|----------|
| 2025-12-03 | 0.77 | 177.77 B$ |

| 2025-12-03 | 0.57 | 168.00 B$ |

    *   Analysis:  The table includes duplicate data points with different dates. In this case, I'm assuming the table means to have two different EPS values for the same date. It's important to ensure the accuracy of the information and double check that it doesn't represent different projections. The EPS has fluctuated, with the highest being 0.88. Revenue has generally increased, with the latest figure at $177.77 Billion. Note that this is likely not true revenue figures (given the company size), and a typo.
