**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

**Summary:**

Waste Management (WM) has underperformed the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative return over the specified period. However, recent indicators present a mixed picture. While there has been a short-term decline in relative performance, analyst sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, with upgrades and high target prices suggesting significant upside potential. The company exhibits consistent revenue growth and high profit margins. Financial health indicators are positive, and the overall market risk is considered medium.

**Conclusion:**

While WM has faced some challenges in recent periods, the overall outlook is positive. Analyst upgrades, strong revenue growth, and high profit margins suggest that WM could be a promising investment opportunity. The recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 could be an opportunity for investors to enter at a potentially undervalued price, especially given the high long-term expected return. However, potential investors should carefully consider the recent short-term decline in relative performance, especially the increased MDD and the reduced Alpha in the 2023-2025 period.
