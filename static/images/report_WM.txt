**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Waste Management Inc. (WM) demonstrates strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While some technical indicators suggest caution (high MRI, slightly negative PPO), the strong financial fundamentals (high and stable profit margins, growing revenue and equity, strong ROE) and the consistently positive alpha suggest a positive long-term outlook.  The high relative divergence underscores the strength of its outperformance relative to the market. However, investors should carefully consider the high market risk indicated by the MRI and monitor the company's earnings and financial performance for any significant changes. The projected long-term expected return is attractive, but future performance is not guaranteed and depends on various market factors.  Further due diligence, including a deeper analysis of the duplicate data point and a review of the company's future plans, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
