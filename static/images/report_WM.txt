**0) Executive Summary:**

Waste Management Inc. (WM) is a leading North American waste management company.  Based on the provided data, WM exhibits strong performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), demonstrating consistent revenue and profitability growth.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term pullback.  Long-term prospects appear positive, supported by a high expected return exceeding the S&P 500.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has steadily increased.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $220.26

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $215.90
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $209.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.14

The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, it's above the 20-day moving average, which is a more significant indicator.  The recent price drop is relatively modest.
