The price is above all three moving averages, indicating a bullish trend in the short to medium term.  The last market price of $225.56 is close to the closing price and below the 5-day moving average, which is a short-term decline but still above the longer term averages.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.46 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.21 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence:**  NaN (-), indicating a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 67% over the long term (2+ years), exceeding the S&P 500's expected return. This is a stated expected return and should not be interpreted as a guaranteed outcome.

The RSI and PPO suggest a generally positive outlook, but the negative relative divergence warrants monitoring. The high expected return (67%) compared to the S&P 500 is a significant highlight, suggesting strong potential for future outperformance.  However, this is a forecast and not a certainty.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in EPS.  Revenue shows relatively consistent levels and only slight increase over time. There's no clear trend in revenue growth. EPS varies widely across quarters, with 2023-09-01 showing a high EPS of 2.93, significantly higher than other reported quarters. Direct comparison with expectations is not possible due to the absence of that data.  More data is required for a comprehensive analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management Inc. shows strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent price action is bullish, supported by positive moving averages.  Technical indicators suggest a moderately positive outlook, though short term momentum might be declining.

Longer term future performance is subject to market conditions and unforeseen events.  A more in-depth analysis is needed for conclusive recommendations, requiring additional data about expectations and recent news.  The substantial outperformance in the past, assuming this is representative of the future,  supports the claimed high expected return; however, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.
