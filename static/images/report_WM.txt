## Waste Management Inc. (WM) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

WM, Waste Management Inc., is a leading waste management company in North America.  The provided data shows strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO).  However, recent price movements suggest potential short-term volatility.  Further analysis is needed to determine the long-term outlook.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

WM's cumulative return (154.09%) substantially exceeds the S&P 500's cumulative return (78.93%) over the analyzed period. The raw difference is 75.16%, and its relative divergence of 77.9% places it in the upper percentile of historical performance compared to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals consistent positive alpha (0.0 to 0.3), indicating outperformance relative to the market benchmark, with a beta consistently above 1 (30.6 to 80.9), demonstrating higher volatility than the market.  CAGR is quite variable (37% to 99%), suggesting uneven growth across the periods, while MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values show significant periodic market declines.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects overall company growth.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $228.63
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $229.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $228.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $226.59

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating potential short-term bearish pressure.  However, it is above the 60-day moving average, suggesting longer-term support.  The recent closing price shows a slight decrease (-0.58) compared to the previous close, which isn't a significant drop on its own.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.02 (Slightly below neutral; suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.0085 (Positive, but very close to zero; indicating weak momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 25.1% (Long-term, exceeding S&P 500)

The relatively low RSI and slightly negative 20-day relative divergence change suggest a possibility of continued near-term downward pressure. The positive PPO, though weak, indicates some upward momentum. The relatively low MRI suggests manageable risk. The significant projected long-term excess return over the S&P 500 is a key positive.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-12-06 | 0.57 | 168.00       |
| 2024-08-30 | 0.56 | 167.77       |
| 2024-06-07 | 0.63 | 159.94       |
| 2023-11-30 | 0.17 | 159.44       |
| 2024-12-06 | 0.06 | 159.44       |

There appears to be a data duplication issue (two entries for 2024-12-06). Assuming the lower EPS is an error, revenue shows consistent growth, while EPS fluctuates.  A more thorough analysis of the earnings data, including comparison to previous years and industry trends, would be necessary for complete evaluation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

WM demonstrates a strong historical track record of outperforming the S&P 500, with consistent positive alpha and significant long-term projected returns.  However, recent price movements and some technical indicators suggest potential short-term downside risk.  The company displays solid financial health, with consistently high revenue growth and profit margins.  More detailed analysis of earnings data and a broader macroeconomic assessment are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The considerable long-term growth potential, however, remains a compelling factor.  Considering the volatility indicated by the Beta,  a well-diversified portfolio approach is recommended.
