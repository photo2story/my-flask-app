**6) Overall Analysis:**

WM exhibits strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, showcasing consistent outperformance.  Current price is above key moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. However, the high RSI value indicates an overbought condition, raising concerns about potential short-term corrections.  The positive PPO and strong financial metrics (revenue, profit margin) suggest a healthy company.  The projected 19% long-term excess return against the S&P 500 is compelling, but potential short-term volatility should be considered.  Further analysis should focus on identifying the drivers behind EPS fluctuations and ROE changes, as well as assessing the sustainability of the high relative divergence.  The accuracy of the provided earnings data should also be verified.
