*   **Recommendation:**  A cautious approach is warranted.
    *   **Existing Holders:** Consider holding, but closely monitor the stock's performance and news flow.  Be prepared to reduce your position if the negative trends persist.
    *   **Potential Investors:**  Wait for a clearer indication of a turnaround before initiating a new position.  Watch for a break above the moving averages and a stabilization of the RSI.
*   **Key Factors to Watch:**
    *   Resolution of conflicting earnings data.
    *   Upcoming earnings reports and company announcements.
    *   News related to business developments, regulatory changes, and market events.
