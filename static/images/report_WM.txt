**6. Overall Analysis:**

WM exhibits a strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent price action shows positive momentum, and technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish outlook.  Financial statements reveal steady revenue growth and healthy profit margins. However, inconsistent earnings data limits a more thorough assessment of recent performance.  The high beta suggests higher volatility than the overall market.  The expected long-term outperformance of the S&P 500 is significant but should be considered alongside the inherent risk associated with the stock's volatility.  Further investigation into the inconsistent earnings data is crucial for a complete analysis.
