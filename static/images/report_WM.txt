The final cumulative return difference is 29.0%, indicating a substantial outperformance.  While the relative divergence of 49.0% suggests a strong outperformance compared to historical volatility between the two, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

* **60-day Moving Average:** $213.90

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term pullback from a recent high.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Expected Return:** 41.4% – This represents a significant projected outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), assuming continued positive trends.  However, it's crucial to understand that this is a projection and not a guarantee.  The high expected return should be considered in light of potential risks.  A price of $207.17 doesn't necessitate a significant adjustment to this projection, as it falls within a reasonable range given recent performance.
