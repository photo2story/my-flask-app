This report analyzes Waste Management Inc. (WM), a leading waste management company providing services including collection, transfer, disposal, and recycling.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Waste Management's cumulative return of 186.7% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return of 128.86%.  The difference is 57.8%, placing it at the 76.8th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests strong relative outperformance.  The provided Alpha values consistently above 1 further support this, indicating superior risk-adjusted returns compared to the benchmark.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $228.46 (Last Market: $228.49)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $225.50
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $221.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $212.88

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (65.96):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.2):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+10.4):** Shows recent strong upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (65.5%):**  A projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance of the S&P 500. This figure seems exceptionally high and should be treated with caution; further investigation into the methodology used to derive this estimate is needed. The closing price of $228.49 is not significantly different from the closing price of $228.46, so no significant rapid price movements are observed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS and revenue data are inconsistent and contain duplicates.  A clear analysis requires consistent and complete data. The provided table needs correction to accurately assess quarterly results comparison, revenue growth trends, and EPS trends. The inconsistent data prevents a meaningful analysis of beats or misses versus expectations.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable around $5.4B - $5.6B over the last four quarters. Profit margins are consistently high, hovering around 39%, indicating strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown steady growth, and Return on Equity (ROE) has fluctuated, reaching highs above 10%. While this indicates profitability, it's essential to analyze the fluctuation in ROE to understand the underlying drivers.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to provide a complete analysis.  Without this information, a comprehensive assessment of current sentiment and future prospects cannot be made.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management shows strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent price action suggests an upward trend, supported by positive momentum indicators. However, caution is warranted due to the RSI approaching overbought levels.  The provided earnings data is inconsistent and requires correction for a proper analysis. The extraordinarily high projected long-term return requires further scrutiny.  A more complete picture requires access to missing financial data, recent news, and analyst sentiment.


**8.  Recommendations:**

Based on the available (though incomplete) data, WM exhibits several positive characteristics, particularly its historical outperformance. However, several key areas require further investigation before forming a definitive investment opinion.  These include:


* **Data Verification:**  Reconciling the inconsistencies in the earnings data is critical for a reliable assessment of financial health.
* **News and Analyst Sentiment:**  Accessing current market opinions and analyst ratings will provide valuable context for investment decisions.
* **Expected Return Validation:** The exceptionally high projected return requires a thorough understanding of the underlying assumptions and methodology.
* **Risk Assessment:**  A comprehensive analysis should include a detailed assessment of the company's risk profile.

Until these gaps are addressed, a comprehensive investment recommendation cannot be made.  Further due diligence is strongly advised.
