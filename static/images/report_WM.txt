**7. 종합 Analysis (Summary)**

Overall, Waste Management Inc. has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent data indicates a potential shift in momentum. While revenue and equity are growing and profit margins are robust, recent stock price declines, negative alpha, and a decreasing ROE require careful consideration.

**Key Points:**

*   **Positive:** Solid revenue growth, stable profit margins, increasing equity, long-term outperformance potential.
*   **Negative:** Recent stock price weakness, decreasing ROE, negative alpha in the most recent period, high maximum drawdown, and a hybrid signal suggesting caution.

**Recommendation:** The data suggests a mixed outlook. WM's strong fundamentals and historical outperformance are attractive. However, the recent slowdown in growth, declining profitability metrics (alpha, ROE), and negative short-term momentum warrant caution. Potential investors should closely monitor the company's upcoming earnings reports and news releases to assess whether the recent negative trends are temporary or indicative of a more significant change in the company's prospects. A cautious approach, as suggested by the hybrid signal, may be prudent at this time.
