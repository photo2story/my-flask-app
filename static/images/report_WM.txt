## Waste Management Inc. (WM) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Waste Management Inc. (WM) is a leading provider of waste management services in North America.  Over the analyzed period, WM's cumulative return (159.5%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (121.1%). The difference is 38.4 percentage points.  This places WM's performance at the 60.5th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500, indicating strong relative performance but not necessarily indicating future outperformance.  The provided alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting consistent outperformance relative to the market (beta), though the magnitude is relatively small. The beta values indicate  WM's sensitivity to market movements.  It's important to note that past performance doesn't guarantee future results.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $222.43
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $213.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $208.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.03

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The price shows a recent jump, reflected in the substantial daily change ($6.15 increase), which warrants monitoring for potential volatility and pullbacks.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 74.94 –  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction.
* **PPO:** 0.67 – Positive value indicates an upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence:** +19.8% – This confirms the short-term uptrend.

The large price change suggests a recent period of rapid price increase (potential for a short-term correction as per RSI).  The expected return of 28.3% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 represents a significant potential outperformance, but this is only an estimation and subject to market conditions and company performance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and includes duplicate entries (2024-12-06 appears twice).  A clear picture of earnings trends cannot be formed from this data without clarifying the discrepancies and providing consistent data points.  Further analysis requires accurate and complete financial statements.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-12-06 | 0.57 | 168.00       |
| 2024-08-30 | 0.56 | 167.77       |

**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability, and Capital and Profitability tables show consistent revenue and healthy profit margins (around 39%). However, the Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates, suggesting variability in the efficiency of using shareholder equity to generate profits.  Further analysis would be needed to understand the reasons behind these ROE fluctuations.



**7. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management (WM) shows strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. Recent price action suggests a short-term uptrend, though the RSI indicates potential for a near-term correction.  The expected long-term outperformance is promising, but significant risk remains given the inherent volatility of the market and potential economic downturns.  Inconsistent earnings data requires clarification before a complete assessment can be done.  While the financial information shows a generally healthy financial picture, the fluctuating ROE warrants further investigation.  A more thorough analysis, including a review of WM's competitive landscape, future growth prospects, and a sensitivity analysis of the expected return against various market scenarios, is necessary for a complete investment decision.
