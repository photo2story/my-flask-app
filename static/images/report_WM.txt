This report analyzes Waste Management Inc. (WM), a leading provider of waste management services in North America, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Waste Management's cumulative return (148.09%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (121.78%).  The difference is 26.3%, placing it in the 45.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range. This suggests strong relative performance, though not consistently exceeding the S&P 500 over all periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $211.64
* **Last Market Price:** $210.16
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $213.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $220.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $215.01

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a possible short-term downtrend.  The difference between the closing price and last market price is minimal, suggesting limited recent volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (15.86):**  Suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. However, it's crucial to consider this in conjunction with other indicators.
* **PPO (-0.80):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-9.3%):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (92.6%):** This represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500 if the investment is made at the current time.  It's essential to understand the assumptions and methodology behind this prediction.  A 92.6% return is exceptionally high and should be treated with caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entries for 2024-12-06).  Analyzing the unique entries:

* **Revenue:** Revenue growth is generally upward trending although the latest quarter showed a slight decrease.  This pattern warrants further investigation with additional data and context.
* **EPS:** EPS fluctuates but there is no clear upward trend. A significant drop in EPS is observed in 2023-11-30. Additional data is necessary to interpret the variability. The duplicate entries for 2024-12-06 show a dramatic change in EPS and require clarification.
* **Comparison:** Without expectations, it's impossible to definitively determine if earnings "beat" or "missed." The reported figures demonstrate some volatility, requiring more context for comprehensive analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, with slight quarterly fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high (around 39%), demonstrating strong profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily increasing, reflecting positive growth. ROE fluctuates, with some quarters exhibiting high returns and others showing lower performance.  This variability requires further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook information was provided.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing.  This section needs supplementary data for a comprehensive assessment.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management exhibits a strong historical relative performance against the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, although the RSI indicates oversold conditions.  Earnings data presents some inconsistencies and volatility, requiring further examination for a precise interpretation of growth trends and profitability. The high projected long-term return needs rigorous justification given its significant magnitude. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits a fully informed assessment.  More comprehensive data (including historical data points, analyst forecasts, and relevant news) is crucial for a robust evaluation of WM's current standing and future prospects.

**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the available data's limitations, any strong investment recommendation is premature. Further investigation into missing data points, especially clarifying the discrepancies in the earnings data and obtaining recent market news and analyst opinions, is essential before forming a conclusive opinion. The high projected return necessitates additional analysis to determine its validity.  A comprehensive analysis incorporating more data and a thorough risk assessment is highly recommended before making any investment decisions.
