**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Waste Management (WM) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Strengths:**  The company operates in a relatively stable industry (waste management). It has increasing revenue and high profit margins.  Analyst consensus is a "Buy," and the company is returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.  The long-term expected return is very high.
*   **Weaknesses:** WM has underperformed the S&P 500. The most recent Alpha analysis is negative, suggesting underperformance relative to risk.  Recent news highlights a recent earnings miss. The RSI indicates it's approaching overbought territory.
*   **Considerations:** Despite recent challenges and underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the strong financial fundamentals, analyst ratings, and return to shareholders, make WM potentially attractive for long-term investors. However, investors should be aware of the recent volatility and potential for a short-term pullback.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data, a cautious but optimistic outlook is warranted for WM. It's not performing as well as the overall market currently, but has solid financials and good analyst ratings. Watch for continued growth in Revenue and how well it can manage to convert this to more EPS. Monitor the price movement to avoid buying into overbought situations.
