**6) Overall Analysis:**

WM has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.

Recent financial data shows strong and steady revenue growth and healthy profit margins. While recent price action indicates a minor short-term bearish trend, the overall picture suggests a strong fundamental position.  The high expected return relative to the S&P 500 warrants further consideration for long-term investors, although the recent slight price drop and the small discrepancy in the change data require continued monitoring.  Further investigation into the earnings data (specifically resolving the duplicate entry) is recommended.
