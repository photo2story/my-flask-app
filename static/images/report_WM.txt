**6) Overall Analysis:**

WM exhibits strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  While recent technical indicators suggest potential short-term correction, the long-term outlook, supported by positive alpha, growing market capitalization and a consistently profitable business, remains optimistic.  However, a deeper dive into the duplicated earnings data and a longer-term analysis of revenue and profitability trends are recommended to refine this assessment.  The high expected return warrants consideration, but should be balanced against the possibility of short-term volatility.
