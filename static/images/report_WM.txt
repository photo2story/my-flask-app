**6. Overall Analysis:**

WM demonstrates strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action shows a decline and some high-risk indicators, the long-term outlook, supported by consistent revenue growth, stable high profit margins, and positive Alpha, remains relatively bullish.  However, the recent price drop and high market risk indicator warrant caution. Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price decline and a more detailed analysis of earnings are necessary before making definitive investment recommendations. The expected return of 12.5% over a long-term horizon is promising but should be considered in light of the recent price volatility and associated risks.  Thorough due diligence is recommended before any investment decision.
