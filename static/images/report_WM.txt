## Waste Management Inc. (WM) Stock Review

This report analyzes Waste Management Inc. (WM), a leading provider of waste management services in North America, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Waste Management's cumulative return (144.99%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.85%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 24.1%, placing it in the 42.9th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (max 70.5%, min -10.7%).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $209.00
* **5-day Moving Average:** $212.56
* **20-day Moving Average:** $220.13
* **60-day Moving Average:** $215.06

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 6.35 (extremely oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.86 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -10.8% (short-term decline)
* **Expected Return:** 98.3% (long-term, 2+ years, exceeding S&P 500)

The extremely low RSI suggests the stock may be oversold and potentially due for a rebound. However, the negative PPO and recent relative divergence indicate bearish momentum. The high expected return is a long-term projection and should be considered with caution.  The current price of $209.00, being below recent moving averages, does not suggest any sudden jumps in price (neither a sharp rebound nor a crash).  Further analysis is needed to confirm this.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies and potential errors (multiple entries for 2024-12-06).  A consistent analysis cannot be performed based on the current data.  Please provide corrected and consistent data for a comprehensive analysis.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable over the past year, hovering around $5.2B to $5.6B. Profit margins are consistently high (38.67% to 39.70%), indicating strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown steady growth, reflecting a healthy financial position. Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates, but generally remains above 9%, indicating efficient use of shareholder capital. The dip in ROE during 2023-12-31 may warrant further investigation with more complete data.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or market outlook information was provided.  Adding this context would significantly improve the analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500. However, current technical indicators suggest bearish momentum in the short-term.  The extremely low RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, but this should be interpreted cautiously.  The long-term outlook, based on the provided expected return, appears positive, but this projection needs to be examined in the context of any relevant news or market analysis.  Inconsistencies in the earnings data prevent a complete assessment of the company's financial health.  Further analysis is needed to reconcile the apparent divergence between the positive long-term projections and the negative short-term indicators, especially given the incomplete earnings data and the absence of recent news.  A complete and consistent dataset is crucial for a reliable conclusion.
