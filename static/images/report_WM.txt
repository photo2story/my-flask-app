**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $211.64
* 5-Day Moving Average: $213.98
* 20-Day Moving Average: $220.56
* 60-Day Moving Average: $215.01

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* RSI: 15.86 (extremely oversold)
* PPO: -0.80 (indicating bearish momentum)
* Relative Strength Change (20-day): -9.3% (short-term downtrend)
* Expected Return (Long-Term, >2 years): 92.6% (relative to S&P 500)

The extremely low RSI suggests the stock is significantly oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. However, the negative PPO and recent relative strength decline confirm a bearish short-term trend.  The high expected return, assuming the long-term trend continues, justifies further analysis of the fundamental factors driving this growth.  The current price ($211.64) near the 60-day moving average warrants cautious optimism for potential rebound but does not signify a significant, sudden price shift.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This data was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term. While recent short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend (low RSI, negative PPO), the strong historical performance, high expected return, and generally stable financial health warrant further consideration.  The seemingly inconsistent earnings data requires clarification. The lack of current news and analyst opinions prevents a complete picture.  A deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and recent news is recommended before making an investment decision.  The current oversold condition presents a potential buying opportunity, but the risk associated with short-term market volatility should be carefully considered.
