The provided data shows a significantly higher cumulative return for WM compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **WM Cumulative Return:** 152.83%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 82.57%

The table below shows WM's significantly higher Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) than the implied CAGR of VOO over various periods, demonstrating consistent outperformance. However, the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is also notable, highlighting the risk involved.  Alpha consistently above zero suggests outperformance beyond market beta. Beta, fluctuating around 1, shows its correlation with the overall market.  Market capitalization increases over time.

* **Closing Price:** 227.47
* **5-day Moving Average:** 228.91
* **20-day Moving Average:** 228.70
* **60-day Moving Average:** 226.83

The price is slightly below its short-term moving averages, suggesting a potential minor downward pressure.  However, it remains above the longer-term (60-day) moving average, indicating a relatively healthy trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.35 (Approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential upward movement)
* **PPO:** -0.0492 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 28.4% over the long term (2+ years).

The conflicting signals from RSI and PPO require further investigation. The negative relative divergence change supports the bearish momentum suggested by the PPO. The high expected return, however, suggests a potentially attractive long-term investment opportunity.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출 (B$) |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2024-12-06 | 0.57   | 168.00     |
| 2024-08-30 | 0.56   | 167.77     |

| 2024-12-06 | 0.06   | 159.44     |


There seems to be a duplicate entry for 2024-12-06.  Excluding this duplication, revenue shows relatively consistent growth, while EPS fluctuates.  More detailed analysis requires additional financial data.  The provided data is insufficient for conclusive analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data severely limits any meaningful financial analysis.  Key financial ratios cannot be calculated without this essential information.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

WM has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the given period, as evidenced by consistently higher CAGR and positive Alpha.  However, this outperformance is accompanied by substantial maximum drawdowns, highlighting considerable risk.  Recent price action suggests a minor downward correction, supported by a negative PPO and negative relative divergence. The RSI is nearing oversold territory which could signal a rebound.  The limited earnings data and lack of crucial financial information hinder a comprehensive assessment.  The high projected long-term expected return is encouraging, but requires corroboration from more complete financial data before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the high return and risk, using more complete financial data, is strongly recommended.
