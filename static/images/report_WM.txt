**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided for analysis.  The market outlook is not specified.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM shows a strong long-term performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action indicates a potential short-term downtrend supported by technical indicators (RSI and PPO). The high projected long-term return is encouraging, but the current oversold conditions and negative momentum should be considered.  Further analysis is needed, particularly concerning the inconsistent earnings data and the absence of recent news and analyst opinions to fully evaluate the current investment opportunity. More data, especially on analyst expectations and recent news, would provide a more comprehensive picture. The strong historical performance and high expected return suggest a long-term investment opportunity, but the short-term outlook necessitates caution.
