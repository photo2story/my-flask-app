*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of risk, making it a reasonable investment candidate. The RSI indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory but hasn't crossed the threshold. The negative PPO suggests a slight downward momentum. Despite the mixed indicators, the hybrid signal recommends a 90% buy with 0% cash, emphasizing a bullish outlook. However, the recent decline in relative divergence suggests caution in the short term. Expected Return suggests strong long-term.
