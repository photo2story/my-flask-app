## Waste Management Inc. (WM) Stock Review

This report analyzes Waste Management Inc. (WM), a leading provider of waste management services in North America, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Waste Management's cumulative return (139.16%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (118.39%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 20.8%, placing it at the 38.8th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates WM's outperformance is substantial but not unprecedented within the historical context.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $204.02
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $204.81 (slightly below)
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $213.87 (significantly below)
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.90 (significantly below)

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (8.95):** Extremely oversold, indicating potential for a bounce. However, this should be interpreted cautiously given the other indicators.
* **PPO (-0.58):** Negative, further supporting the downtrend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-7.1%):** Shows a recent price decline.
* **Expected Return (60.8%):**  This represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500, assuming a consistent continuation of the historical trend.  However,  past performance is not indicative of future results. This high expectation warrants careful consideration of risk factors.
* **Current Price (204.02):** The current price being relatively low in relation to the moving averages doesnâ€™t necessarily indicate a *specific* event like a dramatic price drop, but rather reinforces the downward trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-12-06) and missing context regarding expectations.  However, based solely on the reported figures:


* **Revenue:** Revenue generally shows a trend of growth, although there is some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter.  There is no clear accelerating or decelerating pattern.
* **EPS:** EPS shows fluctuation.  There's no consistent upward or downward trend readily apparent from this limited data, and the large discrepancy between 0.57 and 0.06 on Dec 6th 2024 is a significant outlier requiring further investigation.


**5. Financial Information:**


* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, with profit margins consistently hovering around 39%.  This suggests a healthy and consistent level of profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown a consistent increase over the reported period. ROE fluctuates but generally appears healthy, although it dipped significantly in Q4 2023.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information regarding recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions was provided. This crucial information is missing and would heavily influence a complete analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management has historically outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating relative strength.  However, the current price is below its moving averages, and technical indicators (RSI, PPO) signal an oversold condition and potential for a short-term bounce. The long-term projected return is high, but extremely reliant on the continuation of historical outperformance.  Missing data on earnings expectations, recent news, and analyst opinions prevents a more comprehensive and accurate evaluation.  The considerable fluctuation in EPS and the inconsistencies in the earnings data require further investigation. While the fundamental financials look relatively strong, a more complete picture is needed before a definitive conclusion can be reached.
