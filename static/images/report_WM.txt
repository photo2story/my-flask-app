    *   Favorable market risk indicator.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Underperformance compared to the S&P 500: The cumulative return divergence indicates slight underperformance.
    *   High Maximum Drawdown:  Suggests potential for significant losses during market downturns.
    *   Overbought RSI: Suggests a possible short-term pullback.
    *   Inconsistent EPS performance.
    *   Extremely high "Expected Return" should be viewed skeptically without further context and validation.

*   **Overall:** WM appears to be a fundamentally sound company with strong financial performance and a positive long-term outlook. However, investors should be aware of the potential for short-term volatility (overbought RSI), the history of high drawdowns, and the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
