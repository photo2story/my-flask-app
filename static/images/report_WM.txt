**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Waste Management's cumulative return of 183.17% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return of 128.31%.  The difference is 54.9%, placing it at the 73.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. This indicates a strong relative performance.

The beta, hovering around 1, suggests a similar level of volatility to the overall market.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $212.23

The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. The recent drop from $228.30 to $225.65 might indicate a minor pullback, but overall the trend remains positive.

**3. Technical Indicators and Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 68.18 –  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.04 – Positive, indicating upward momentum, although relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +16.7 –  Indicates a recent period of outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The positive divergence suggests that the price is increasing faster than the relative strength index.
* **Expected Return:** 68.3% –  This represents the anticipated excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon. This is a significant potential outperformance, although it is important to consider the inherent uncertainty in long-term projections.

The drop from $228.30 is a minor correction, not a significant drop.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show some volatility. While revenue is generally increasing, EPS is inconsistent.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes of this variability, considering factors like seasonality, and one-time items.  Crucially, the most recent EPS (0.56) needs to be compared to analyst expectations to assess its performance relative to forecasts.

**5. Quarterly Financial Data Analysis:**

*(This section refers to "6) Financial Information" in the original prompt)*

The revenue and profitability data reveals consistent revenue above $5 billion per quarter, with a stable profit margin hovering around 39%.  ROE shows some fluctuation, but generally stays above 9%, indicating decent profitability.  This suggests a financially healthy and consistently performing company.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section refers to "7) News and Recent Issues" in the original prompt)*

This section requires access to real-time news sources (such as Shacknews, FINBOLD) to provide an accurate analysis of recent earnings news, market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights within the past two days.  This would include examination of any significant press releases or analyst reports that affect WM's valuation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM shows a strong track record of outperforming the S&P 500, as indicated by its significantly higher cumulative return and consistently positive alpha.  While the recent price action exhibits a minor pullback, the stock remains above its moving averages and exhibits positive momentum.  Technical indicators suggest caution (RSI nearing overbought), but the overall picture is bullish.  Consistent revenue, a stable profit margin, and generally strong ROE point towards a financially sound company. However, a closer look at the recent EPS figures (compared to expectations) and a thorough review of the latest news and analyst opinions are crucial for a complete evaluation.  The predicted long-term outperformance of the S&P 500 is considerable, but future performance is never guaranteed.
