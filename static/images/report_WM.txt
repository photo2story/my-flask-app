The difference is 20.06%, placing it at the 38th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range (max: 70.4%, min: -10.7%).  This suggests WM has generally outperformed the market, although this is relative to the provided historical context.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows consistent positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), ranging from 0.1 to 20%, and a relatively stable beta (market sensitivity) around 0.1, indicating low correlation with overall market movements.  However, the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates across the years, reflecting market volatility's impact on the company's performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $205.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $205.19
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $216.14
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.98

The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 8.57  - Extremely oversold; signals potential upward momentum, though this is an extremely low reading and could indicate a continued downturn.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.78 -  Suggests a bearish trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -4.8% - Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 110.3% -  This represents a significant potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500 if the provided analysis holds true.  The extremely high figure should be examined critically.  Given the current low RSI and negative PPO, this outlook may need revision.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies.  There are duplicate entries for December 6th, 2024.  Assuming the duplicate is an error, we focus on the remaining data. Revenue has generally increased in most recent quarters, though there was a slight dip in Q4 2023.  EPS also fluctuates; we need clearer data for comprehensive analysis.  It is impossible to assess "beats or misses" without expected EPS figures.  Furthermore, using "B$" as a unit for two different variables introduces ambiguity.



**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows consistent growth over the past year. Profit margins remain relatively stable around 39%, indicating consistent profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally increased, suggesting a healthy financial position. ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates but generally demonstrates a decent return on investment, though there's a noticeable dip in Q4 2023.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News:** No information on earnings news released within the last two days was provided.  Without this information, current market sentiment based on recent earnings cannot be assessed.
* **Recent Market Outlook and Analyst Opinions:** No information on market outlook or analyst opinions was provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a strong long-term track record based on the provided data. However, the recent price action and technical indicators (extremely low RSI and negative PPO) suggest a bearish short-term outlook. The provided expected return of 110.3% needs significant corroboration from more complete recent data.  The earnings data requires clarification due to inconsistencies.  More comprehensive data on recent news and analyst sentiment is crucial for a complete assessment.  The seemingly contradictory positive long-term outlook versus the negative short-term technical indicators requires reconciliation with further data and due diligence.
