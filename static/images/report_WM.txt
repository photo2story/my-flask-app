**6. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values suggest that WM has consistently outperformed the market (positive alpha) with higher volatility than the market (beta > 1), particularly in some periods. The significant increase in Beta in recent years shows that its price movements have become more sensitive to market fluctuations.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM exhibits strong historical relative performance against the S&P 500,  although this outperformance is not consistently high.  Recent price action shows a slight downward trend, but technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly positive outlook in the short term.  The projected long-term excess return is substantial but should be treated with caution due to inherent prediction uncertainty.  Further investigation is needed to clarify inconsistent earnings data.  The company shows generally positive financial trends in revenue, profitability, and equity, though some volatility is present.  Its high beta implies higher risk relative to the market.

**8. Disclaimer:** This analysis is based on the limited data provided.  It is not a recommendation to buy or sell WM stock.  Conduct thorough independent research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.  The high expected return should be carefully scrutinized.
