This report analyzes Waste Management Inc. (WM), a leading provider of waste management services in North America, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Waste Management's cumulative return is 140.33%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 120.68%.  The difference is 19.6%, placing it at the 37.4th percentile of its historical performance range against the S&P 500 (based on a range of 70.4% to -10.7%).  This suggests relatively strong outperformance, though not consistently extreme.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $205.02
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $205.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $215.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.95

The stock is currently trading below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 8.90 – Extremely oversold, suggesting potential for a rebound, but also vulnerability.
* **PPO:** -0.67 – Negative, confirming the downtrend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -8.2% - Indicates a recent price decline relative to its historical trend.
* **Expected Return:** 64.4% –  This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with consistent investment.  However,  the current price ($205.02) being significantly below the moving averages should be considered in light of this optimistic projection.  The low RSI suggests that a bounce may be imminent before the long-term upward trend can resume, but caution is warranted due to the overall market conditions.  A significant upward move from the current price would require a clear indication of a reversal in the market outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Generally increasing, though there's a slight dip in Q4 2023.
* **EPS:** Fluctuates, with a noticeable drop in Q4 2023.  Direct comparison with expectations is impossible due to missing data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Waste Management (WM) has historically outperformed the S&P 500. However, the current short-term price action shows a downtrend, indicated by the price being below its moving averages and extremely oversold RSI. The long-term outlook, based on the expected return of 64.4%, remains positive. However, this should be treated cautiously given the current market conditions. The company's financial health appears sound, with consistent revenue growth and high profit margins.  More information on recent earnings reports (including analyst expectations) and current market conditions is needed for a more comprehensive assessment.

A more in-depth analysis considering comparative market data, comprehensive earnings data with expectations, and current analyst sentiment is required.  While the long-term outlook appears positive based on provided data, the current short-term indicators suggest caution.
