## Waste Management Inc. (WM) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Waste Management Inc. (WM) is a leading provider of waste management services in North America.  Over the period analyzed, WM's cumulative return (146.99%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's return (118.37%).  The difference is 28.6%, placing it in the 48.5th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on provided data. This indicates a stronger performance compared to the benchmark, but the relative outperformance is not at the extreme high end of historical observations.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent positive alpha (0.1) across multiple periods, indicating that WM has generated returns above what would be expected based on its beta (market risk exposure).  The beta consistently hovers around 85, implying WM's returns are highly correlated with the overall market. However, the comparatively high beta is compensated by positive alpha.  CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies considerably across the years, indicating performance sensitivity to market conditions, though mostly positive. Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) are relatively moderate, suggesting some resilience during market downturns.  The company's market capitalization (Cap(B)) remains consistently at $85 Billion across the analyzed years, indicating a large-cap status.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $211.71
* **5-day moving average:** $209.08
* **20-day moving average:** $205.28
* **60-day moving average:** $213.82

The stock price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages but slightly below its 60-day moving average. This suggests a recent upward trend, although a slight deceleration in the trend can be seen.  The recent price change (+$0.33) suggests a minor upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 70.43 – Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.67 – Positive value indicates an upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.2 – Indicates a recent weakening of the uptrend.

The combination of a high RSI and a negative 20-day relative divergence, while PPO being positive, presents a mixed signal. While there's positive momentum, the near-term outlook might be somewhat cautious due to overbought conditions.  The expected return of 42.2% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is significant and underlines the potentially strong alpha potential.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue (B$) |

| 2024-12-06 | 0.06  | 159.44       |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-12-06.  Disregarding the duplicate, revenue shows consistent growth except for a slight dip in Q2 2024. EPS fluctuates but shows overall strength. Further investigation is needed into the discrepancy in the 2024-12-06 entries.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM exhibits strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, supported by consistently positive alpha.  Recent price action suggests a potentially decelerating uptrend, with technical indicators presenting a mixed signal (high RSI suggesting potential near-term correction but positive PPO suggesting upward momentum).  Fundamental analysis shows strong revenue growth, high and consistent profit margins, and generally robust equity and ROE. However, the earnings data needs clarification due to duplicate entries.   The high expected return relative to the S&P 500 makes WM a potentially attractive long-term investment despite the slightly overbought conditions shown by the RSI.  However, investors should monitor the stock's price action and upcoming earnings releases for confirmation.  Further due diligence is necessary before making an investment decision.
