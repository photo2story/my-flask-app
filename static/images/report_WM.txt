**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $227.47

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $226.83

The price is currently slightly above the 5-day, 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a relatively stable, but not strongly bullish, price trend.  The small price increase from the previous close is not significant enough to be considered a sharp uptrend.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.35 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so.)
* **PPO:** -0.0492 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -8.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 28.4% (Over 2 years, exceeding S&P 500 returns)

The combination of a medium risk MRI, RSI nearing oversold levels, negative PPO, and recent relative strength decline points towards a potentially bearish short-term outlook.  However, the significant expected return suggests long-term potential.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  While revenue generally increased, EPS shows fluctuations. More information is needed to draw definitive conclusions, especially regarding the significant drop in EPS from 0.63 to 0.06 in Q2 of 2024.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

WM has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong growth and consistent profitability. The long-term outlook remains positive, supported by a high projected return. However, recent data shows some signs of weakening momentum (negative PPO, declining relative strength, fluctuating EPS and ROE).  Further investigation is needed into the reasons for the fluctuating EPS and ROE to assess the sustainability of long-term growth.  Monitoring short-term indicators like the RSI and PPO is recommended to manage risk.  The duplicated data point in the earnings report needs clarification.  A more comprehensive analysis incorporating more data points and industry comparisons would provide a more robust evaluation.
