**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  While recent technical indicators suggest a slightly bearish short-term momentum, the longer-term trends remain positive.  The company maintains stable revenue and high profit margins.  However, the volatility in EPS and the lack of recent news necessitate a deeper dive into recent earnings reports and analyst predictions to solidify the outlook. The 12.09% expected return is promising, but relies on sustained past performance.  Further investigation is needed to determine whether current market conditions and potential future changes are correctly reflected in this figure.


**8. Recommendations:**

A thorough due diligence process, encompassing a review of recent earnings calls, analyst reports, and current market conditions, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  While WM has historically performed strongly, the current market environment should be carefully considered. The somewhat contradictory signals from short-term indicators (PPO slightly negative) and long-term outperformance warrant caution.  Consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate risk.  Further analysis of the provided financial data is required to make a well-informed decision.
