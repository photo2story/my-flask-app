**6. Overall Analysis:**

WM shows strong historical and recent performance relative to the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a positive outlook, though the medium risk level (MRI) should be considered.  The consistently high profit margins and increasing revenue indicate financial strength.  However, the inconsistent earnings data requires further investigation, as do the fluctuating MDD values which highlight the inherent risk associated with holding WM. The high expected return over the long term is attractive, but investors must assess their own risk tolerance given the observed volatility.  Further due diligence, including a comprehensive analysis of the corrected earnings data, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
