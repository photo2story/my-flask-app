**6) Overall Analysis:**

WM demonstrates strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Financial statements reveal healthy revenue growth and consistent profit margins. However, the recent sharp price drop and high market risk indicator necessitate further investigation into the underlying causes.  The discrepancy between the strong historical performance and the recent price drop requires careful consideration before making any investment decisions.  Clarification on the duplicate earnings data entry is also needed for a complete picture.  Despite the long-term positive outlook, the current market conditions warrant a cautious approach.
