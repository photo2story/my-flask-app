## Waste Management Inc. (WM) Investment Review

This report analyzes Waste Management Inc. (WM), a leading North American waste management company providing collection, processing, and disposal services.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

WM's cumulative return of 186.39% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return of 130.05% over the analyzed period.  The difference is 56.3%, placing it at the 75.1st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a strong relative performance. The provided Alpha values consistently show outperformance relative to the market benchmark, though the Beta indicates significant market sensitivity (high Beta values).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $228.22 (Last Market: $229.21)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $226.84
* **20-day Moving Average:** $221.64
* **60-day Moving Average:** $213.22

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The close proximity to the 5-day average and the significant difference from the 60-day average suggests recent momentum. The slight drop from the last market price ($229.21) is negligible and doesn't indicate a significant change.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.46 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.21 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** NaN (-), indicating a recent short-term decline.  This needs clarification as NaN is generally not expected here.
* **Expected Return:** 67.0% - This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment, assuming consistent past performance. The interpretation of this value is contingent upon the validity of long-term past performance as a predictor of future returns. The short term dip needs to be considered relative to this projected return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant inconsistency.  There are duplicate entries for August 30th, 2024, and the data lacks consistency in the scale of reporting (B$ implying billions, but potentially inconsistencies in the units).  A reliable analysis requires consistent and accurate data. However, based on the available data,  we can't reliably draw conclusions regarding quarterly comparisons, revenue growth trends, EPS trends, or beats/misses without clarification and complete data.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable around $5.4 Billion across the quarters. Profit margins are consistently high (around 39%), with minor fluctuations.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been steadily increasing. ROE fluctuates but is generally strong, showcasing profitability and effective use of capital.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information on recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions is provided.  This section requires additional information.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM exhibits strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, with a consistently positive alpha. Recent price action indicates a short-term dip, but the long-term trend appears upward based on moving averages. Technical indicators provide a mixed signal.  The limited and inconsistent earnings data prevents a thorough analysis.  The projected long-term return is significant, but relies on past performance continuing.  Missing information on recent news and analyst sentiment limits the overall assessment.  Further investigation into data inconsistencies and inclusion of missing information is crucial before forming a definitive investment recommendation.
