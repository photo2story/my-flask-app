## Waste Management Inc. (WM) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Waste Management Inc. (WM) is a leading waste management, recycling, and environmental services company in North America.  The cumulative return of WM (151.46%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 122.07% over the analyzed period.  The difference is 29.4%, placing it in the 49.4th percentile of the historical outperformance range (max 70.5%, min -10.7%).  This suggests relatively strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but not exceptionally so. The alpha consistently around 0.1 across the provided periods further supports a modestly positive outperformance relative to the market benchmark. Beta values fluctuating between 31 and 86 indicate varying levels of market sensitivity over time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $214.52
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $218.71
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $221.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.50

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  However, it's very close to its 60-day moving average, indicating potential support at this level. The provided last market price of 214.3 is essentially the same as the closing price, so no significant intraday fluctuation is observed that would warrant noting a "sharp upturn" or "sharp downturn."

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (42.46):** Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.68):**  Indicates bearish momentum, aligning with the moving average analysis.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-14.4%):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength against the market.
* **Expected Return (85.6%):**  This is a high expected return relative to a long-term investment in the S&P 500.  However, the source and calculation method of this number are unclear and need further clarification.  It's critical to understand the assumptions underlying this projection.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies and lacks context (e.g., missing expectations).  However, based solely on the reported numbers:

* **Revenue:** Revenue generally shows a growing trend, though there's some minor fluctuation quarter-to-quarter.
* **EPS:** EPS shows significant fluctuation.  The sharp drop in EPS between 2024-08-30 and 2023-11-30 requires further investigation into the underlying reasons.  The unusually low EPS value of 0.06 on 2024-12-06 compared to other recent values might be worth investigating further. More data would enable proper comparison to previous years and an assessment of whether these are beats or misses.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue demonstrates consistent growth across the reported quarters. Profit margins remain relatively stable and high, around 39%, showcasing healthy profitability.
* **Capital & Profitability:**  Equity shows a clear upward trend, indicating growth in the company's net assets. ROE fluctuates but generally stays positive, suggesting a reasonable return on invested capital.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent earnings news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  The lack of recent market outlook information prevents a comprehensive assessment of current sentiment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM exhibits strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, though recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with RSI hinting at potential support and PPO indicating bearish momentum.  Earnings data is incomplete and needs further context, but the long-term trajectory for revenue growth appears positive.  The projected 85.6% return requires careful scrutiny due to the lack of supporting detail.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the fluctuation in EPS and a review of broader market sentiment are crucial for a thorough investment decision.  The provided financial information suggests robust financial health with steady revenue growth and relatively high and stable profit margins.
