**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $229.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $223.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $227.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $224.33

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average and above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent price increase.  The small positive change from the previous close suggests a mild upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 53.41 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)

* **Expected Return:** 20.9% (Long-term S&P 500 outperformance)

The MRI indicates high risk, while the RSI suggests a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment. The negative PPO and negative relative divergence signal a short-term bearish trend. The positive expected return over the long-term contrasts with short-term indicators. The recent price increase of $1.29 needs further investigation into the potential catalysts driving this price change.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

There appears to be a duplicated entry for December 6th, 2024.  Excluding the duplicate, revenue shows a generally upward trend, while EPS is relatively stable except for a significant drop in Q4 2023 (possibly due to seasonality). Further analysis is needed to understand the variation in EPS.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

WM demonstrates a strong historical track record of outperforming the S&P 500. The consistently positive alpha and generally high profit margins are encouraging. However, the high Market Risk Indicator (MRI) and short-term bearish technical indicators (PPO and relative divergence) suggest caution.  While the long-term expected return is positive, investors should be aware of the potential for short-term volatility.  Further investigation is needed into the causes of the Q4 2023 EPS drop and the recent price increase.  A thorough examination of the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The seemingly strong fundamentals need to be balanced with the current risk assessment and short-term market sentiment.
