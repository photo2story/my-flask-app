## Waste Management Inc. (WM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Waste Management Inc. (WM) is a leading provider of waste management services in North America.  Its cumulative return (133.97%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (113.65%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 20.3%, placing it at the 38.2nd percentile of historical outperformance relative to its minimum and maximum deviation from the S&P 500.  The provided alpha consistently shows positive outperformance relative to the market, albeit small.  Beta, however, indicates above-average market sensitivity. The considerable size variation in market capitalization suggests growth and acquisitions.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $200.54
* **5-day Moving Average:** $202.73
* **20-day Moving Average:** $210.30
* **60-day Moving Average:** $214.64

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (11.04):**  Indicates the stock is significantly oversold.
* **PPO (-0.46):** Suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+0.2):** Shows a recent slight improvement in relative strength, but still weak overall.
* **Expected Return (62.4%):**  Represents a significant potential outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if the current price ($200.54) holds and the forecast proves accurate. The relatively low RSI and PPO despite the significant positive expected return suggests either market mispricing or a high degree of risk associated with the anticipated long-term gains.  If $200.54 reflects a significant bounce from a recent dip (e.g., a sharp decline), then this would need to be considered in the risk assessment.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue generally shows upward trending, although it has plateaued slightly in the last two quarters after increasing significantly.
* **EPS:** EPS fluctuates, with a noticeable drop in the November 2023 quarter.  The December 2024 EPS shows an increase, however, there is a discrepancy (two EPS values in the December 2024 quarter): 0.57 and 0.06. This inconsistency requires clarification.

**Overall, consistent revenue growth is present, although EPS shows inconsistencies needing clarification.**  Without further information (e.g., analyst expectations), we cannot definitively assess whether these results constitute "beats" or "misses".

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable and demonstrates consistent growth with high profit margins (around 39%).
* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity is increasing, and ROE shows some fluctuation but generally stays above 9%, indicating strong profitability.  A dip in ROE in the December 2023 quarter warrants further investigation.

**Overall, the financial information suggests a healthy and profitable company with consistent revenue generation and a strong return on equity.**


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent issues are provided in the prompt.  This section requires additional information to complete.  To provide a comprehensive review, information from recent earnings calls, press releases, and news articles would be crucial.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM currently shows strong long-term outperformance potential compared to the S&P 500. The high expected return is tempered by a recent price decline and weak short-term technical indicators (RSI, PPO).  The company displays consistent revenue growth and high profitability based on the available financial data. However, clarification is needed regarding the inconsistent EPS figures and the lack of news-related context.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the recent price decline and the EPS inconsistencies is essential for a thorough risk assessment before making an investment decision.  The relatively high beta suggests above-average market sensitivity which should also be taken into account.


**8.  Recommendations:**

Further investigation is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Clarify the discrepancies in the December 2024 EPS data and seek out recent news and analyst opinions to better understand the recent price movement and future outlook.  A thorough review of the company's risk factors and potential catalysts is crucial.
