**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Waste Management Inc. is a relatively stable company in the waste management sector, as indicated by its low Beta and consistent profitability. While the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, analysts maintain a "Buy" rating, and the news is mixed. The high expected return should be considered in conjunction with MDD (Maximum Drawdown).

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** The negative divergence from the S&P 500 is a point of concern.
*   **High MDD:** The high Maximum Drawdown indicates significant risk, particularly during market downturns.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analyst recommendations and target prices suggest potential upside.
*   **Mixed News Sentiment:** Recent news headlines present a mixed picture of the company.
*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue and profitability are robust, indicating a stable business.
*   **High Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (189.8%) should be examined with caution, as it may be overly optimistic or based on specific assumptions. This is a long-term projection (>2 years).
*   **Fluctuating Alpha:** Recent underperformance compared to benchmark is a concern.

**Overall:**  WM appears to be a stable, but somewhat underperforming, company. The analyst consensus and growth in revenue and profitability are positives. A potential investor should carefully weigh the high expected return against the high MDD and recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
