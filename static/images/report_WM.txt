*   **Analysis:** WM has historically shown decent outperformance (positive Alpha) in many periods, especially noticeable in 2015-2017, 2016-2018 and 2021-2023.  The Beta values are generally low (close to 0), meaning the stock's price is not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500).  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has varied. Recent years (2023-2025) show a significant drop in Alpha, potentially indicating underperformance relative to the market in that period. MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, suggesting periods of significant price decline.  The company's market capitalization (Cap) has generally increased over these periods.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 215.945

*   **5-day SMA:** 216.4415
*   **20-day SMA:** 209.3241
*   **60-day SMA:** 213.1125

*   **Analysis:** The 5-day SMA is above the 60-day SMA and the 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term uptrend as the recent price movement is above the longer-term average.

**3. Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 70.37 (Approaching overbought territory, but not quite there)

*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)"  (This suggests a strong buy signal based on the indicators.)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -8.4 (Short-term decline relative to VOO)
*   **Expected Return:** 187.2% (Long-term outlook suggests significant outperformance)

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a favorable investment environment. The RSI nearing 70 indicates the stock may be slightly overbought, but not dramatically so.

The recent divergence change shows short-term underperformance, but the very high expected return implies strong confidence in the company's future performance. The price fluctuation of 0.63 indicates a relatively stable recent trading day.
