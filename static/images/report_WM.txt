**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a strong cumulative return.  However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend. The RSI is extremely oversold, hinting at a possible short-term rebound, but it also underscores significant downside risk. The low PPO further confirms bearish momentum.  The high expected return over the long term is encouraging but should be viewed with caution, as it's based on the past performance which is not a guarantee for the future.  Incomplete earnings data prevents a comprehensive evaluation of the company's financial health.  Further investigation into recent news, analyst opinions, and complete earnings data is needed for a more robust conclusion.  Given the conflicting signals (strong historical outperformance, negative current technicals), a thorough risk assessment is crucial before making any investment decision.
