**6. Overall Analysis:**

WM exhibits strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, and displays several positive indicators.  However, the overbought RSI and the fluctuations in EPS and ROE warrant closer scrutiny.  The provided data suggests that long-term investment might be favorable, but further due diligence, including a review of the company's future outlook and competitive landscape, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The relatively high MDD in certain periods should also be carefully considered.   The apparent data error in the earnings table needs to be resolved.
