**6.  Overall Analysis:**

WM exhibits a strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, the data also reveals periods of significant risk (high MDD).  Recent price action shows minor weakness, but technical indicators suggest potential for further upward movement.  The company demonstrates consistent revenue growth and high profit margins.  Long-term investment prospects appear positive, given the projected outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in the earnings data and a deeper dive into the companyâ€™s future projections are warranted before making any investment decisions.  The high MDD figures must be carefully considered in the context of risk tolerance.
