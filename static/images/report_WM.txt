**6. Overall Analysis:**

WM has demonstrated strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent price movements suggest a positive trend, but RSI indicates potential for short-term correction.  Financial data reveals consistent revenue growth and stable, high profit margins.  While the expected return is substantial, the medium market risk and overbought RSI should be considered before making investment decisions.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data point is recommended.  The high beta suggests that market volatility will strongly impact WMâ€™s performance.
