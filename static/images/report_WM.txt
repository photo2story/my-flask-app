## Waste Management Inc. (WM) Investment Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Waste Management Inc. (WM) is a waste management, recycling, and environmental services company.  The cumulative return of WM is 149.92%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 120.91%.  The difference is 29.0 percentage points, placing it in the 48.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates strong relative performance, though this is relative to a historical range, not a guarantee of future outperformance.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows consistent outperformance over various periods, with the exception of 2018-2020. Alpha consistently around 0.1 suggests some degree of outperformance relative to the market, but Beta values (around 0.1 for each period) are fairly low.  This implies only slight market sensitivity.  Market capitalization has steadily increased.  Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) have been relatively manageable.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $213.20
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $215.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $220.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $214.87

The price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (22.61):**  Indicates the stock is oversold, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.77):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -11.4%, indicating a recent short-term weakening.

The current price of $213.20, while below recent moving averages, does not suggest a dramatic price movement (rapid increase or decrease) based solely on the given data.  The expected return of 86.4% over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500 suggests significant potential, but this is a projection and should not be taken as guaranteed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally increased, although there's a slight dip in the June 2024 quarter.  The data is incomplete as some quarters are missing.
* **EPS:** EPS is inconsistent, showing notable variability.  Without knowing the expectations, it is impossible to determine if there were any beats or misses.  There is an issue with duplicate data entries for Dec 2024.

**More data is needed for a comprehensive earnings analysis.**


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable in recent quarters, fluctuating around $5.4 Billion. Profit margins are consistently strong, hovering around 39%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has increased steadily. Return on Equity (ROE) shows some fluctuation, generally remaining above 9%, implying a good return on invested capital, although there are some variations within quarters.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news or market outlook, analyst opinions, or performance highlights are provided.  This information is crucial for a complete analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WM has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent price action shows a short-term downward trend, indicated by moving averages and negative PPO. The RSI suggests the stock might be oversold.  Long-term projections show strong potential relative to the market.  However, the recent earnings data is incomplete and requires more information for a proper evaluation.  Lack of recent news and analyst opinions hinders a comprehensive assessment.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent downward trend and a review of complete earnings data with expectations are crucial before drawing definitive conclusions.
