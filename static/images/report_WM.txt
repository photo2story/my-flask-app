*   **Ticker:** WM
*   **Company Name:** Waste Management Inc
*   **Overview:** Waste Management Inc. is a leading provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America.

*   **WM Cumulative Return:** 100.15%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 103.21%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current:** -3.06% (WM is underperforming VOO by 3.06%)
    *   **Range (Min: -24.4, Max: 72.9):** The difference between the maximum and minimum values is 97.3.
    *   **Relative Divergence:**
    Calculate Relative Divergence = (Current_Divergence - Min_Divergence) / (Max_Divergence - Min_Divergence) = (-3.06 - (-24.4)) / (72.9 - (-24.4)) = 21.34/97.3 = 21.9%
        (Relative divergence indicates the current position when the minimum-maximum fluctuation range is set to 100. For example, a relative divergence of 90 means it is located at the top 90% percentile of past data, not that it is 90% superior to the comparison stock.)

**Analysis:** WM has underperformed the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative return. The current divergence suggests WM is currently underperforming the S&P 500. The relative divergence suggests that the current divergence is near the low end of its historical range.
