## VICI Stock Analysis:

**Company Overview:** VICI Properties Inc. (VICI) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates a portfolio of gaming, hospitality, and entertainment destinations. 

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500:**

VICI's current cumulative return of 51.27% lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) by 32.1% (83.37% - 51.27%).  This means VICI has underperformed the market over the period analyzed. The relative divergence indicator, however, suggests that VICI has been relatively strong during this time, sitting at the 38.08th percentile of its historical performance range.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Current Price:** $33.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $33.6
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $32.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $30.58

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting potential bullish momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 86.12
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.03
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +8.27 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected_Return:** 12.52% (maximum expected return over the next 5 years)

The high RSI level indicates VICI is in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a near-term correction. The PPO suggests a slight bullish trend, but it is not a strong signal. The positive Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence indicates a recent short-term upward trend. The expected return of 12.52% is relatively high, potentially attracting long-term investors. 

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date | EPS | Expected EPS |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-07-31 | 0.71 | 0.68 |
| 2024-05-01 | 0.57 | 0.66 |
| 2024-02-22 | 0.72 | 0.65 |
| 2023-10-25 | 0.55 | 0.63 |
| 2023-07-26 | 0.69 | 0.62 |

The most recent earnings report for Q2 2024 shows a slight beat on estimates, with EPS coming in at $0.71 compared to expectations of $0.68. This positive trend in recent earnings could support further growth in the stock price.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

VICI has exhibited strong growth over the long term, and recent earnings have shown a positive trend. However, the current price is overbought, indicated by the high RSI. Although the Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence suggests potential short-term upside, investors should be cautious and watch for potential pullbacks due to the high RSI. The high expected return could be an attractive factor for long-term investors. 

**6. Final Recommendation:**

VICI remains a potentially promising investment with a solid track record, especially for long-term investors. However, the current overbought conditions suggest a near-term pullback is possible. Investors should monitor the price action closely and consider entering a position at a more favorable entry point.
