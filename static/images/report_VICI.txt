**Performance Analysis:**

1. **Relative Performance:** VICI has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by approximately 19.16% as of the most recent data point. This represents a 32.93% relative underperformance compared to its historical range. 
2. **Recent Price Action:** VICI's recent price action indicates a bullish trend. The stock is trading above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, indicating upward momentum.
3. **Technical Indicators:** VICI's RSI of 87.5 suggests the stock is currently overbought, indicating a potential for a correction. However, the PPO of 0.19 suggests that the stock's momentum is strong, and the positive delta_previous_relative_divergence (7.21) suggests a short-term upward trend. This divergence may indicate potential for further upside, but the overbought RSI suggests a correction may be on the horizon.
4. **Recent Earnings and Outlook:** VICI's recent earnings have been consistently exceeding expectations. In the most recent quarter (ending July 31st, 2024), VICI reported an EPS of $0.71, exceeding analysts' expectations of $0.68. This trend of exceeding expectations suggests strong operational performance and a positive outlook.

**Overall Analysis:**

VICI is a company with a strong track record of earnings growth and exceeding expectations. Despite its recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500, its positive technical indicators and strong earnings suggest a bullish outlook for the company. However, the high RSI does suggest a potential for correction. Investors may want to monitor the stock closely for signs of a pullback, while also keeping an eye on any potential catalyst for continued growth. The current expected return of 18.0% is based on the potential for continued growth, but investors should factor in the possibility of a correction and manage their risk accordingly.
