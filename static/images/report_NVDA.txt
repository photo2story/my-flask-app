## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

NVIDIA Corp is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as a provider of related software and services.

The cumulative return for NVDA is 4677.39%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.09%.  The difference is 4556.3%, placing it at the 81.7th percentile of the historical range of performance differences (max: 5580.1, min: -9.9).  This indicates exceptionally strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500 throughout the observed period.  The high Beta values in the provided data (ranging from 81.1 to 3288.8) suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements, contributing to the significant outperformance and underperformance at different times. The Alpha values consistently around 0.1 indicate some degree of consistent outperformance relative to the market's risk-adjusted returns.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $127.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $136.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $138.77

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price increase (+$0.77) indicates a slight upward movement, but it needs further confirmation to signal a reversal of the downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 39.66  (Below 40 suggests the stock might be oversold.)
* **PPO:** -1.28 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 546.8% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 projected over the long term.)

The combination of a low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence points to a bearish short-term outlook, despite the recent slight price increase. However, the extremely high projected long-term return suggests potential for significant upside if the longer-term trend continues.
