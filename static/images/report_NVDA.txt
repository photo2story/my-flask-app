## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

NVIDIA Corp is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and related technologies.  This report analyzes NVDA's performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), examining recent price movements, key indicators, earnings, and financial information.  The analysis suggests strong historical performance and high growth potential, but also highlights current market vulnerability.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

NVIDIA's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.

* **NVDA Cumulative Return:** 1729.86%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 65.78%
* **Return Difference:** 1664.1%
* **Relative Deviation:** 56.3% (This indicates NVDA's performance is significantly higher than the S&P 500, considering historical volatility).


The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data further reinforces this strong outperformance, particularly in recent years (2019-2025). However, high Beta values indicate significant market sensitivity.  High Alpha values suggest that NVDA's performance exceeds what would be expected based on its Beta and market movements alone.

The large daily drop necessitates a deeper investigation into the cause. While the long-term outlook remains positive based on historical performance and expected returns,  investors should exercise caution given the current market conditions and short-term price weakness.  Further research into recent news and market factors is crucial before making investment decisions.
