2025-12-03 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive report and analysis of NVDA based on the data provided:

**1. Return Rate Comparison (NVDA vs. VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** NVIDIA Corp is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) used in gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and automotive markets.

*   **Simple Numbers:**
    *   NVDA Cumulative Return: 987.7%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 100.4%
    *   Divergence (NVDA - VOO): 866.9
    *   Relative Divergence: 76.8

*   **Analysis:** NVIDIA has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period examined. The cumulative return of NVDA is almost 10x that of VOO. The divergence of 866.9 is quite large. A relative divergence of 76.8 indicates that the current outperformance, relative to the historical range of outperformance, is positioned in the upper percentile (76.8th percentile).

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

*   **Simple Numbers:**
    *   The table presents annual rolling period performance. Key metrics are CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), MDD (Maximum Drawdown), Alpha, Beta, and Market Cap (in Billions).

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** NVDA has shown extremely high growth rates in certain periods (e.g., 2015-2017, 2019-2021, 2022-2024, 2023-2025), but also experienced a significant decline in the 2018-2020 period. This points to high volatility.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown has consistently been high, fluctuating around 75-80%, indicating significant risk and large potential losses.
    *   **Alpha:**  Alpha is generally very positive, indicating NVDA has consistently outperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis (positive Alpha = outperformance; negative Alpha = underperformance).
    *   **Beta:** Beta values are mostly low (ranging from -0.0 to 0.6), suggesting that NVDA's price is not highly sensitive to market movements.
    *   **Cap:** Market Cap has grown substantially, reflecting the company's growth and investor confidence.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Simple Numbers:**
    *   Current Close: 181.37
    *   Last-Market: Price 181.42, Previous Close 179.92, Change 0.83
    *   5-day SMA: 179.8
    *   20-day SMA: 187.80
    *   60-day SMA: 185.01

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, potentially suggesting a short-term downward trend or consolidation. However, the 5-day SMA is below the current price which means that the last 5 days have been trending upwards. The stock is close to the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting that these levels may act as resistance.

**3. Indicators Analysis**

*   **Simple Numbers:**
    *   MRI: 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
    *   RSI: 34.45
    *   PPO: -0.70
    *   Hybrid Signal: 100% Buy (Very Safe)
    *   Recent Relative Divergence Change: -2.7 (short-term decline)
    *   Expected Return (%): 235.9%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A high MRI score (0.9) indicates a favorable market environment.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 34.45 is below 30, generally considered oversold, which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity. But the fact it is not trending downwards, means it is not oversold and instead just bearish.
    *   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-0.70) suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a downward trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The "100% Buy" signal suggests the stock is favorable.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative divergence change suggests a short-term downward trend relative to the comparison stock (S&P 500).
    *   **Expected Return:** A 235.9% expected return is *highly optimistic* and should be viewed with caution. It implies significant future growth potential *if* the assumptions underlying the model hold true.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Headlines:**
    *   Nvidia stock considered almost historically cheap.
    *   Morgan Stanley became more bullish on Nvidia.
    *   Amazon's AI chip raises questions about Nvidia's dominance.
    *   Another AI stock is "secretly crushing" Nvidia.
    *   Nvidia invests $2 Billion in Synopsys.
    *   Analyst calls focusing on Nvidia.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The news is mixed. While some articles suggest Nvidia is undervalued and analysts are bullish, others highlight increasing competition from Amazon's AI chips and a potentially better-performing AI stock. The investment in Synopsys is generally positive. The news suggests both potential upsides and looming competitive threats.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Summary:**
    *   Consensus: Strong Buy (1.33)
    *   Target Price: $250.66 (Average)
    *   Analyst sentiment is strongly positive.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The strong buy consensus indicates analysts are optimistic about Nvidia's future performance.
    *   The average target price of $250.66 suggests substantial upside from the current price. However, the range of target prices is wide ($140 to $352), implying considerable uncertainty among analysts.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

NVIDIA presents a mixed picture. On one hand, the company has demonstrated impressive historical growth and continues to enjoy strong analyst support. The company is undervalued based on some news sources. The high MRI score and a "Strong Buy" consensus from analysts also support a positive outlook.

However, several risks are apparent:

*   **High Volatility:** The high maximum drawdowns and periods of significant decline underscore the stock's inherent volatility.
*   **Increasing Competition:** The emergence of competitors like Amazon in the AI chip market poses a credible threat to Nvidia's future market share and profitability.
*   **Short-Term Downtrend:** Technical indicators like the negative PPO and recent negative relative divergence change suggest a short-term downward trend.

**In Summary:** NVIDIA is a high-growth, high-risk stock. The strong historical performance, positive analyst sentiment, and potential for future growth make it attractive. However, investors need to be aware of the substantial volatility, increasing competition, and potential for significant losses. A measured approach to investing in NVDA is advisable, considering the level of risk tolerance and investment time horizon. Monitor upcoming events and new headlines.
