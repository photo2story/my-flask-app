## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets.  The cumulative return of NVDA is 5297.51%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.36%. The difference in cumulative returns is 5177.2%, placing NVDA at the 92.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance over the period considered. The provided data shows exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures for NVDA over various periods, ranging from 76% to an astonishing 4722%. However, it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures highlight the significant risk associated with NVDA's volatile performance.  Despite the high beta (mostly above 1), indicating higher volatility than the market, the alpha consistently remains positive, suggesting the stock has generated excess returns compared to the market benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $140.83
* **5-day Moving Average:** $136.02
* **20-day Moving Average:** $137.79
* **60-day Moving Average:** $139.48

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 60-day moving average indicates the recent price increase isn't excessively detached from the longer-term trend. The recent price increase (Last-market data shows a positive change) suggests a potential short-term uptrend, though this needs further analysis considering the historical volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 53.75 –  Slightly above neutral (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.02 – A positive value indicates upward momentum, albeit weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +5.1 – Shows a short-term positive relative divergence, reinforcing the short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 399.1% – This represents a substantial projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, this projection must be viewed with extreme caution due to the inherent volatility of NVDA. The significant increase in price from the previous close ('change' value in Last-market data is positive), might indicate a minor positive correction, but more data is required for a definitive assessment. The high expected return reflects the historical exceptional performance but should not be interpreted as a guaranteed future outcome.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

NVDA has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters. This positive trend suggests strong financial performance and market confidence.  The consistent beat in EPS signifies the company is managing its earnings effectively, which is a positive sign.

**7.  Overall Analysis:**

NVDA exhibits exceptional historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Strong financial metrics, consistent earnings beats, and positive technical indicators suggest a robust company with high growth potential.  However, the high volatility and significant maximum drawdowns highlight the inherent risk associated with investing in NVDA.  The exceptionally high projected long-term returns should be treated with caution, and investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing.  Further due diligence, including analysis of future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors, is essential before making any investment decisions.
