## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets.  The provided data shows a significant outperformance of NVDA compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for NVDA is 5263.23%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 120.73%.  The difference in cumulative returns on the last day of the data is 5142.5%, placing it at the 92.2nd percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial degree of outperformance.  The high alpha values across all periods further confirm this superior performance, significantly exceeding the benchmark (S&P 500).  The beta values, however, show significant volatility and high exposure to the market, implying amplified gains but also higher risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $138.81
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $142.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $142.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $134.94

The current price is slightly below both the short-term (5 and 20-day) moving averages, suggesting a potential slight downward pressure.  However, it is above the longer-term (60-day) moving average, indicating a relatively healthy trend in the longer timeframe.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.25 (Slightly below neutral; not overbought or oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.2975 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +0.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 3000.9% (Significant outperformance of S&P 500 projected)

The RSI is close to neutral, while the negative PPO suggests a slightly bearish momentum. The positive short-term relative divergence indicates a recent upward trend.  The high projected return (3000.9%) is based on past performance, and future performance is inherently uncertain.  The price of $138.80 is not exhibiting any signs of a sharp upward or downward movement based on this data alone.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company consistently exceeded EPS expectations in all reported quarters.  Revenue growth is also clearly positive, showcasing consistent increases from quarter to quarter. Profit margins remain relatively stable and high.  This points to a robust and growing business.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NVIDIA's performance has been exceptionally strong, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  The company shows consistent revenue and earnings growth, high profit margins, and improving financial health. While some short-term technical indicators suggest potential downward pressure, the long-term outlook appears very positive.  However, the high beta suggests significant risk.  The exceptionally high projected return should be viewed with caution, as it's based on past performance and doesn't guarantee future results. Further research into market outlook, analyst opinions, and recent news is needed for a comprehensive assessment.
