2025-12-03 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of NVDA based on the data provided:

**1. Return Rate Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** NVIDIA Corp. is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and related software, primarily known for its applications in gaming, data centers, and artificial intelligence.

*   **Return Comparison:**

    *   NVDA Cumulative Return: 988.24%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 100.36%
    *   Divergence: 866.9
    *   Relative Divergence: 76.8

*   **Analysis:** NVDA has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by a wide margin. The relative divergence of 76.8 indicates that the current divergence between NVDA and VOO is in the upper 77th percentile of its historical range. This highlights NVDA's exceptional growth compared to the broader market.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    *   The data showcases a high level of Alpha across most periods, indicating that NVDA's performance is exceeding what would be expected based on market movements alone.
    *   Beta values are consistently low, which might be counter-intuitive given the high volatility often associated with tech stocks. However, a low Beta with high Alpha indicates strong, independent performance.
    *   CAGR has been remarkably high in several periods (e.g., 2015-2017, 2019-2021, 2022-2024, 2023-2025), demonstrating periods of rapid growth.
    *   MDD values are consistently high, which suggests significant drawdown risk, which would correlate with the high growth.
    *   The capitalization (Cap) has grown substantially over time, reaching very high levels, indicating the scaling of the firm.

*   20-day SMA: 186.53

*   **Analysis:** The recent price movement indicates a slight downward trend. The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which could be interpreted as a short-term bearish signal. The 5-day SMA being below the 20-day SMA further reinforces this. The slight drop of -0.71 reflects the recent fluctuations.

*   Expected Return (%): 235.9%

*   **Analysis:**

    *   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, meaning the model views NVDA as a relatively safe investment despite potential risks.
    *   The RSI of 38.54 is nearing oversold territory (below 30), which could suggest a potential buying opportunity if investors believe the stock is undervalued.
    *   The negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, further suggesting bearish momentum.
    *   The hybrid signal recommends buying NVDA with all available cash, signaling a strong buy recommendation. The recommendation to invest monthly suggests a long-term bullish outlook.
    *   The negative change in relative divergence (-2.7) over the last 20 days indicates a short-term decline relative to the S&P 500.
    *   The expected return of 235.9% is exceptionally high, signifying substantial potential upside if held long-term (over 2 years).

*   **Key Takeaways:** The news landscape is mixed. While analysts generally maintain a positive outlook and some see it as undervalued, competition in the AI space is heating up, posing a potential threat to NVDA's dominance.

The stock seems to be undervalued relative to its potential, as reflected in both the high expected return and analyst target prices. The recent short-term downturn could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors.
