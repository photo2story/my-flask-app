NVDA has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  The cumulative return difference is substantial, highlighting NVDA's exceptional growth.  The provided alpha and beta values indicate periods of high outperformance (high alpha) and also high sensitivity to market movements (high beta), particularly in recent years.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $120.07
* **Previous Close:** $124.65
* **Change:** -$3.67 (approx. -3%)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $123.17
* **20-day Moving Average:** $135.72
* **60-day Moving Average:** $138.51

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 39.46 (Below 40 indicates oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -1.52 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** -15.4% (Significant negative divergence, confirms short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 597.2% (This represents a significant projected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, but it's crucial to remember that this is just a projection, not a guarantee)

The recent price drop (-3%) reflects a combination of factors that may include market corrections, potential profit-taking after a strong run-up, and possibly concerns about future growth.  The combination of low RSI and negative PPO suggests the stock may be oversold and potentially primed for a rebound, but further downward movement is possible in the short term.

NVDA has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters.  This positive trend supports the strong growth narrative.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

NVIDIA (NVDA) demonstrates a remarkable growth story, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action shows a short-term bearish trend,  the company's strong financials, consistently beating earnings expectations, and high projected long-term returns suggest a potentially compelling investment opportunity for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance due to its high beta. However, the high beta also implies significant market risk; price volatility should be anticipated.  The current oversold conditions (RSI below 40) may signal a potential short-term buying opportunity, but this should be considered within the context of broader market conditions and personal risk tolerance.  Further research, including fundamental analysis beyond the provided data, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
