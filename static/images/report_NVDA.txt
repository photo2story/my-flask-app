* **20-Day Moving Average:** $137.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $139.52

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 47.81 - This suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory but not yet definitively so.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.24 -  A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.

* **Expected Return:** 420.1% - This is a very high expected return over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, significantly exceeding the expected return of the S&P 500.  This should be treated cautiously, as any prediction involving such high returns warrants further independent verification. The significant recent price increase (3.10) likely contributes to the high expected return and suggests a short-term market response to positive news. However, caution should be used since this might be a short-lived price increase.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NVDA shows exceptionally strong performance, exceeding the S&P 500 by a significant margin.  Consistent earnings beats, high profit margins, increasing revenue, and a robust financial position support this strong performance. However, the high beta suggests substantial market risk.  While the projected long-term return is exceptionally high, investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making investment decisions. The current technical indicators present a mixed picture, with some suggesting potential near-term downward pressure, while others indicate continued strength.  The high expected return should be viewed with skepticism given the inherent volatility and uncertainty of stock market forecasting.  It's crucial to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results.
