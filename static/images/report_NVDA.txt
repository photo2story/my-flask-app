## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets.  The cumulative return of NVDA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns is 5178.9 (5296.46 - 117.56).  This places NVDA's performance at the 92.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided data.  The provided alpha and beta values show consistently high alpha (significantly outperforming the market) and dramatically increasing beta (high volatility correlated to the market), particularly from 2019 onwards. This high beta highlights the increased market sensitivity of NVDA's stock price in recent years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $139.67
* **Last Market Price:** $140.22
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $132.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $136.96
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $137.56

The stock price is slightly above its 20 and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a moderately bullish short-term trend. However, the gap between the closing price and the 5-day moving average points to a recent price increase.  A price of $140.22 would indicate a continuation of the recent upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 49.28 (slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.22 (negative; suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +5.4 (positive; indicating recent upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 3077.2% (significantly higher than S&P 500; requires careful consideration due to the high volatility implied by the data)

The conflicting signals from RSI and PPO, coupled with the positive short-term relative strength, suggest a period of consolidation or potential short-term volatility. The extremely high expected return underscores the potential for substantial gains but also highlights the significant risk.  A price of $140.22 reflects a recent upward trend and does not necessarily imply a sudden jump.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

NVDA has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in the last five quarters.  Revenue has shown a clear upward trend, increasing each quarter.  Profit margins remain strong and consistently above 70%. This demonstrates consistent growth and strong financial performance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NVDA shows exceptionally strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. While recent technical indicators present mixed signals, the consistently strong financial performance, exceeding EPS expectations, and upward revenue trends paint a positive picture. However, the high beta and substantial expected return highlight significant volatility and risk. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in NVDA.  The high expected return is based on a continuation of current positive trends which cannot be guaranteed.  Further research into the current news and market outlook is crucial before making any investment decisions.
