## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets.  The cumulative return of NVDA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between NVDA and VOO as of the last data point is approximately 6870.2%.  This represents a high degree of outperformance relative to the historical range of outperformance (93.3% percentile).  The provided data shows extremely high alpha values, suggesting significant outperformance relative to the market benchmark, but it's crucial to consider the high beta values, indicating substantial market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Price:** $140.26
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $137.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $142.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $133.15

The last market price ($143.85) is slightly higher than the closing price. The price is above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages but below the 20-day moving average, suggesting some recent consolidation or minor pullback after a potential period of growth.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 38.83  - Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. However, this should be considered alongside other indicators.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.82 -  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN - Lack of data prevents analysis of short-term divergence.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 3863.3% - This represents a significant projected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This projection should be viewed with caution due to the high volatility of NVDA historically. The high expected return is highly dependent on continued strong growth, which is not guaranteed.  A 3863.3% return is exceptionally high and unlikely to be realized consistently.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NVDA shows exceptional performance relative to the S&P 500, exhibiting significant growth and consistent profitability.  While the high expected return is very compelling, investors should note the high beta, indicating significant volatility.  The positive earnings surprises and improving financials further support the strong performance.  However, a complete analysis requires current news and market context to assess potential risks and future outlook accurately.  The RSI suggests a potential buying opportunity, but the negative PPO and lack of data on relative divergence require further investigation.  A comprehensive analysis also needs to factor in macroeconomic conditions and competitive pressures within the industry.
