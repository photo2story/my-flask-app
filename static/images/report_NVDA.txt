## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

* **Cumulative Return (NVDA):** 4792.64%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 120.63%
* **Return Difference (NVDA vs VOO):** 4672.01%
* **Relative Divergence:** 83.8% (Indicates NVDA significantly outperformed VOO historically,  but within the context of its historical volatility)


**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

NVIDIA Corp is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as a provider of AI and data center solutions.

NVDA's cumulative return massively surpasses that of the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The relative divergence highlights that NVDA's performance has consistently outpaced VOO, though the magnitude of this outperformance fluctuates.  The provided alpha and beta values demonstrate periods of both high alpha (outperformance) and high beta (volatility correlated with the market). Note that beta values are exceptionally high, indicating significant market sensitivity.  The high CAGR values reflect periods of explosive growth, particularly noticeable from 2019 onwards.  However, periods of high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) also indicate substantial risk associated with investing in NVDA.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $128.68
* **Last Market Price:** $128.12 (a slight decrease of $0.44 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $121.78
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $131.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $137.15

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The recent price movement shows a minor dip, but does not represent significant price volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 46.92 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.70 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +2.1% (Suggests short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 524.4% (Significantly outperforms VOO projection over the long term)

The slightly negative PPO and RSI values near the oversold boundary, combined with positive 20-day relative strength, indicate a mixed signal. The substantial expected return reflects the historical outperformance and high growth potential. However, this projection comes with substantial risk given the volatility inherent in the stock.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NVIDIA (NVDA) exhibits a history of exceptional growth and substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500. Recent earnings consistently beat expectations.  However, its high beta indicates significant market risk. While the long-term outlook appears positive based on the expected return, investors should be aware of the high volatility and potential for significant drawdowns.  The current price position below its moving averages suggests a short-term bearish trend, although this does not negate the long-term potential.  A thorough risk assessment is crucial before investing in NVDA.  It is advised to consider diversification strategies to mitigate portfolio risk given the high volatility associated with this stock.
