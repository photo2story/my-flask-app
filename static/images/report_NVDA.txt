| 2020-2022  | 282.0% | 32.0%  | 0.1   | 349.0 |       |
| 2021-2023  | 1330.0%| 32.0%  | 0.1   | 1182.0|       |
| 2022-2024  | 3804.0%| 32.0%  | 0.1   | 3150.0|       |

The table shows exceptionally high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) and significant Alpha, suggesting substantial outperformance against the market benchmark (implied by Beta).  However, the data lacks the market benchmark used for alpha and beta calculation.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth over the years.  Max Drawdown (MDD) appears relatively low considering the substantial returns, but the context of the benchmark is unclear.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $132.0
* **Last Market Price:** $128.58
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $135.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $139.82
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $136.58

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The last market price is significantly lower than the closing price indicating a negative shift.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.08 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.81 (Negative, confirming bearish sentiment)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.8% (Short-term bearish trend)

The combination of RSI and PPO values points towards bearish momentum. The negative relative divergence change reinforces this.  The significant drop from closing price to the last market price ($132 to $128.58) suggests a potential short-term price correction (a sharp drop).  The projected long-term (2+ years) expected return of 3217.5% relative to the S&P 500 is exceptionally high and should be viewed with caution, as it's likely dependent on factors not included in this report.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NVIDIA shows exceptionally strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, with consistently high revenue and profit growth.  Recent earnings have exceeded expectations.  However, short-term indicators suggest a potential bearish trend.  The extraordinarily high projected long-term return should be treated with extreme caution given the lack of context and supporting data.  Further research is needed to understand the context of the high alpha, beta, and expected return figures.  Crucially, missing information on recent news and analyst opinions prevents a complete assessment of current market sentiment and future prospects.
