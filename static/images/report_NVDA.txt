## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Report

**0) Introduction:** NVIDIA Corp is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as a major player in artificial intelligence.

**1) Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

The cumulative return of NVDA is 1582.09%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 76.31%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 1505.78%.  The relative divergence of 50.4% indicates that NVDA's performance is currently positioned in the upper half of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this relative measure must be interpreted cautiously, as it solely reflects historical performance, not a guarantee of future returns.  The significantly high alpha values in the provided table further highlight NVDA's outperformance compared to the market benchmark.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $98.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $102.80
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $106.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $117.90

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $2.04 from the previous close indicates a short-term upward movement but needs further observation to confirm a trend reversal.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.74 (Slightly below neutral, suggesting potential further downside)
* **PPO:** -0.33 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1098.4% (This is a very high projected return and should be viewed with caution.  It's crucial to consider the inherent risks and volatility associated with such a projection, particularly given the already high valuation of NVDA.)


The recent price increase of $2.04, while notable, is not significant enough to classify as a "sharp rebound" given the context of the other indicators.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

NVIDIA has demonstrated exceptional performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. While recent price action suggests a potential short-term pullback, the strong earnings, robust financial health, and high projected returns (though requiring cautionary interpretation) paint a largely positive picture.  However, it's crucial to acknowledge the high valuation of NVDA and the inherent risks associated with investing in a high-growth technology company.  The projected 1098.4% return should not be taken as a definitive prediction but rather as a potential indication of long-term upside, provided the current positive trends continue. A thorough risk assessment and diversification are essential before making any investment decisions.  Furthermore,  the high beta values indicate significant market sensitivity.
