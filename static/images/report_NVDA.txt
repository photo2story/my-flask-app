| 2023-2025 | 1271.0% | 74.6% | 1239.0% | 0.6   | 3302.1 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Extremely high growth rates across all periods, indicating significant investment return.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values suggest significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently high alpha indicates substantial outperformance relative to the market.  This suggests strong management and/or a favorable industry environment.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, especially in earlier years. This suggests that the stock has had low correlation with the market
*   **Cap:** Market capitalization has grown dramatically, reflecting investor confidence and valuation increases.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 135.40
*   **Previous Close:** 134.83
*   **Change:** 0.42
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 131.7
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 115.28
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 114.32

**Analysis:** The current price is above all moving averages, indicating a strong upward trend.  The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day and 60-day, further confirming short-term bullish momentum. The small `change` value might suggest a consolidation period after a rapid ascent.

**3. Market Risk and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.347 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 92.67 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 2.42
*   **Recent (20-Day) Relative Deviation Change:** 9.4 (Positive - Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 709.6% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The low MRI suggests that, based on the model, the overall market risk is currently low, but this does not negate risks specific to NVIDIA.
*   The RSI being significantly overbought indicates that the stock *may* be due for a correction or period of consolidation.  However, strong growth stocks can remain overbought for extended periods.
*   The positive change in relative deviation and PPO confirms the recent outperformance trend.
*   The very high expected return suggests strong confidence in NVIDIA's long-term growth potential *relative* to the S&P 500. However, a 709.6% return is a very optimistic projection, and investors should consider it as a potential upside rather than a guaranteed outcome. The recent price change of 0.42 is relatively small, suggesting no immediate significant volatility.

**7. 종합적인 Analysis (Overall Analysis)**

NVIDIA exhibits exceptional financial performance, highlighted by remarkable revenue and earnings growth, coupled with substantial outperformance against the S&P 500. The company's high alpha and beta, along with consistent earnings beats and significant revenue growth, underscore its strong market position and efficient operations. The low Market Risk Indicator (MRI) and substantial expected return of 709.6% compared to the S&P 500 suggest a bullish outlook. However, the overbought RSI and news indicating potential market volatility necessitate careful monitoring. While NVIDIA's financial health is robust and the stock demonstrates significant long-term growth potential, investors should remain vigilant of short-term risks and market fluctuations.
