## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as a significant player in artificial intelligence (AI) hardware and software.

The cumulative return of NVDA is 7048.5%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 124.78%.  The difference in cumulative returns on the last day is 6923.72%.  The relative divergence of 94.0% indicates NVDA's performance is at the 94th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, suggesting exceptional outperformance.  The alpha consistently surpasses 1.0, indicating superior returns relative to the market benchmark.  Beta values generally exceeding 1.0 suggest higher volatility than the market but also the potential for magnified gains.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth over the years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $140.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $144.69 (Slightly below)
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $142.06 (Slightly below)
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $128.83 (Significantly above)

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term bearish momentum. However, it is significantly above its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend.  The discrepancy between short-term and long-term averages could signal a potential correction or consolidation before resuming the uptrend.  The difference between the last market price (140.2) and the closing price (140.15) is negligible.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.64 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.56 (Slightly negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -6.0% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 278.04% (Long-term projected excess return over S&P 500)

The RSI suggests a neutral market sentiment, while the negative PPO confirms the short-term bearish pressure.  The negative relative divergence strengthens this.  However, the high expected return of 278.04% over the long term (2+ years) suggests substantial potential despite recent short-term weakness.
