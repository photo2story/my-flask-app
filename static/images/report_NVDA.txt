## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:**

NVIDIA Corp is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets.  This report analyzes NVDA's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering recent price movements, financial indicators, and earnings.  NVDA has significantly outperformed VOO, but current indicators suggest a potentially volatile period.


**1) Performance Comparison:**

NVIDIA (NVDA) has demonstrated exceptionally strong performance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **NVDA Cumulative Return:** 2444.11%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 85.44%
* **Return Difference:** 2358.67%

The relative divergence of 59.9% indicates that NVDA's performance is currently at the upper end of its historical performance range relative to VOO.  While this suggests strong outperformance, it also implies a potentially high degree of risk given its elevated position. The provided Alpha and Beta values showcase high Alpha values across the years (except for 2016-2018 and 2017-2019), signifying consistent outperformance relative to the market (Beta represents market sensitivity).  However, the high Beta values in recent years signal increased volatility.  High CAGR values demonstrate strong year-over-year growth, but MDD (Maximum Drawdown) reveals periods of substantial losses.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $101.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $108.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $113.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $124.90

The closing price is significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a recent downward trend.  The large negative change (-7.81) from the previous close suggests a potential sharp price drop.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk) - While moderate risk is indicated, the relatively low RSI and negative PPO values suggest oversold conditions.
* **RSI:** 23.56 (Oversold) -  A reading below 30 typically indicates an oversold condition, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO:** -0.70 (Bearish) - A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -6.5% (Short-term Downward Trend)
* **Expected Return:** 931.4% - This exceptionally high expected return, relative to the S&P 500, is crucial to consider alongside the significant risks involved.

The large price drop of -7.81 reflects a sharp downward movement.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

NVDA has exhibited remarkable growth and outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, the recent sharp price drop, coupled with technical indicators suggesting an oversold market, points to a period of potential volatility.  While the company's fundamentals remain strong, investors should exercise caution given the current market conditions and high relative valuation. The extremely high expected return of 931.4% should be interpreted cautiously, taking into account the associated risks inherent in such a high-growth, high-volatility stock. Long-term investors with a high-risk tolerance might consider investing, but thorough due diligence and diversification are crucial.
