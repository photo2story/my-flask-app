* **5-Day Moving Average:** $100.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $111.81
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $122.46

The closing price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential for further upward movement or consolidation.  The recent price change of $18.72 (from $96.30) shows a significant and rapid increase.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.41 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet there).
* **PPO:** -0.3946 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum).
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.9 (Short-term upward trend).
* **Expected Return:** 849.8% (Long-term projected outperformance relative to the S&P 500).

The high MRI suggests a high risk associated with NVDA. Although the RSI is nearing oversold conditions, the negative PPO and high MRI suggest caution is warranted.  The recent price surge, however, points to a possible short-term positive trend. The significant expected return is a positive long-term outlook.
