## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

NVIDIA Corp is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and related technologies.  This report analyzes NVDA's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering recent price movements, financial indicators, and earnings.  NVDA demonstrates significantly higher returns than the benchmark, but current indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition with significant risk.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

NVDA has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.

* **NVDA Cumulative Return:** 1579.44%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 71.02%
* **Return Difference:** 1508.42% (This represents the difference in cumulative returns at the last data point)
* **Relative Divergence:** 52.9% (This indicates NVDA's performance is in the upper quintile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500).

The provided CAGR data reinforces this significant outperformance across various periods, with exceptionally high growth rates in recent years.  However, the high beta values suggest significant market sensitivity. Alpha values show periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $94.31
* **Previous Close:** $101.80
* **Change:** -$7.49 (Significant daily drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $105.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $112.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $124.14

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The significant negative daily change suggests a possible sharp correction.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4782 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 20.62 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential upward correction but also high vulnerability)
* **PPO:** -1.35 (Negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 925.2% (Long-term projected excess return over S&P 500)

The combination of overbought conditions (RSI near 20), negative PPO, and a high Market Risk Indicator points to a potentially risky situation, despite the long-term growth potential.  The recent sharp price drop (-7.49) reflects this risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

NVDA has consistently exceeded EPS expectations.

| Date       | EPS   | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| 2025-02-26 | $0.89 | $0.848       | Beat      |
| 2024-11-20 | $0.81 | $0.75        | Beat      |
| 2024-08-28 | $0.68 | $0.64        | Beat      |
| 2024-05-22 | $0.61 | $0.56        | Beat      |
| 2024-02-21 | $0.52 | $0.46        | Beat      |

Consistent positive earnings surprises are a positive sign, supporting the expectation of future growth.


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability metrics show strong growth.  However, the equity growth rate is slower than the revenue growth, which might affect certain financial ratios over time.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $39.33B       | 73.03%        |
| 2024-10-31 | $35.08B       | 74.56%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $30.04B       | 75.15%        |
| 2024-04-30 | $26.04B       | 78.35%        |
| 2024-01-31 | $22.10B       | 75.97%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity       | ROE           |

| 2024-01-31 | $42.98B       | 28.58%        |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NVDA has demonstrated exceptional long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, the recent sharp price drop, coupled with oversold technical indicators and high market risk, suggests a potentially volatile period. While the strong financial performance and consistent earnings beats are positive signals, investors should carefully consider the high risk indicated by the technical indicators before making investment decisions. The high expected long-term return should be weighed against the potential for further short-term corrections.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy with dollar-cost averaging could mitigate some of the short-term risk.
