* **20-Day Moving Average:** $142.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $131.47

The stock is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it's above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 32.02 – This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce back is possible, but it's not a definitive buy signal.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.22 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.3% – This indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 3936.4% – This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment. This is a high expected return and needs to be interpreted cautiously, considering the inherent uncertainties associated with long-term projections.  The high expected return reflects past performance which is not indicative of future results.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The company has consistently exceeded earnings per share (EPS) expectations in recent quarters.  The latest reported EPS ($0.81) surpassed the estimate ($0.75). This trend of exceeding expectations suggests positive market sentiment and strong financial performance. However, past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

NVDA has demonstrated exceptional performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action shows a short-term dip, the strong financial performance, high profit margins, and consistent earnings beats paint a positive picture.  The high expected return is enticing, but investors should acknowledge the inherent risks associated with high-growth tech stocks and the volatility implied by its high Beta.  Oversold conditions (RSI) might suggest a potential bounce, but it's crucial to monitor the market outlook and analyst opinions (obtained from sources mentioned in section 6) for a more informed investment decision.  The current price is close to its 60-day moving average suggesting some level of support, but the situation warrants further investigation.
