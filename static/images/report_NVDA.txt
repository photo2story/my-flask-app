## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets.

The cumulative return of NVDA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between NVDA and VOO as of the last data point is 7112.1. This places it at the 96.6th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, indicating exceptionally strong outperformance.  The provided data shows substantial outperformance over various periods, with exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)  and Alpha values. However, it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results. The high Beta values reflect the stock's volatility, which is significantly higher than the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $145.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $141.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $143.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $134.24

The price is currently above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's not far from its 20-day average and still relatively close to the 60-day moving average suggesting recent price action is relatively modest.  A closing price of 145.01 does not show any significant sharp jump or drop from prior trading days, even though it is close to the recent peak values.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.79 (Slightly below neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** -0.1965 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:**  NaN (-) This requires further clarification or data, since "nan" means there is missing data. It's a negative change (short-term downward trend) based on the data description, but the amount needs more info.
* **Expected Return:** 3758.7% (This is a remarkably high figure and should be treated with extreme caution.  It represents a projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming current trends continue. This is highly unlikely, especially given the high Beta and inherent risk associated with such a high growth expectation.)

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

NVIDIA has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters. The trend shows a steady increase in actual EPS compared to the previous quarters.  The company has consistently delivered positive surprises compared to anticipated earnings per share values.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**6. News and Recent Issues:**  (This section requires up-to-date information from recent news sources concerning earnings announcements, market outlook, and analyst opinions to complete this section.)


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NVDA has demonstrated exceptional growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this extraordinary performance is also associated with considerable risk, indicated by its high beta.  While the recent earnings and financial data are exceptionally positive, the projected 3758.7% long-term expected return is highly improbable and unsustainable.  Investors should be aware of the inherent volatility and manage risk appropriately, focusing on a long-term perspective and diversification.  Further research into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high valuation should also be carefully considered.  The missing data for the relative divergence indicator requires further investigation.
