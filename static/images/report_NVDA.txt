| 2023-2025  | 699.0%   | 80.3% | 635.0%  | 0.6 | 4326.9  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows impressive growth, especially in recent periods (2019-2025).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Indicates significant risk, with drawdowns consistently high.
*   **Alpha:** Positive Alpha indicates NVDA's outperformance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500).  The large positive Alphas in many periods confirm the strong returns relative to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta values generally increased toward 0.6 over time. A beta of 0.6 indicates NVDA is 60% as volatile as the market. The -0.0 Beta value in 2015-2018 is unusual and needs investigation.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** Demonstrates exponential growth in market capitalization, reflective of NVDA's rising stock price.

**Analysis:** The analysis shows NVIDIA delivered significant positive excess return. The high MDD, however, indicates that NVIDIA's shares can be subject to substantial losses, and the investor should keep that in mind when trading the shares.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **60-day SMA:** 185.98

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day). This *could* suggest a short-term downtrend, or that the stock is currently undervalued. The 5-day SMA is closer to the current price than the 20 and 60-day, showing a recent stabilization.

*   **RSI:** An RSI around 50 indicates a neutral condition – neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** A slightly negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, hinting at potential weakness but not strongly so.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Signal recommends utilizing 90% of available cash to buy one share.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The positive change in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend relative to the comparison stock.
*   **Expected Return:** The 221.1% expected return is very high, suggesting significant potential upside if held long-term (over 2 years), but also implying inherent risk.
*   **Fluctuation Issue:** The note about `{'price': 177.72, 'previousClose': 176.29, 'change': 0.81}` is negligible and does not reflect any noticeable rebound or decline.
