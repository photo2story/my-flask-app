## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

NVIDIA Corp is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as a major player in AI.  This report analyzes its recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and provides insights based on provided financial and technical indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

NVIDIA's cumulative return (2661.98%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (89.25%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 2572.7%, placing it at the 65.3rd percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 (based on a range of -9.3% to 3943.7%).  This highlights NVDA's exceptional growth, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data further reinforces this exceptional performance, particularly in recent years (2019-2025).  While Beta values generally indicate high market sensitivity,  the Alpha values (especially in recent years) suggest substantial outperformance compared to the market benchmark.  High CAGR is offset by significant maximum drawdown (MDD), highlighting the inherent volatility of the investment.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $109.67
* **Last Market Price:** $105.43 (a decrease of $3.87 or -3.53%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $115.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $115.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $127.17

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend. The recent price drop of 3.53% indicates a possible period of correction.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 53.32 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.06 (Negative; suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -5.1% (Short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return:** 779.6% (Long-term expected return significantly outperforming the S&P 500)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the MRI suggests relatively low risk, the negative PPO and recent relative strength decline indicate potential short-term weakness.  The significant price drop warrants attention for signs of further decline or potential rebound. The substantial expected return reinforces long-term bullish sentiment.

NVIDIA exhibits exceptionally strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action indicates a potential short-term correction, the robust financial fundamentals, consistent earnings beats, and high expected returns suggest a positive outlook for long-term investors.  However, the high volatility (as evidenced by the MDD) requires careful consideration of risk tolerance.  Further analysis incorporating broader macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape is recommended before making any investment decisions.
