NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets.  The cumulative return for NVDA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between NVDA and VOO as of the last data point is 4817.1%,  indicating a substantial outperformance.

The beta, however, fluctuates significantly, ranging from 81.0 to 3193.0,  indicating considerable volatility and sensitivity to market movements, especially in later years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $130.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $134.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $139.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $136.82

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.58 (Slightly below neutral; suggesting potential oversold conditions but not a strong buy signal).

The current price of $130.39 is below the 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages.  While not necessarily indicating a sharp drop, it does suggest a period of consolidation or slight downward pressure. The expected return of 3268.5% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 represents a very high projection and must be viewed with caution. Such high projections are highly dependent on continued strong growth, which is not guaranteed.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NVIDIA is demonstrating exceptional growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. Its financial performance is robust, with high revenue, profit margins, ROE, and consistent EPS beats. However, the high beta signifies substantial volatility.  The short-term technical indicators suggest potential downward pressure, but the long-term outlook, based on past performance, remains positive.  However, it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the projected 3268.5% long-term return is extremely high and therefore should be viewed with caution.  Further analysis using current market news, analyst opinions, and up-to-date financial data is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation.
