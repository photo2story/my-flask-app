The cumulative return of NVDA is 977.03% compared to VOO's 100.58%, resulting in a significant divergence of 866.9. The relative divergence of 76.8 indicates that the current divergence is quite high compared to historical fluctuations.
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis Interpretation:**
    *   **Alpha:** Measures the stock's excess return compared to the market (S&P 500). NVDA generally shows high positive alpha, especially in the periods 2015-2017, 2019-2021, 2022-2024, and 2023-2025, indicating significant outperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. NVDA's beta is relatively low (between 0 and 0.6), suggesting that it has a somewhat weaker correlation to the market, in the meantime, there seems no correlation between the Beta index and stock return rate.
    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate exhibits substantial volatility across different periods.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown fluctuates between approximately 74% and 80%, indicating substantial risk exposure.
