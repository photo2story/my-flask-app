The current price is slightly below its 60-day moving average, hinting at potential resistance.  While the short-term trend appears positive,  investors should carefully consider the market risk and volatility before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment horizon might be suitable for this stock given its growth potential, but thorough due diligence and risk management are crucial.
