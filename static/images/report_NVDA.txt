## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and related technologies.

The cumulative return of NVDA is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 4880.73 - 114.36 = **4766.37**.  The provided relative divergence of 85.4% indicates that NVDA's performance relative to the S&P 500 is in the top 85.4% of its historical range.  This suggests exceptionally strong outperformance.  The alpha consistently remains above 0, highlighting substantial outperformance beyond market movements.  The high beta values show a strong correlation with market volatility, however the significantly higher return more than compensates for this.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $128.91
* **5-day moving average:** $132.58
* **20-day moving average:** $138.43
* **60-day moving average:** $136.95

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.69 - This indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a short-term buying opportunity. However, it's crucial to consider the broader context.
* **PPO:** -1.05 - A negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -7.1% - This reinforces the short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return:** 3312.8% -  This represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500, if the current price of $128.91 holds or increases.  This high projection should be viewed with caution due to the inherent volatility of stock markets.  This exceptionally high projection needs to be verified against external market predictions.

This pattern suggests the company is performing better than analysts' predictions.
