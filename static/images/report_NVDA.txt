    *   **High:** 352.00
    *   **Low:** 140.00

*   **Analysis:**  The strong buy consensus and high average target price suggest that analysts, on average, are optimistic about NVIDIA's future performance.  The range in target prices (140.00 - 352.00) indicates some level of uncertainty. No recent rating changes.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis Summary**

NVIDIA has demonstrated exceptional historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. The high alpha and CAGR reflect this, but the high MDD also indicates substantial risk.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn, and the recent headlines reflect both positive analyst sentiment and concerns about market headwinds.

The MRI suggests a medium risk investment. While the expected return is very high, the recent stock price decline and negative news should be considered.  The analyst consensus is overwhelmingly positive, with a "Strong Buy" rating and a significantly higher average target price than the current price.

**In conclusion:**

*   **Positive Factors:** Strong historical performance, positive analyst ratings, high expected return, bullish hybrid signal, and growth in its sector.
*   **Negative Factors:** Recent price decline, negative news headlines, high maximum drawdown, and potential short-term downward trend based on moving averages.
*   **Overall:** NVDA presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The company's fundamentals appear strong, but recent market volatility and mixed news necessitate caution. Investors should weigh the potential for substantial returns against the risk of significant losses. Monitor the news flow and further price action.
