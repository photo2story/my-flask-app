## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets.  Over the given period, NVDA significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for NVDA is 5177.93%, while the S&P 500's is 118.37%. The difference in cumulative returns is a massive 5059.56%. This places NVDA at the 90.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating exceptional outperformance.  The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) ranging from 76% to 4602% over various periods, highlighting significant growth.  However, it's important to note that high growth often comes with increased risk, as evidenced by the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures. The consistent Alpha above 0 suggests NVDA has generated returns exceeding its benchmark even after considering its Beta (market sensitivity), which is relatively high (around 0.1). Note that Beta values reported are unusually low for a stock with such high volatility and return.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $137.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $134.50
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $137.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $139.52

The price is slightly below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  However, the proximity to these averages indicates relative stability.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 47.81 – This indicates the stock is nearing oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.24 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.1 – This indicates short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 420.1% – This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if the current price holds. The 420.1% number, considering the inherent risk in such projections, should be interpreted cautiously.   Given the exceptional past performance shown, there's a risk of mean reversion (lower future returns).

**7. Overall Summary:**

NVDA has demonstrated exceptional performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Consistent earnings beats, strong financial metrics, and positive short-term momentum suggest a healthy company. However, the high valuation and past performance raise concerns about future returns, particularly in light of the unusual Beta values reported.  The high expected long-term return should be considered in the context of this risk.  Further research into the industry landscape, competitive threats, and valuation is warranted before making any investment decisions.  The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest caution in the short term. A more conservative investment approach with a diversified portfolio is recommended, given the high risk associated with this stock's volatility.
