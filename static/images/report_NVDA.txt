2025-01-15 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) based on the provided data, presented in a report format.

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a technology company designing graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets.

The cumulative return of NVDA is 4949.89%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.74%.  The difference in cumulative returns is a staggering 4837.1%. The relative divergence of 86.7% indicates NVDA's performance lies in the upper 86.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This highlights NVDA's exceptional performance compared to the broader market.  The high Alpha values across all periods further support this outperformance, indicating consistent returns above the benchmark. The significantly high Beta values, particularly in recent years, show a high sensitivity to market movements but are also a consequence of extraordinary growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $131.76
* **5-day Moving Average:** $136.23
* **20-day Moving Average:** $136.645
* **60-day Moving Average:** $139.708

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 46.75  (Slightly below neutral; not oversold, but approaching it)
* **PPO:** -0.39 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -12.0% (Short-term downward trend)

The RSI suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory, but not quite there. The negative PPO confirms bearish momentum,  consistent with the moving averages. The negative relative divergence change further supports the short-term bearish sentiment. Given the closing price of $131.76 is below the moving averages, this supports the observation of a short-term downtrend.  There's no evidence of a sharp upward or downward price movement.  The expected return of 462.5% over a long-term horizon (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is extremely high and should be viewed with caution.  Such high projected returns are rarely sustainable.
