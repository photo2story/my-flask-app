    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 99.09%
    *   Divergence: 845.28
    *   Relative Divergence: 74.9
*   **Company Overview:** NVIDIA Corp is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) that enhance the experience on computing platforms.

*   **Simple Analysis:** NVDA has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return is approximately 9.5 times higher than the S&P 500. The divergence of 845.28 indicates a massive performance gap.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis**
    *   **Key Metrics Overview:** The table breaks down performance over rolling 3-year periods. CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) reflects the average annual growth. MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline. Alpha measures outperformance relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500), and Beta measures volatility relative to the benchmark. Cap(B) refers to market capitalization in Billions.
    *   **CAGR and MDD Trends:** CAGR varies wildly, reflecting NVIDIA's growth spurts and market corrections. High MDD values signify significant risk.
    *   **Alpha and Beta Observations:** Alpha is generally positive, suggesting consistent outperformance when positive. Beta is consistently around 0 to 0.6 over the period, indicating that NVDA's price is not significantly affected by the volatility of the market.
    *   **Market Capitalization:** Market cap has grown exponentially, especially in recent periods, signaling significant investor confidence.
    *   **In summary:**  The data highlights NVIDIA's high-growth, high-risk profile.  Periods of exceptional returns are often followed by periods of substantial drawdown. While NVIDIA has consistently outperformed (positive Alpha), the Beta values do not indicate significant volatility of the company compared to the S&P 500.
