**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500:**

NVDA's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  NVDA's cumulative return is 4937.91% compared to VOO's 120.85%, a difference of 4817.06%.  The relative strength index suggests NVDA is in the 86.3 percentile of its historical performance range against VOO.

**Company Overview:** NVIDIA Corp is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming and professional markets, and has expanded into high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  Consistently high alpha across all timeframes indicates significant outperformance compared to the market, while the low beta suggests lower volatility relative to the market. However, it's important to note that the provided beta values seem unusually low for a technology stock like NVDA.  Further investigation into the calculation methodology for these figures is recommended.

* Closing Price: 130.39
* Last Market Price: 135.04
* 5-Day MA: 134.66
* 20-Day MA: 139.33
* 60-Day MA: 136.82

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting short-term downward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators:**
