**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) demonstrates NVDA's substantial growth over the specified periods, with a remarkable increase in recent years.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates the potential risk of loss during the examined periods.
*   **Alpha:** A consistently positive Alpha suggests that NVDA has outperformed its benchmark (presumably the S&P 500) after adjusting for risk. The higher the alpha, the better the risk-adjusted performance.
*   **Beta:**  A Beta around 0.0-0.6 suggests NVDA's price is less volatile than the market (S&P 500).  However, recent periods show increasing Beta, indicating NVDA's price movements are becoming more correlated with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization is growing rapidly from 117.8B to 4566B.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 187.54
*   **Previous Close:** 188.22
*   **Change:** -0.36
*   **5-day SMA:** 188.822
*   **20-day SMA:** 182.1583
*   **60-day SMA:** 186.12

**Analysis:**

The price decreased slightly compared to the previous close. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, which could suggest a short-term upward trend, but the current price is below the 5-day SMA, indicating a potential pullback. The 20-day SMA being below the 60-day SMA indicates a possible consolidation or sideways movement in the medium term.
