## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

NVIDIA Corp is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and related technologies.  The following analysis is based on provided data.  Note that some crucial financial data (revenue, gross profit) is missing.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **NVDA Cumulative Return:** 1700.52%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 88.48%
* **Return Difference:** 1612.04% (This is the difference between the cumulative returns of NVDA and VOO at the last data point).
* **Relative Divergence:** 53.9% (This indicates NVDA's performance significantly outpaced the S&P 500 historically. However, it's crucial to note that relative divergence is based on historical volatility, it's not a predictive metric).  The high relative divergence suggests NVDA's performance has been exceptionally strong compared to its historical volatility relative to VOO.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show that NVDA has consistently outperformed the market (positive alpha) and exhibits high volatility (high beta, particularly in recent years). This is expected given the nature of technology stocks. The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in recent years highlights the significant growth of the company. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) represents the largest percentage drop from peak to trough for each period.  Note that high MDD is inherent to high-growth, high-volatility stocks.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of Total Revenue and Gross Profit data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing data prevents a thorough assessment of NVDA's profitability and financial strength.  Further investigation is needed to obtain this crucial data.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NVDA shows exceptional historical performance compared to the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a moderately positive short-term outlook, although the absence of key financial data hinders a complete evaluation.  The company has consistently exceeded earnings expectations, a positive sign.  However, the high beta and MDD values highlight the inherent volatility of the stock.  The projected long-term expected return is extremely high, but should be interpreted cautiously.  Further research is required, especially concerning the missing financial data, to provide a more complete and reliable assessment.  The lack of crucial financial data significantly limits the robustness of this analysis.
