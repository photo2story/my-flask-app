**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets.

The cumulative return for NVDA is 5086.28%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 4969.85%.  The provided relative divergence (89.1%) indicates that NVDA's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been exceptionally strong compared to its historical range.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data further highlights NVDA's exceptional performance over various periods, ranging from 76% to a staggering 4510%.  Despite high maximum drawdown (MDD) values, indicating periods of significant price decline, the substantial returns significantly outweigh these risks.

* **Closing Price:** $135.32
* **Last Market Price:** $137.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $134.49
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $136.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $139.65

* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -3.3% – This indicates a recent short-term decline in the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 436.7% – This represents a significant potential return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) assuming current trends continue.  However, it's crucial to understand that such high projections inherently carry significant risk.
