**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $110.15
* **Last Market Price:** $109.66 (a decrease of $0.44 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $110.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $114.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $126.26

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.99 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.32 (Negative value, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -7.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 788.5% (Significant excess return over S&P 500 expected over 2+ years)

The recent price drop (-$0.44) is relatively small and doesn't suggest a significant event.  However, the combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence reinforces the bearish short-term momentum. The high long-term expected return reflects the company's strong past performance and future growth potential, but this should be considered in the context of high historical volatility.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NVDA exhibits exceptionally strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. Recent earnings and financial data indicate a healthy and growing company. However, current price action shows short-term bearish momentum, and the high historical volatility should be considered. While the long-term outlook remains positive based on the provided data, investors should monitor short-term market trends and manage risk accordingly.  The high expected return should be viewed cautiously, as it reflects past performance and does not guarantee future returns.  A diversified investment strategy is recommended.
