## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Summary:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and related technologies.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), NVDA has significantly outperformed. The cumulative return of NVDA is 4937.91%, while the S&P 500's is 120.85%.  This represents a substantial difference of 4817.06%.  The relative divergence places NVDA at the 86.3rd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  The provided alpha and beta analysis shows consistently high alpha values, indicating strong outperformance relative to the market, along with a high and increasing beta indicating high market sensitivity.  Note that the extremely high CAGR values are partially due to the shorter timeframes of analysis.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $130.39
* **Last Market Price:** $135.22
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $134.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $139.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $136.82

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The difference between the last market price and the closing price suggests a recent decrease in value.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.58 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.95 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.3% (Short-term downward trend)

The negative PPO and recent relative divergence suggest bearish momentum.  The RSI is nearing oversold territory, which could signal a potential bounce, but confirmation is needed.  The expected return of 3268.5% over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500 suggests significant potential, though this figure is extremely high and should be viewed with caution given inherent uncertainty.  A last market price of $135.22 does not indicate a significant recent rapid price change (either up or down) compared to the closing price, given the relatively small price difference.

NVDA has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in the past five quarters.  The trend shows a steady increase in EPS, indicating positive earnings growth.
