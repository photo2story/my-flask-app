A long-term investment strategy with regular contributions might be suitable for risk-tolerant investors, but thorough due diligence and consideration of market volatility is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The absence of recent news and analyst opinions limits the ability to fully assess the current market sentiment surrounding NVDA.
