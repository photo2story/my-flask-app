**Recommendation:**

Given the strong long-term growth potential (high expected return), NVIDIA remains an attractive investment. However, due to the volatility and signs of potential short-term pullback, a strategy of gradual accumulation with a focus on risk management is recommended. Monitoring news and financial reports closely is crucial. The Hybrid Signal's recommendation to reduce holdings should be considered in the context of your individual risk tolerance and investment goals.
