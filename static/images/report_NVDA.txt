### 7. 종합 분석 (Overall Summary)

NVDA는 S&P 500을 크게 능가하는 엄청난 성과를 보여주었지만, 최근 주가 하락과 혼조세의 뉴스 헤드라인, 그리고 단기 약세를 나타내는 지표들은 주의가 필요함을 시사합니다. 분석가들의 컨센서스는 여전히 강력한 매수세이지만, 목표 주가의 범위가 넓다는 것은 의견이 분분함을 보여줍니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 꾸준한 수익성, 높은 매출 성장, 그리고 AI 시장에서의 잠재력은 장기적인 투자 전망을 밝게 합니다. 시장 위험 지표는 낮지만, 하이브리드 신호는 신중한 접근 방식을 권장합니다.

**In English:**

NVDA has demonstrated tremendous outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent price declines, mixed news headlines, and indicators suggesting short-term weakness warrant caution. Analyst consensus remains strongly bullish, but the wide range in target prices highlights differing opinions. Nevertheless, consistent profitability, high revenue growth, and potential in the AI market make the long-term investment outlook bright. While the market risk indicator is low, the hybrid signal recommends a cautious approach.
