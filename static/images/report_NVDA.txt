## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets.  Its cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between NVDA and VOO as of the last data point is 4998.3%.  This places NVDA at the 89.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating a substantial outperformance.  The provided data shows exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values ranging from 52% to a staggering 3922% over various periods.  These high CAGRs, however, are accompanied by substantial Beta values suggesting high volatility and correlation to overall market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $135.07
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $141.30
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $141.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $135.25

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it is slightly above its 60-day moving average.  The last market price of $139.75 indicates a recent price increase from the closing price, which might be interpreted as a slight price rebound.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 32.90 -  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -0.55 - Suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.6% - Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.

The significant difference between the last market price ($139.75) and the closing price ($135.07) suggests a recent price increase, potentially indicating a short-term rebound.  The expected return of 3097.9% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is extremely high and should be viewed with caution.  This projection is likely based on historical high growth, and such extreme future performance is not guaranteed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

NVDA has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in the past five quarters.  The company has shown consistent revenue and EPS growth, although the growth rate appears to be moderating slightly in recent quarters.

Current market outlook will depend on broader macroeconomic factors, and analyst opinions will vary.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NVDA has demonstrated exceptional historical growth significantly outpacing the S&P 500. However, this extreme growth is accompanied by high volatility.  Recent price action suggests a possible short-term correction or consolidation after a period of significant gains.  While fundamental data (earnings, revenue, profitability) remains strong, the extremely high projected future return requires careful consideration. The current RSI and PPO indicators suggest a bearish sentiment in the short term. Investors should carefully weigh the potential for continued high growth against the risks associated with high volatility and a potentially overvalued stock.  Further research into recent news, market sentiment and analyst opinions is vital before making any investment decisions.
