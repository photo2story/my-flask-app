## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

NVIDIA Corp is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as a significant player in the rapidly growing AI market.  This report analyzes NVIDIA's performance based on provided financial and market data, assessing its growth trajectory and comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NVIDIA's cumulative return (1754.68%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (66.27%).  The difference (1688.4%) places it at the 57.2nd percentile of its historical performance range against the S&P 500 (max difference: 2961.4%, min difference: -10.6%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and substantial Alpha (outperformance relative to the market) particularly in recent years, suggesting strong market-beating performance.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $110.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $120.83

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.35 (from $110.71) indicates a minor upward movement.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NVIDIA demonstrates exceptionally strong performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 across various metrics.  The company's financial health is robust, with consistently high revenue, profit margins, and ROE.  While the recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction, the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by strong earnings beats and a high projected long-term return.  However, investors should be aware of the high Beta, implying significant market sensitivity.  The high projected long-term return should be considered cautiously, as it is a projection based on past performance and is not a guarantee of future results.  Further due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.
