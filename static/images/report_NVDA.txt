## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets, as well as a provider of related software and technologies.

Over the observed period, NVDA's cumulative return (7341.27) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (125.68). The difference is 7215.59, placing it at the 97.96th percentile of its historical relative divergence against the S&P 500.  This indicates exceptionally strong performance relative to the broader market.  The high alpha values in the provided data further support this outperformance, consistently exceeding the market benchmark.  The high beta values, while indicating higher volatility, are overshadowed by the substantial alpha generated.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $145.89 (Last Market: $147.55)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $144.36
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $142.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $129.47

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the 5-day MA indicates recent price stability.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (66.47):**  Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions, but leaning towards the overbought territory.
* **PPO (-0.39):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum, although it's relatively close to zero.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (0.9+):** Indicates a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (280.18%):** This represents a significant projected excess return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  The significantly higher last market price ($147.55) compared to the closing price slightly contradicts the relative divergence data suggesting a potential short-term correction, but does not change the long-term positive outlook.
