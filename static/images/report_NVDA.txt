**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $110.93
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $105.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $110.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $121.63

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a relatively stable short-term trend. However, it's below the 60-day average, indicating a potential downward correction. The recent price increase of $3.12 (from the previous close) represents a significant positive change.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.81 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** 0.46 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 867.2% (Significant excess return compared to S&P 500)


The MRI suggests high risk, while the RSI indicates a potential for a short-term bounce. The positive PPO and upward relative divergence support a short-term bullish outlook, however the larger context is a very high risk. The expected return is exceptionally high, but this should be viewed with caution given the high risk assessment.  The significant price increase should be considered â€“ it could be the start of a larger upward trend, or a temporary spike before a correction.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NVDA demonstrates exceptional growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Positive earnings surprises, strong financial statements, and positive momentum indicators (PPO, relative divergence) suggest continued strength. However, the high MRI and the recent price jump warrant caution.  While the long-term outlook appears exceptionally bullish (supported by high projected returns),  investors should be aware of the inherent high risk associated with this level of outperformance and consider diversifying their portfolio.  The current price is approaching overbought conditions, so caution is advised for short-term investors.  A potential pullback may occur before the next upward leg.  Further research is recommended before making any investment decisions.
