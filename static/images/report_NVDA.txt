*   **Competition:** The AI chip market is becoming increasingly competitive.
*   **Market Sentiment:** Overall market conditions and investor sentiment toward growth stocks can impact NVIDIA's performance.

Therefore, while the data suggests a positive outlook, investors should conduct their own thorough research and consider their individual risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.
