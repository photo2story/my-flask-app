2025-12-07 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of NVIDIA (NVDA) based on the data provided.

**1. Performance Comparison: NVDA vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **NVDA Overview:** NVIDIA Corp. is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and system on a chip units (SoCs) for the gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive markets.
*   **NVDA Cumulative Return:** 977.03%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 100.58%
*   **Divergence:** 866.9
*   **Relative Divergence:** 76.8 (Indicates the divergence is currently positioned at the 76.8th percentile of its historical range).

**Analysis:** NVDA has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 by a large margin. The divergence of 866.9 highlights this substantial difference. A relative divergence of 76.8 suggests that while the outperformance is significant, it's not at the absolute peak of its historical outperformance range. The Alpha, Beta Analysis table reveals strong alpha generation (outperformance relative to the market) across most periods, coupled with a relatively low beta (market sensitivity) suggesting NVDA's returns are driven more by company-specific factors than overall market movements. The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in recent years points to rapid growth, but high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates significant volatility.

Here's the breakdown of the Alpha, Beta Analysis table:

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B)  |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|---------|

| 2023-2025  | 710.0% | 80.3%  | 645.0% | 0.6   | 4441.1  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the annualized growth rate over the period.  High CAGR indicates strong growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. High MDD indicates significant risk.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the outperformance of the investment relative to the market.  A positive Alpha indicates outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Measures the investment's volatility relative to the market. A Beta close to 0 suggests little correlation to the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** Reflects the company's market capitalization.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 179.59
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 182.41, Previous Close: 183.38, Change: -0.53
*   **5-day SMA:** 179.94
*   **20-day SMA:** 185.43
*   **60-day SMA:** 185.38

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below both its 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The 5-day SMA is also below the 20-day SMA, reinforcing this bearish signal. The recent change of -0.53 in the last market data signals a continuing decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.41 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.43 (Slightly Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -2.7 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 235.9%

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. The RSI of 36.41 is nearing the oversold territory (below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity. The PPO is slightly negative, reinforcing the bearish short-term trend.  The 20-day divergence change indicates recent underperformance. The very high expected return of 235.9% suggests significant potential upside if held long-term (over 2 years), but this should be considered alongside the inherent risks. The Hybrid Signal recommend to Buy based on MRI = 0.9

The high target of $352.00 indicates some analysts are extremely optimistic. The range between the high and low target prices highlights the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future performance.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

NVIDIA has demonstrated exceptional growth and significantly outperformed the S&P 500, largely driven by its leadership in GPUs and AI-related technologies. The company exhibits high growth, coupled with significant volatility.

*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   Strong historical performance (high cumulative return, high CAGR).
    *   High Alpha, indicating outperformance relative to the market.
    *   Strong Buy analyst consensus with a significant average price target.
    *   High expected return (235.9%).
    *   Leadership in key growth areas like AI and data centers.

*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   High MDD, indicating significant price volatility and risk.
    *   Recent short-term downtrend (price below moving averages, negative PPO, recent divergence decline).
    *   News articles highlighting potential competition and cash management challenges.
    *   RSI approaching oversold territory.

*   **Overall Assessment:**

NVDA presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. Its long-term potential remains substantial, driven by its dominance in key technology sectors. However, investors should be aware of the inherent volatility and potential headwinds from increased competition and market fluctuations. The Strong Buy analyst consensus and high expected return should be balanced against the recent short-term negative price action and the mixed news sentiment. The MRI suggesting a medium investment indicates a balanced view of the risks and potential rewards.
