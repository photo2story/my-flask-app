## NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) is a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming and professional markets.

The cumulative return of NVDA is 5366.11%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 52.12%.  The difference in cumulative returns is approximately 5314.0 percentage points.  While the provided relative divergence of 93.7% indicates a high position relative to past performance compared to the S&P 500, this should be interpreted cautiously; it doesn't directly translate to future outperformance.  The exceptionally high alpha values in the provided table further highlight NVDA's significant outperformance compared to the market benchmark.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha values consistently exceed 100%, demonstrating substantial outperformance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500) across the analyzed periods.  The beta consistently around 1.0 suggests that the stock's price movements correlate closely with the overall market. The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over time reflects NVDA's impressive growth.  However, it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $142.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $143.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $139.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $139.73

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend.  However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term uptrend.  The recent price drop of approximately $3.12 (from the previous close) warrants observation for any potential underlying factors.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.98 (slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.66 (positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +6.5% (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 407.3% (significantly higher than the S&P 500)

The technical indicators show a generally positive outlook, with upward momentum. The substantial expected return reflects the market's expectation of continued high growth for NVDA, exceeding that of the S&P 500.  The recent price drop, however, should be monitored.  It's important to remember that these projections are based on current market sentiment and forward-looking estimates; they are not guarantees of future performance.
