**Analysis:**

*   **Significant Outperformance:** NVIDIA has *significantly* outperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined, as shown by the massive divergence in cumulative return. The relative divergence suggests this outperformance is near the higher end of its historical range.
*   **High Alpha:** The consistent positive alpha indicates NVIDIA is generating returns above what would be expected based on its market exposure (beta). The large Alpha values in many periods highlight its ability to deliver excess returns.
*   **Beta:** NVIDIA's Beta is low, meaning NVDA is less correlated with the market. 
*   **CAGR:** The very high CAGR for several periods shows strong growth. However, the negative CAGR in 2018-2020 highlights the potential for significant drawdowns.
*   **MDD:** The MDD is consistently high, indicating that NVIDIA's stock price can experience large declines. Investors should be prepared for significant volatility.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has grown substantially.

*   **High Growth Expectation:**  The extremely high expected return suggests significant growth potential is anticipated.
