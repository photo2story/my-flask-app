**1. Return Rate Comparison and Analysis:**

*   **Ticker:** SUI-USD
*   **Company Name:** Sui
*   **Overview (1 line):** Sui is a relatively new Layer 1 blockchain and cryptocurrency.

**Return Comparison:**

*   SUI has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return of -82.03% is dramatically lower than VOO's 19.41%.

**Divergence Analysis:**

*   **Current Divergence:** -101.4. This means that SUI's performance is significantly lagging the S&P 500.
*   **Relative Divergence: 4.9.** This indicates that the current divergence is near the *bottom* of its historical range, meaning that the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is as bad as it has been in the recent past.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR      | MDD      | Alpha     | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|----------|-----------|------|--------|
| 2023-2025  | -82.0%    | 95.2%    | -99.0%    | 0.0  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:** A very poor -82.0% Compound Annual Growth Rate indicates significant losses over the period.
*   **MDD:**  A 95.2% Maximum Drawdown indicates very high volatility and substantial risk of large losses.
*   **Alpha:** A -99.0% Alpha suggests SUI is performing significantly worse than would be expected based on the market's performance. In other words, it's underperforming even considering market conditions.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of 0.0 is unusual and needs to be scrutinized; it means SUI has no correlation to the market, which is unlikely.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close Price:** 0.0003001941
*   **Last-market:** No change from previous close.
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.0003
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.0003
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.0004

*   **Analysis:** The SMAs suggest a very slight downward trend. The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are identical, while the 60-day SMA is slightly higher. This means that recent prices have been slightly lower than the average of the last 60 days. The lack of change in the last market close suggests stability at a very low level.

**3. Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (0.7):** Indicates *Medium Investment* is recommended based on this one Market Risk Indicator alone; however, other factors suggest more caution.
*   **RSI (42.71):** This is neutral, not oversold (below 30) nor overbought (above 70).
*   **PPO (-1.36):** This negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (10 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70):** This is a very weak buy signal, highlighting caution due to the MRI. The very small share purchase recommendation reflects the high risk.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change: 0.7 (+):** Indicates a short-term increase in relative divergence. This suggests that SUI's performance relative to the S&P 500 has slightly improved *recently*.
*   **Last-market:** Price at previous close:  The fact that there is no price change may suggest market illiquidity (or market manipulation).
*   **Expected Return (292.6%):** This is a highly optimistic projection *if* the investor holds for > 2 years.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Headlines:** Many headlines are negative, focusing on price decreases ("Sui tumbles," "One More Sell-off Could Send It Under $1").
*   **Volatility:** News items suggest significant price swings and volatility ("SUI/USD rebounds 50%").
*   **Price Predictions:** There are mixed opinions, with some analysts predicting breakouts while others foresee further declines ("SUI Price Prediction | Is SUI a Good Investment").

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

SUI-USD presents a very high-risk investment opportunity.

*   **Negative Performance:** The stark underperformance compared to the S&P 500, combined with a significant maximum drawdown and poor Alpha, highlights its weaknesses.
*   **SMA Trends:**  The SMAs indicate a very slight downward trend, with recent prices lower than the 60-day average.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The MRI suggests a medium investment level but, in general, the indicators are mixed. The RSI is neutral, the PPO suggests a potential downtrend, and the hybrid signal is a very weak buy recommendation.
*   **News Sentiment:** Recent news is generally negative, with concerns about further price declines and high volatility. However, there are also a few articles highlighting potential rebounds.
*   **Divergence:** The recent increase in relative divergence is a possible positive, but it's small and from a very low base.
*   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return should be treated with extreme caution. It is based on a long-term (2+ year) investment horizon and relies on SUI significantly outperforming the market, which is not supported by the current data or news.
*   **Recommendations:**

    *   **Avoid/Sell:** Based on the data, it would be not be recommended to hold SUI due to the dramatic negative performance and volatility.
    *   **Speculative Buy (Very Small Position):** If you believe in the long-term potential of Sui and are comfortable with extremely high risk, a very small, speculative position *might* be considered. However, this should be done with the understanding that you could lose most or all of your investment.
    *   **Monitor Closely:** If you choose to invest, actively monitor news, price movements, and technical indicators.
    *   **Set Stop-Loss Orders:** Due to the high volatility, consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses.
