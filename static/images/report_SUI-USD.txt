    *   Max: 147.5
    *   Min: -114.2
    *   Current: -101.4
    *   Relative Divergence: 4.9

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    | Year      | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
    | --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
    | 2022-2024 | -82.0%  | 95.2%   | -99.0%  | 1.2   | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Massive Underperformance:** SUI has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by over 100 percentage points cumulatively. This highlights a substantial divergence.
*   **High Volatility:** The wide divergence range (Max 147.5, Min -114.2) indicates extremely high volatility relative to the S&P 500. A relative divergence of 4.9 suggests that it's currently near the low end of its divergence range versus the S&P 500 (meaning the underperformance is close to its worst observed level).
*   **Concerning Metrics:** The negative CAGR (-82.0%) and high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 95.2% further emphasize the significant losses experienced by SUI investors during the analyzed period. The high MDD indicates the potential for substantial capital loss.
*   **Negative Alpha:** The very large negative Alpha (-99.0%) signifies that SUI has performed poorly relative to what would be expected based on its beta. In other words, it has underperformed its benchmark by a significant amount.
*   **Beta Above 1:** A beta of 1.2 suggests that SUI is more volatile than the overall market (S&P 500).  It tends to amplify market movements, both upward and downward.
*   **Cap:** A Cap of 0 likely means that the Sharpe Ratio couldn't be calculated, probably due to the extremely negative returns. A Sharpe Ratio is used to assess the returns adjusted for risk.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 0.0003001941076945
*   **Last-market:**
    *   Price: 0.0003001941

*   **5-day SMA:** 0.0003
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.0003
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.0004

**Analysis:**

*   **Stable recent pricing (very low):** The price is very small. The last traded price shows no change from the previous close.
*   **Short-term price stability:** The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are identical, indicating a period of price stability over the recent weeks.
*   **Slight downward trend:** The 60-day SMA being slightly higher than the 5-day and 20-day SMAs hints at a slight downward trend in the recent past. However, the overall values are so low that even small changes can appear significant.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 42.71
*   **PPO:** -1.36
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (10 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2024-05-27)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.7 (+): Short-term rise
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0 (No excess return expected compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **Medium Risk:** The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk, according to the provided scale.
*   **Neutral RSI:** An RSI of 42.71 is considered neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **Negative PPO:** A PPO of -1.36 suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downtrend, which aligns with the SMA observation in section 2.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is recommending a buy with caution due to the MRI of 0.7, indicating a relatively cautious signal.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The 20-day relative divergence change of 0.7 (+) suggests a recent improvement in SUI's performance relative to its comparison stock, but it's important to remember the *overall* divergence is still very negative.
*   **Zero Expected Return:** The expected return of 0.0% is very concerning. It suggests no anticipated outperformance compared to the S&P 500, making it a potentially unattractive investment, especially given the higher risk profile.
*   **Fluctuation Issue:** Since {'price': 0.0003001941, 'previousClose': 0.0003001941, 'change': 0.0} are constant, there are no fluctuations to consider, though any price change will make a big % change.
