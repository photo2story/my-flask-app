*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** -82.0% indicates a very significant loss over the observed period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 95.2% suggests extreme volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** -99.0% shows very substantial underperformance compared to the market, adjusting for risk.
*   **Beta:** 0.0 suggests that the price of Sui is uncorrelated with the overall market (S&P 500).  This could mean it's driven by its own specific factors.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment) - While not the riskiest, it still warrants caution.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (10 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2024-05-27) - This is a cautiously optimistic signal, suggesting using most of available cash to buy, but with a warning due to the MRI.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +0.7 (+): Short-term increase in divergence favoring Sui
*   **Expected Return (%):** 292.6 - This is a very high expected return over a long-term (2+ year) investment horizon, relative to the S&P 500, if one were to start investing now.

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests medium risk, RSI is neutral, and PPO indicates slight downward momentum. The Hybrid Signal advocates cautious buying. The recent increase in relative divergence is a short-term positive. The 'change' value being 0.0 indicates no price volatility to report. The extremely high expected return should be viewed with significant skepticism given the historical underperformance.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   The news items appear unrelated to SUI-USD.  They are general news headlines.  This suggests either a lack of specific news coverage or an issue with the data source.
*   The content of provided URLs is irrelevant.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   No analyst consensus or price targets are available.

**5. Overall Summary & Conclusion**

SUI-USD has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While there's been a slight recent uptick in its relative divergence, the overall picture is concerning: very negative CAGR, large drawdown, extremely negative alpha, and market risk indicator(MRI) is medium. Price action is flat, showing no immediate momentum.

The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a cautious buy, but the lack of relevant news and the significant underperformance raise red flags. The extremely high expected return should be regarded cautiously given the very high volatility.

**Recommendation:**

Given the substantial underperformance, high volatility, and lack of specific positive catalysts (particularly relevant news), **it would be very risky to invest in SUI-USD based solely on this information.** Further, more specific research, especially concerning relevant news, is strongly recommended before considering any investment. Be wary of the high expected return, as it's based on a potentially volatile asset.
