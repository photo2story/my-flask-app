**Comprehensive Analysis**

Considering the cumulative return of the review stock is significantly negative, and the S&P 500's is positive, the divergence is -80.40, which is lower than the minimum value of -109.80. This implies that the review stock's performance lags behind the S&P 500.

The alpha, beta analysis shows a high alpha (-79.0%) and zero beta, indicating an extremely high return relative to the market.

The 5-, 20-, and 60-day moving averages are all at $0.00, indicating a lack of short-term and long-term price direction.

The indicators show a risk level of medium with a market risk indicator of 0.70, and a hybrid signal of "Buy". The RSI and PPO values suggest weakness in the asset.

News has been largely positive in recent months, with headlines highlighting the potential for Sui to become a "Solana-killer" and spark significant price increases.
