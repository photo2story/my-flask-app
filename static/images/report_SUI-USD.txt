2026-01-06 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided SUI-USD (Sui) data, along with analysis:

**0) Overview & Disclaimers:**

*   All numbers are based on the provided data snippets.
*   This is NOT investment advice. Cryptocurrency is highly volatile.

**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **Sui Company Overview:**  Sui is a layer 1 blockchain designed for fast, secure, and scalable digital asset ownership.
*   **Sui Cumulative Return:** -82.03%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 18.48%
*   **Divergence:** -100.5 (Relative Divergence: 4.9)

**Analysis of Returns & Alpha/Beta:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:** Sui has drastically underperformed the S&P 500. The divergence of -100.5 indicates a substantial gap in returns. The relative divergence of 4.9 suggests this divergence is near the bottom end of its historical range.
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    | Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
    |------------|--------|-------|--------|------|--------|
    | 2022-2024  | -82.0% | 99.0% | -98.0% | 1.2  | 0.0    |

    *   **CAGR:** A Compound Annual Growth Rate of -82.0% is extremely poor.
    *   **MDD:** A Maximum Drawdown of 99.0% indicates enormous risk and volatility.  At one point, an investor would have lost virtually their entire investment.
    *   **Alpha:**  Alpha of -98.0% suggests Sui has significantly underperformed its benchmark (risk-adjusted).  It's not generating positive returns beyond what's explained by its risk (Beta).
    *   **Beta:** Beta of 1.2 indicates that Sui is 20% more volatile than the overall market (S&P 500). It tends to amplify market movements (both up and down).
    *   **Cap(B):** The value of 0.0 means that the capitalization of the subject is small, indicating high volatility.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 0.0003001941
*   **Previous Close:** 0.0003001941
*   **Change:** 0.0
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.0003
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.0003
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.0004

**Analysis of Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Flat Trend:** The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are nearly identical, suggesting a lack of significant short-term price movement. The 60-day SMA is slightly higher, indicating that longer-term trends are still slightly above the current price, but the difference is minimal.

**3) RSI, PPO, MRI, & Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 42.71
*   **PPO:** -1.36
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (10 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 0.7 (+) (단기상승 - Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 283.7%

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of risk. While not extremely risky, it's not the safest investment either.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 42.71 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), but isn't there yet. It suggests that the stock may be undervalued, but it's not a strong signal on its own.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of -1.36 indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, suggesting a potential downtrend, but a relatively small number.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests investing 80% of available cash, buying 10 shares, but cautions, noting the MRI. The system seems to be cautiously optimistic.
*   **Divergence Change:** A recent increase in relative divergence implies a short-term upward trend relative to the S&P 500, but the overall divergence is still very negative.
*   **Expected Return:** The 283.7% expected return is extremely high and should be treated with skepticism. It's likely based on a specific model and assumptions that may not hold true. Given the historical performance, this is a very optimistic outlook. The claim is that if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point, there is an expected excess return compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Fluctuation issue:** The price and previous close being the same while the change is 0.0 suggests no recent volatility.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed News:** The news headlines paint a mixed picture:
    *   **Price Predictions:** Articles from Cryptopolitan and Capital.com focus on price predictions, highlighting the speculative nature of the asset. "Is SUI a good investment?" is a common question, suggesting uncertainty.
    *   **Market Trends:** The Benzinga article discusses ETF inflows for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, indicating broader market trends in the crypto space.
    *   **Analysis & Volatility:** The Seeking Alpha article "Unravelling SUI Network" suggests an in-depth look at the technology and its potential. CoinDesk reports on a flash crash and extraordinary selling volume, highlighting volatility.
    *   **Market Pressure:** Yahoo Finance Australia attributes a price drop to a stronger US dollar, showing sensitivity to macroeconomic factors.

The absence of analyst consensus adds further uncertainty. The high volatility and unproven nature of the cryptocurrency make it a risky investment.
