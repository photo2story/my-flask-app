**0) Report Structure:**

*   **Numbers First:**  Present the raw data as provided.
*   **Simple Analysis:** Provide basic interpretations and observations based on the numbers.
*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** A summary, incorporating all the data and news.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** SUI-USD
*   **Company:** Sui (Overview: *Assuming Sui is a blockchain platform/cryptocurrency*.)
*   **Cumulative Return (SUI-USD):** -82.03%
*   **Cumulative Return (S&P 500/VOO):** +18.48%
*   **Divergence:** -101.4 (Max: 147.5, Min: -114.2, Relative Divergence: 4.9)

    *   **Analysis:** Sui has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The cumulative return is deeply negative. The divergence of -101.4 indicates a considerable performance gap. A relative divergence of 4.9 suggests that the divergence is near its lowest point in the observed range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------ |
| 2022-2024 | -82.0% | 99.9% | -98.0% | 1.2 | 0.0   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** -82.0% - A massive loss over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 99.9% -  An extremely high drawdown, indicating a huge loss from peak to trough. This implies a massive risk for investors.
*   **Alpha:** -98.0% -  Significantly negative alpha suggests substantial underperformance relative to its benchmark *after* accounting for risk (beta).
*   **Beta:** 1.2 - Indicates that SUI-USD is more volatile than the market (S&P 500). A beta greater than 1 means the price tends to move more than the market when the market moves up or down.
*   **Cap(B):** 0.0 - This likely indicates the market capitalization is very low or negligible compared to billions.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 0.0003001941076945
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 0.0003001941, 'previousClose': 0.0003001941, 'change': 0.0}
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.0003
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.0003
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.0004

    *   **Analysis:** The price is extremely low. The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are the same, indicating little short-term price movement. The 60-day SMA is slightly higher, suggesting a possible slightly higher average price in the recent past.  The 'change' being 0.0 suggests no movement in the last session, reflecting stability, or a complete lack of liquidity.

**3) Indicators Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 42.71
*   **PPO:** -1.36
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (10 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2024-05-27)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.7 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0
    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **MRI (0.7):** Suggests medium investment risk, but the very low price and other indicators need to be considered.
        *   **RSI (42.71):** Indicates that SUI-USD is neither overbought nor oversold, sitting near a neutral level.
        *   **PPO (-1.36):** Indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, which can signal a downtrend or consolidation.
        *   **Hybrid Signal:**  The "buy" signal is tempered with "caution" and a low MRI weighting, reflecting the mixed signals. The very low number of shares (10) suggests high risk. The system advises to buy a small amount using 80% of the remaining cash, indicating a risky situation, especially with 0% cash position.
        *   **Relative Divergence Change:** The short-term rise is a positive signal, but should be considered with other data.
        *   **Expected Return:** 0.0% is a significant warning.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news articles are all dated in the future (2025). This suggests an error in the data provided or that these are predictions rather than past news events.
*   The headlines themselves are a mix of optimistic and cautious, but generally indicate speculation and volatility. They cover price predictions, potential rallies, and the announcement of stablecoins on the Sui blockchain.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   Analyst Consensus data is missing, which is a significant gap.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

SUI-USD presents a picture of a very high-risk investment.

*   **Negative Performance:** The asset has experienced a dramatic loss in value (-82.03% cumulative return) and has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **High Volatility & Risk:** The high beta (1.2) and maximum drawdown (99.9%) confirm that this is a volatile and risky asset. The negative alpha indicates that this underperformance is risk-adjusted.
*   **Low Price & Stagnation:** The extremely low price and lack of recent price movement suggest a struggling asset.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The MRI indicates medium risk, but other signals are not aligned. The Hybrid Signal indicates a speculative buy opportunity, but with a very small allocation and cautions due to the low price.
*   **Future News (Incorrectly Dated):** The "future" news indicates that there's still some optimism and speculation surrounding SUI, but the date errors cast doubt on the reliability of this information.
*   **Missing Data:** The absence of analyst consensus data makes it difficult to gauge professional sentiment.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, SUI-USD appears to be a highly speculative and risky investment. The extremely negative performance, high volatility, and lack of significant positive signals warrant extreme caution. A potential investor should perform thorough due diligence and consider their own risk tolerance. Further research is necessary to understand the true potential of the platform, but based on this data alone, it's not a recommended investment. The incorrectly dated news headlines raise a red flag regarding the data's accuracy and reliability.
