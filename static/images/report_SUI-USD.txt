2025-12-03 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down this analysis of SUI-USD.

**0. Overview and Instructions Adherence:** The following report aims to address each prompt point, providing numerical data first, followed by a simple analysis.

**1. Return Rate Comparison and Divergence:**

*   **Ticker:** SUI-USD (Sui)
*   **Company Overview:** Sui is a layer 1 blockchain designed for fast, secure, and scalable decentralized applications.
*   **Cumulative Return (SUI-USD):** -82.03%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 19.41%
*   **Divergence:** -101.4 (Max: 147.5, Min: -114.2, Relative Divergence: 4.9)

**Analysis:**

Sui has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return of -82.03% is drastically lower than VOO's 19.41%. The divergence of -101.4 indicates a considerable difference in performance. The relative divergence of 4.9 suggests that, compared to its own historical range of divergence with VOO, it's currently near the *bottom* of that range, but this doesn't imply any future performance.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
| :---------- | :----- | :----- | :------ | :--- | :----- |
| 2023-2025 | -82.0% | 95.2% | -99.0% | 0.0  | 0.0  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** A staggering -82.0% CAGR indicates a heavy loss over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The 95.2% MDD signifies a very high level of risk and volatility. Investors saw a significant portion of their investment wiped out at some point.
*   **Alpha:** -99.0%. Negative alpha implies that SUI underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Beta is 0.0, this indicates the price of SUI is not correlated with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** The 0.0 might indicate that the information isn't available.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 0.0003001941
*   **Previous Close:** 0.0003001941
*   **Change:** 0.0
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.0003
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.0003
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.0004

**Analysis:**

The price has been relatively stable in the very short term (5 & 20 days), but trending downward slightly longer term (60 days) given that the 60-day SMA is slightly higher than the shorter SMAs.  The 'change' being 0.0 implies no movement in the most recent trading session.

**3. Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 42.71
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.36
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (10 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2024-05-27)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** 0.7 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 292.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment rating is somewhat incongruous with the negative performance discussed in part 1, so may require more caution.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 42.71 indicates the asset is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is recommending a *partial* buy, but with caution, referencing the MRI. This is interesting, considering the other negative signals.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The increase in relative divergence over the past 20 days does suggest a short-term upward trend *relative* to VOO.  This doesn't mean SUI is necessarily increasing in price, just that it is not decreasing *as quickly* as VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return of 292.6% should be viewed with *extreme* skepticism. This implies a very high degree of risk and is not a guarantee of future performance. It is likely based on a model that projects a very significant recovery.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Bitcoin Correlation:** The news about Bitcoin's rebound and crypto-tied stocks climbing suggests SUI could be affected by broader cryptocurrency market trends.
*   **Bullish Sentiment vs. Decline:** Headlines presenting contrasting viewpoints ("Going to Send Bulls to the Moon?" vs. "Large cryptocurrencies fall as Sui declines") highlight the volatility and uncertainty surrounding SUI.
*   **Technical Analysis & Resistance:** Articles focusing on resistance levels (e.g., "$2.92 resistance wall") suggest technical analysis is being used to gauge potential price movements.
*   **General Information:** Articles like "What is SUI crypto, and how do you trade it?" indicate ongoing interest and education efforts surrounding the cryptocurrency.
*   **Support Levels:** Mentions of support levels (e.g., "$3.40") suggest attempts to identify potential price floors.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Sui (SUI-USD) has experienced a very significant decline in value, underperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin. Its high MDD and negative CAGR reflect substantial risk and volatility.  Recent news articles present a mixed picture, with some suggesting potential for recovery and others highlighting continued challenges. While the MRI suggests a medium investment risk, this assessment should be tempered by the cryptocurrency's negative performance indicators and inherent market volatility. The hybrid signal's cautious buy recommendation is more balanced than a full buy recommendation, reflecting the counterbalancing of bullish and bearish indicators. **The extremely high expected return should be considered highly speculative.** Short-term, there may be some positive divergence *relative* to the S&P 500, but this is far from a guarantee of long-term success. Given the data, investing in SUI would be a high-risk, high-reward proposition. Further research and a thorough understanding of the cryptocurrency market are crucial before making any investment decisions. Without analyst consensus and targets, assessing external validation of the asset is not possible.
