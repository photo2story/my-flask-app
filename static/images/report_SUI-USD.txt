**0) Report Structure**

First, the core data is presented plainly. Then, analysis and context are added.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (SUI-USD vs. VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** SUI-USD
*   **Company Name:** Sui
*   **Overview:** Sui is a layer 1 blockchain designed to enable creators and developers to build experiences that cater to the next billion users in web3.
*   **SUI Cumulative Return:** -82.03%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 19.41%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Maximum: 147.5
    *   Minimum: -114.2
    *   Current: -101.4
    *   Relative Divergence: 4.9

*   **Analysis:**  SUI has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.  The current divergence is -101.4, meaning SUI is lagging the S&P 500 by a substantial margin. The relative divergence of 4.9 indicates that SUI's current divergence from VOO is near the bottom of its historical range, suggesting it is performing poorly relative to the comparison.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | -82.0% | 95.2% | -99.0% | 0.0  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** -82.0% - This confirms the very poor investment return over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 95.2% - This represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period, indicating very high risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** -99.0% - A negative alpha signifies that the investment has underperformed its benchmark index on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** 0.0 - Beta measures the volatility of an investment compared to the market. A beta of 0.0 suggests that SUI's price movements are not correlated with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** 0.0 - Likely Market Cap in Billions. This could indicate it's either very small or not applicable in this context.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 0.0003001941076945
*   **Last Market:**
    *   Price: 0.0003001941
    *   Previous Close: 0.0003001941
    *   Change: 0.0
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.0003
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.0003
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.0004

*   **Analysis:** The price is relatively stable in the very short term (change of 0.0). The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are the same, indicating no significant recent trend.  The 60-day SMA is slightly higher, which might suggest a longer-term downtrend, but the values are so close that the impact is minor. The price is essentially flat in recent trading.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 42.71
*   **PPO:** -1.36
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (10 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2024-05-27)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.7 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 292.6%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk, but it's on the lower end of the "medium" range, indicating caution is warranted.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 42.71 is approaching oversold territory, but is not there yet. This suggests the asset is neither overbought nor oversold.
    *   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a downtrend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal indicates a "Buy" recommendation, but with caution due to the MRI. The system suggests using 80% of available cash to buy 10 shares.
    *   **Relative Divergence Change:** A positive change indicates SUI has slightly outperformed its comparison in the last 20 days, suggesting a short-term upward trend.
    *   **Expected Return:** A very high expected return (292.6%) should be viewed with extreme skepticism. Such high returns are unlikely to be sustainable and often indicate very high risk.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Key Headlines (Summarized):**
    *   "SUI USD Going To Send Bulls To The Moon? Yes, No, Maybe?" (Repeated) - This headline is speculative and offers no concrete information.
    *   "Sui Price Prediction | Is SUI a Good Investment" - This suggests uncertainty about the investment potential.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

SUI-USD has performed very poorly compared to the S&P 500, with a large negative cumulative return and a significant maximum drawdown. Technical indicators show a slightly improving short-term trend, but the longer-term picture is still weak. The MRI suggests medium risk, but with a cautionary note.

The news flow is mixed, with hype-driven articles alongside more substantive pieces. The potential acquisition interest from Lion Group is a notable positive factor.

**Overall, SUI-USD appears to be a high-risk, high-reward investment.** While there are some signs of short-term improvement and potential acquisition interest, the historical performance and high volatility suggest caution is warranted. The exceptionally high "expected return" should be viewed with considerable skepticism.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions. Lack of analyst consensus limits a deeper understanding.
