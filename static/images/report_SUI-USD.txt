**1) Comparative Return Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** SUI-USD
*   **Company:** Sui
*   **Overview:** Sui is a layer-1 blockchain designed for fast and secure decentralized applications.
*   **Return Comparison:** SUI-USD has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period. The cumulative return of SUI-USD is -82.03% compared to the S&P 500's 19.41%.
*   **Divergence:** The divergence of -101.4 indicates a substantial difference in performance. The relative divergence of 4.9 suggests that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

The table provides a stark picture of SUI's performance.

*   **CAGR of -82.0%:** Represents an extremely significant loss over the period 2023-2025.
*   **MDD of 95.2%:** A massive Maximum Drawdown indicates a very volatile and risky investment.
*   **Alpha of -99.0%:** Demonstrates that SUI has significantly underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis. This means the investment has generated substantially lower returns than expected for the risk taken.
*   **Beta of 0.0:** Indicates that SUI has virtually no correlation with the overall market (S&P 500 in this case).
*   **Cap(B) of 0.0:** This metric depends on the context of "Cap" but without definition, it's difficult to offer valuable insights.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 0.0003
*   **Moving Averages:** The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are both at 0.0003, while the 60-day SMA is slightly higher at 0.0004. This suggests the price is relatively stable in the very short term, but still below the longer-term average.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** A value of 0.7 suggests "Medium Investment Recommended." However, it's important to note that relying solely on the MRI can be misleading without considering other indicators and fundamental analysis.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 42.71 is close to the oversold territory (below 30). While not definitively oversold, it suggests that the stock *may* be undervalued and could potentially experience a price increase.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of -1.36 indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, suggesting a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (10 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70)" signal suggests a cautious buy signal, allocating 80% of available cash into 10 shares while highlighting caution due to the MRI.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** A positive change of 0.7 indicates a short-term upward trend, which aligns with potential rebound based on recent movements.
*   **Expected Return:** A high expected return of 292.6% should be viewed skeptically. It may be based on a specific model, but very high expected returns are often unrealistic and should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

The news headlines present a mixed picture:

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Several articles point to price decreases ("Most large cryptocurrencies decrease as Sui tumbles").
*   **Price Predictions:** Some articles explore price predictions, which are speculative. The Cryptopolitan article on SUI price prediction to 2025-2031 asks "Is SUI a good investment?" - that it even needs to be asked is not a great sign.
*   **Market Context:** News about Bitcoin rebounds and crypto-tied stocks climbing suggests a broader market trend, but SUI's performance still needs to be evaluated independently.
*   **Potential Rebound:** The FXStreet article ("SUI/USD rebounds 50%") highlights a potential positive movement, but also identifies a resistance level that needs to be overcome.
*   **General Information:** Articles like "What is SUI crypto, and how do you trade it?" provide background information but don't necessarily indicate future performance.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** The Yahoo Finance Singapore article ("SUI Soars 15% as Analysts Predict Breakout to as High as $10") presents a very optimistic outlook from some analysts, but such predictions should be taken with a grain of salt.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Based on the data, the following conclusions can be drawn about SUI-USD:

*   **Poor Historical Performance:** SUI-USD has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The negative CAGR and massive drawdown are serious concerns.
*   **High Risk:** The high volatility and negative alpha indicate a risky investment.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The technical indicators are giving mixed signals. The RSI suggests a potential for a rebound, while the PPO indicates a downtrend. The MRI suggests a medium investment risk, but this should be interpreted cautiously.
*   **News Sentiment:** The news headlines are mixed, with some articles highlighting price decreases and others suggesting potential for a rebound. Analyst opinions are also varied, with some being very optimistic and others more cautious.
*   **Important Considerations:**
    *   **Speculative Nature:** Cryptocurrencies are inherently speculative investments.
    *   **Limited Data:** The provided data is limited in scope. A longer historical period and more detailed fundamental analysis would be needed for a more informed decision.
    *   **High Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return should be treated with skepticism.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the information provided, investing in SUI-USD appears to be **high-risk**. While there are some signs of a potential short-term rebound, the poor historical performance and negative news headlines suggest caution. **Before investing in SUI-USD, it is crucial to conduct thorough research, consider your risk tolerance, and potentially consult with a financial advisor.** The large expected return should not be the primary motivator for investment due to the historical performance of SUI, especially in contrast to benchmark indices.
