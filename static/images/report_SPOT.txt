| 2023-2025  | 126.0% | 72.4% | 115.0% | -0.1 | 115.3 |

Analysis:  The CAGR shows significant volatility, with periods of strong growth followed by substantial declines.  Beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.  Alpha is generally negative except for a few periods, suggesting underperformance relative to the market adjusted for risk (beta).  Market capitalization shows substantial growth over time.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $563.07
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $556.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $562.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $573.77

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  The recent closing price shows a -1.63% change from the previous close indicating a downward movement.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.4 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.34 (Positive, but relatively low)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +0.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -13.2% (Negative expected return, although this is short term and long-term projections are described below)

The indicators paint a mixed picture.  The negative price change and below-average moving averages suggest bearish momentum, while the approaching oversold RSI and positive PPO offer potential for a rebound.  The positive relative divergence suggests that the recent price decline may be less severe than previous ones.  The negative expected return indicates short-term concerns but needs to be contextualized within the long term.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS      | 예상 EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.88     | 2.06     | -0.18       |
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61     | 1.88     | -0.27       |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33     | 1.06     | +0.27       |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.97     | 0.65     | +0.32       |
| 2024-02-06 | -0.39    | -0.08    | -0.31       |

Analysis:  Recent EPS has consistently fallen short of expectations, except for the last two quarters where it exceeded expectations. This suggests some volatility in earnings performance.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is steadily increasing, showing consistent growth quarter-over-quarter. Profit margins are also healthy and showing a positive trend, indicating improvements in profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity is increasing, reflecting improved financial health. ROE was negative in 2023-12-31, but improved significantly in subsequent quarters indicating stronger profitability and efficiency in the use of shareholder's equity.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

SPOT's long-term historical performance significantly outpaces the S&P 500, indicated by its high cumulative return and strong relative ranking. However, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend. Technical indicators present a mixed signal. While recent earnings have been mixed in relation to expectations, revenue and profitability are generally increasing.  The substantial volatility in CAGR and beta underscores the inherent risk associated with SPOT.  The -13.2% expected return should be viewed cautiously as a short-term projection, and a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy, perhaps incorporating dollar-cost averaging, should be considered in light of the historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for the earnings misses and the fluctuating beta is warranted before making any investment decisions.
