*   **CAGR:** Shows the compounded annual growth rate over specific periods. It is extremely high in recent periods, but negative in others.
*   **MDD:** Represents the Maximum Drawdown, indicating the largest peak-to-trough decline. High MDD figures suggest significant risk.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the excess return compared to the benchmark (S&P 500) after accounting for risk (Beta).  Negative alpha indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis (especially in the 2019-2023 period). The most recent periods show very strong positive alpha.
*   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A Beta above 1 indicates that the stock is more volatile than the S&P 500, as it is throughout all of the periods shown.
*   **Cap(B):** Is an indication of the company's capitalization tier (likely a rough estimate of market cap), in Billions of dollars.
*   **Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a volatile history.  SPOT's high Beta indicates it's significantly more volatile than the S&P 500. The Alpha figures are especially concerning, reflecting the stock's ability to generate excess returns. Strong positive Alpha in the most recent period (2022-2025) suggests that the period of underperformance is coming to an end.

*   **Current Close:** 553.68

*   **Change:** -2.58%

*   **20-day SMA:** 580.27
*   **60-day SMA:** 611.61
*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), suggesting a short-term downward trend. The negative change on the last market day reinforces this.

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -1.3 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -11.0% (Negative long-term expected return compared to S&P 500).
*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.  The RSI is neutral. The PPO indicates a slight downward momentum. However, the hybrid signal offers a cautiously optimistic outlook. The expected return of -11.0% is concerning, indicating potential underperformance relative to the S\&P 500 over the long term.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative:** UBS has lowered expectations for Spotify's stock price. A UK outcry on a murder-rap test moderations. UBS lowers price target to $800.

*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 742.05 / 892.04 / 496.22
*   **Analysis:** Despite the UBS downgrade, the overall analyst consensus remains positive. The average target price suggests significant upside potential.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Spotify's stock presents a mixed picture. On one hand, it has significantly outperformed the S\&P 500 historically. Analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy" rating, and the average price target indicates substantial upside.

However, there are significant concerns:

*   **Volatility:** The high Beta and large MDD in the Alpha/Beta analysis highlight the stock's inherent volatility.
*   **Recent Underperformance:** While recent Alpha is strong, the previous years showed significant underperformance, and the negative expected return is concerning.
*   **Short-Term Downtrend:** The stock price is below its short and medium-term moving averages, suggesting a current downward trend.
*   **Mixed News:** The news flow is not uniformly positive, with a recent price target reduction from UBS.

**Conclusion:**

Spotify presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The company has strong growth potential and analyst support, but its historical volatility and recent underperformance cannot be ignored. Investors should carefully weigh their risk tolerance and investment horizon before considering a position in SPOT. The negative expected return suggests that careful monitoring and active management are essential. The latest news from UBS could mark the beginning of a change in analyst attitudes.
