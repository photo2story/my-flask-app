**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This information is not provided in the initial prompt and needs to be gathered from external sources.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown a significantly higher cumulative return than the S&P 500, but with considerable volatility. While recent earnings have shown improvement and revenue growth is consistent, the high volatility and the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns. The technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold market, but bearish momentum is present. Further investigation into recent news, analyst opinions, and a deeper dive into the methodology behind the -15.2% expected return are crucial before making any investment decisions. The substantial year-to-year fluctuations in CAGR and the negative alpha values in certain years highlight significant risk.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in SPOT.
