**Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|--------|--------|

| 2020-2022  | -56.0%  | 79.0%  | -55.0%  | -0.0   | 16.3   |

| 2023-2025  | 131.0%  | 78.3%  | 65.0%   | -0.2   | 119.9  |

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR has fluctuated significantly over different periods, ranging from -56% to a high of 131%.  This indicates high volatility in Spotify's growth. The recent years (2022-2025 and 2023-2025) show very strong growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is consistently high, around 78-79%.  This points to substantial risk and potential for significant losses in investment value.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, representing excess return compared to a benchmark, is highly variable. It was negative from 2019-2023, indicating underperformance relative to a benchmark, but very positive in the most recent periods, reflecting strong outperformance.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is consistently near zero (or negative), suggesting a very low correlation with the overall market.  This is unusual and could be due to the chosen benchmark or other factors.  A Beta near zero means Spotify's price movements are largely independent of the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Shows a generally upward trend in capitalization over time.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 582.16
*   **Previous Close:** 563.82

*   **5-day SMA:** 573.686
*   **20-day SMA:** 580.624
*   **60-day SMA:** 634.3857

**Analysis of Price Fluctuations:**

*   The stock price experienced a notable increase (3.25%).
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a possible short-term upward trend after a longer period of decline. However, the price is currently near the 20-day SMA, suggesting it is in the middle of a period of volatility.

**3) RSI, PPO Index Indicators, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 52.03 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.29 (Positive - indicating a slight upward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.4 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -16.1% (Long-term negative expected return compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI is neutral, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   The PPO is slightly positive, suggesting a short-term upward trend in price momentum.
*   The negative change in recent divergence indicates a short-term decline in relative performance.
