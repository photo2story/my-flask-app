**6. News and Recent Issues:**  This section requires further information from recent news sources to provide accurate analysis.  News related to earnings announcements, market outlook, and analyst opinions should be included for a complete analysis.


**7. Overall Summary:**

Spotify shows strong revenue and profit margin growth, but its recent earnings missed expectations, and the long-term expected return is negative against the S&P 500.  While recent price action shows short-term positive momentum, the negative PPO and the large swings in historical CAGR and MDD reveal substantial volatility and risk. The considerable outperformance versus the S&P 500 over the given period is significant but may not be indicative of future performance. Further investigation into recent news and analyst sentiment is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The -14.3% expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a particularly important concern for long-term investors.
