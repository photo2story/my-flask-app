* **Closing Price:** $476.96
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $477.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $440.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $391.26

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively large gap between the 5-day and 60-day averages highlights recent price momentum.

* **RSI:** 78.29 (Overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.16 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** NaN (-)  Indicates a recent downward trend in relative strength. However, the absence of a value (NaN) makes this conclusion uncertain.  More data is needed for a reliable interpretation.
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -21.9%  This suggests a potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a two-year timeframe, despite recent strong returns.  This underscores the need for further investigation to understand the basis of the prediction.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown impressive growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in recent times.  However, the significant volatility and relatively high RSI indicate a potentially overbought condition. The recent EPS miss, although preceded by beats, and the projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns.  Further investigation into the specific reasons behind the projected underperformance (-21.9%), as well as analysis of recent news and analyst sentiment, are crucial for making an informed investment decision.  The strong financial indicators suggest a healthy financial base for the company.  The situation warrants a careful assessment of the risk-reward profile before taking any investment action.
