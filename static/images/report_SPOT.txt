    *   Bullish analyst sentiment with high price targets.
    *   Positive news coverage, with articles highlighting its position in the S&P 500.

*   **Negatives:**
    *   High volatility and significant maximum drawdowns.
    *   A negative "Expected Return," indicating potential underperformance versus the S&P 500 over the long term.
    *   Recent relative divergence indicating short-term weakness.
    *   The 60-day SMA represents resistance, which may need to be overcome to continue the upward trajectory.

**Conclusion:**

Spotify is a high-growth, high-volatility stock. Recent performance and analyst sentiment are positive, but the negative expected return and historical volatility warrant caution. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in SPOT. The recent pullback discussed in news articles might present an entry point for some, but the potential for significant drawdowns should not be ignored. A buy-and-hold strategy might not be advisable, and more active management might be required to capture the upside while mitigating the downside risk. The neutral MRI suggests a moderately risky investment.
