Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider.  As of the last data point, SPOT's cumulative return is 189.05%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 104.46%.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high alpha (significantly outperforming the market) and high beta (higher volatility than the market) across the observed periods.  However, the CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) vary considerably, indicating periods of strong growth and substantial risk. Note that a high Beta indicates higher volatility and risk.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2018-2020  | 28.3% | 32.4% | 1.9   | 1.9   | 63.6   |
| 2019-2021  | 27.2% | 38.9% | 1.2   | 2.1   | 47.3   |
| 2020-2022  | -19.5% | 71.1% | -26.9% | 2.2   | 16.0   |
| 2021-2023  | -15.5% | 71.1% | -26.0% | 2.9   | 38.0   |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $475.24 (Last Market: $475.09)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $475.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $436.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $388.79

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend, although the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average hints at recent consolidation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (78.14):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (0.37):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+19.0):**  Shows a recent strong upward move.
* **Expected Return (-22.2%):** This negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 suggests that despite past outperformance, future returns may lag the broader market over a 2-year timeframe.  This should be considered alongside other factors. The last closing price of $475.09 doesn't reflect an extreme event (no significant sudden jump or drop).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data reveals some volatility. While recent quarters (2024-Q3 and 2024-Q2) showed EPS exceeding expectations, earlier quarters showed significant misses.  Consistent revenue growth is observed across the quarters, but the profitability (EPS) is inconsistent.

| Date       | EPS   | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61  | 1.88        | Miss      |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33  | 1.06        | Beat      |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.97  | 0.65        | Beat      |
| 2024-02-06 | -0.39 | -0.08       | Miss      |
| 2023-10-24 | 0.33  | -0.22       | Beat      |

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires access to recent news sources (within the last two days) to provide information on earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions.  Please provide relevant news articles or links for a complete analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, the recent indicators (overbought RSI, negative expected return) suggest caution.  The company shows consistent revenue growth and improving profit margins, but EPS volatility and the negative ROE in Q4 2023 raise concerns. Further investigation into recent news and analyst sentiment is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high beta indicates a riskier investment compared to the broader market.  The high alpha suggests the potential for higher returns, but this comes at the price of much higher volatility and risk.
