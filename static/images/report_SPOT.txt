**Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:**

*   **CAGR:** Highly volatile. Spotify's annual growth rates fluctuate significantly, indicating sensitivity to market conditions and business cycles.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown (around 78-79%) indicates substantial risk and price volatility. This suggests that investors should be prepared for significant short-term losses.
*   **Alpha:** Varies significantly, reflecting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. Recent years show strong positive alpha, suggesting good stock-picking ability.
*   **Beta:** Consistently negative, but very close to 0.0. This suggests that Spotify's price movements are not highly correlated with the overall market, providing diversification benefits. The negative beta further suggests an inverse relationship.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization fluctuates, reflecting the company's changing valuation over time. The recent increase suggests renewed investor confidence.
