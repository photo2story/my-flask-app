| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown remarkable growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However,  the extremely high RSI, negative expected return, and recent earnings misses raise concerns about potential overvaluation and short-term risk.  While long-term growth potential is indicated by increasing revenue and profitability,  investors should exercise caution due to the current overbought conditions and the relatively high volatility reflected in the Beta.  Further analysis is needed before making a definitive investment decision.  Consider monitoring key metrics like RSI, earnings reports, and market sentiment before investing.
