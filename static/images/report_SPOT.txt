**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $482.52 (Last Market: $482.26)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $494.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $471.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $407.34

The price is currently below the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent downward pressure. However, it's above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term support level.  The relatively large gap between the 5-day and 20/60-day averages suggests some volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 65.58 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.39 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -3.4% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -15.8% relative to S&P 500.  This suggests potential underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, despite past outperformance.  The large gap between current price and moving averages (particularly 5-day MA) might warrant caution.  Considering the closing price of $482.26 is relatively close to the last market price, there is no significant evidence of a rapid price movement (either upward or downward surge).
