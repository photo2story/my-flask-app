## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Spotify is a global audio streaming and media services provider.  The provided data shows significant outperformance against the S&P 500 (VOO), though recent performance has been volatile.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SPOT's cumulative return (211.60%) significantly exceeds that of the S&P 500 (87.03%).  The current divergence is 124.6%, placing it in the 78.8th percentile of historical divergence (max: 182.6, min: -91.5).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance relative to the market.  While positive alpha was observed in some periods (indicating outperformance), the most recent period (2021-2023) shows negative alpha (-0.2 and -0.3), suggesting underperformance.  Beta values vary considerably, reflecting changing market sensitivity.  This volatility highlights SPOT's sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The significant increase in the market cap (Cap(B)) over the periods suggests increasing market valuation, although this is not necessarily indicative of future growth.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $532.1
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $569.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $608.34
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $531.65

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend. The recent price change (-2.08%) indicates a short-term decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (23.4):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-2.35):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-14.6):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-17.1%):** This suggests a significant potential underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  The negative expected return coupled with the already negative recent price action is concerning.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|-------------|------------|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.88   | 2.06        | -0.18      |
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61   | 1.88        | -0.27      |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33   | 1.06        | +0.27      |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.97   | 0.65        | +0.32      |
| 2024-02-06 | -0.39  | -0.08       | -0.31      |

While recent quarters show positive surprises (EPS exceeding expectations), the trend indicates a decline in earnings, and the most recent results missed expectations.  This negatively impacts the stock's valuation and future growth prospects.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue is steadily growing, but profit margins are showing a slight decline, suggesting increasing costs or decreased efficiency.

**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has shown consistent growth except for a decrease in the period ending 2023-12-31, impacting ROE.  While ROE shows improvement from Q4 2023 to Q4 2024, the overall trend indicates a need for improvement in profitability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent performance shows concerning trends.  The stock is currently trading below its moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend. Negative PPO and low RSI indicate bearish momentum, while the negative expected return further reinforces this outlook. While recent revenue growth is positive, decreasing profit margins and a decline in EPS compared to expectations raise serious concerns about the companyâ€™s profitability and long-term sustainability. The significant negative price change and the oversold RSI might indicate a potential short-term bounce, but the fundamental indicators suggest a cautious approach. A long-term investment in SPOT, given the current data, is questionable due to its projected underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the declining profit margins and EPS is crucial before making any investment decisions.
