* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +6.1 (Short-term upward trend) - a short-term positive divergence, but needs confirmation.
* **Expected Return:** -11.3% – suggests a negative expected return compared to the S&P 500, but note that this is only an estimate of long-term (2+ years) relative performance and should not be taken as a definite prediction.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has demonstrated strong outperformance against the S&P 500, particularly in earlier periods.  However, recent performance has been weaker, and the high volatility necessitates careful consideration of risk.  Technical indicators paint a mixed picture, with some suggesting oversold conditions and potential upward movement, but overall indicators point to high risk and a bearish trend. While financial health appears strong with increasing revenue and profit margins, the negative expected return and high market risk suggest potential for further downside.  Further analysis is required to determine the long-term trajectory.  Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance before investing in SPOT.  The high volatility underscores the importance of diversification and a long-term investment horizon if participating in this stock.
