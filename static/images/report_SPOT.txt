## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Investment Report

This report analyzes Spotify Technology SA (SPOT), a leading global music streaming and podcast platform, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Spotify's cumulative return (190.03%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (99.32%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 90.7%, placing it in the 94.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong outperformance, although past performance is not indicative of future results. The provided Alpha values suggest that Spotify has consistently outperformed the market (positive alpha), particularly in the most recent period (2022-2024). However, the Beta values indicate significant market sensitivity, with periods of high correlation (high Beta) and periods of lower correlation (lower Beta).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $483.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $478.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $478.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $416.12

The price is currently trading above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.  However, it's considerably higher than its 60-day moving average, hinting at a recent rapid price increase.  Further investigation into the driving factors behind this recent price surge is warranted.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (54.48):** Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (-0.97):** A negative value suggests bearish momentum, potentially contradicting the positive short-term price movement. This discrepancy requires further investigation.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-4.2):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-14.6%):**  The negative expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern and requires further analysis to understand the underlying assumptions.  The large price increase recently might be a factor.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant variability in EPS:

* **Recent trend:**  A substantial improvement in EPS from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024. Notably, EPS significantly exceeded expectations in Q2 and Q3 2024.
* **Significant Changes:** The dramatic shift from a negative EPS in Q4 2023 to a positive and rising EPS in the subsequent quarters is notable.
* **Beats and Misses:**  Significant positive surprises in Q2 and Q3 2024 EPS.  Conversely, the Q4 2023 EPS was a significant miss.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue Growth:** Steady revenue growth is observed throughout the provided period, demonstrating consistent growth.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margin shows a consistent upward trend, indicating improved operational efficiency.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity has grown significantly, but ROE shows volatility, with a negative value in Q4 2023, highlighting potential financial challenges during that period.  Subsequent quarters show improved ROE.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

The provided data lacks information on recent news, market outlook, or analyst opinions. This critical information is needed for a complete investment assessment.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify's performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past, showing periods of high growth and market sensitivity.  Recent earnings have shown strong positive surprises, and revenue and profit margins are improving. However, the negative long-term expected return and the recent surge in price raise significant questions. The mixed signals from technical indicators (RSI and PPO) and the lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevent a definitive conclusion.  A comprehensive analysis requires additional data, including the recent earnings announcements, market outlook, and analyst sentiment. The sudden price jump also needs further investigation.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the information provided, a definitive buy, hold, or sell recommendation is impossible.  Further analysis focusing on recent news, market sentiment, and the factors contributing to the recent price surge is crucial before making any investment decision.  The significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 needs careful evaluation, considering the accompanying risks suggested by the Beta and the negative long-term expected return.  A thorough risk assessment is vital before investing in SPOT.
