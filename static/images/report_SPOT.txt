## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Investment Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) is a digital music, podcast, and video streaming service provider.  The cumulative return of SPOT is 188.93%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 103.18%.  The difference is 85.75%, placing it at the 98.75th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a strong relative performance over the period considered, but past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods, indicating fluctuating risk and excess return relative to the market.  While periods of high alpha (e.g., 2018-2020, 2022-2024) demonstrate outperformance, periods of negative alpha (2020-2022, 2021-2023) highlight periods of underperformance compared to the market. Beta values are generally above 1, suggesting higher volatility than the overall market.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2018-2020  | 111.2%   | 32.4%   | 63.8% | 0.8   | 63.6    |
| 2019-2021  | 105.8%   | 38.9%   | 5.7%  | 0.8   | 47.3    |
| 2020-2022  | -47.9%   | 71.1%   | -71.5%| 1.1   | 15.9    |
| 2021-2023  | -39.6%   | 71.1%   | -74.5%| 1.7   | 38.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 94.6%    | 62.8%   | 64.5% | 1.6   | 95.1    |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 475.04 (Last Market: 477.21)
* **5-day Moving Average:** 466.79
* **20-day Moving Average:** 422.90
* **60-day Moving Average:** 381.58

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend in the short to medium term. The relatively large gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average indicates a recent strong price increase.  The slight difference between the last market price and the closing price is negligible and does not signal any significant immediate price movement.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (83.88):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (1.01):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+25.16):** Shows a significant upward trend in relative strength over the past 20 days.

The combination of an overbought RSI and strong positive PPO suggests a potential short-term pullback is possible, despite the overall upward trend.  The 477.21 last market price, only slightly higher than the closing price, does not suggest a significant event like a sharp jump or drop.

**Expected Return (-0.02%):**  The negative expected return relative to the market suggests that while the stock has historically outperformed, future returns are projected to underperform the S&P 500 based on current modeling. This projection is for a long-term (2+ years) buy-and-hold strategy, and does not factor in near-term volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61    | 1.88          |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33    | 1.06          |

The most recent earnings (2024-11-12) show an EPS of 1.61, slightly below the expected EPS of 1.88. While recent quarters have shown improvements, the company's EPS has been volatile.  Consistent positive surprises are needed to sustain investor confidence.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify's strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500 is evident. However, recent earnings, while showing improvement, have not met expectations consistently, and the technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction.  The long-term outlook depends heavily on the company's ability to maintain revenue growth, improve profitability, and manage competition in the streaming market. A comprehensive analysis of recent news and analyst opinions will provide a more complete picture of the current market sentiment and future prospects.  The projected negative expected return against the S&P 500 suggests caution, especially for investors with a lower risk tolerance.  Further research into the reasons for negative ROE in Q4 2023 and volatility in EPS is required.
