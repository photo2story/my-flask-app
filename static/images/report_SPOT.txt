This report analyzes Spotify Technology SA (SPOT), a leading global music streaming service provider.  The analysis incorporates provided financial data, technical indicators, and comparative performance against the S&P 500 (VOO).


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference in cumulative returns, as of the last data point, is 122.5 percentage points (220.84% - 98.35% = 122.49%).  The relative divergence indicates SPOT's performance is at the 100th percentile relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500.  However, it's crucial to note that this high relative divergence doesn't guarantee future outperformance.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.  The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures showcase significant volatility, ranging from substantial gains to significant losses year-over-year, highlighting the inherent risk in SPOT investment.  The beta values suggest varying levels of correlation with the overall market.

**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profit margins show consistent growth, indicating a healthy financial position. However, the equity and ROE figures show some volatility, reflecting the company's growth trajectory and potential risk.  A negative ROE in Q4 2023 is a significant concern requiring deeper analysis.

**7. Summary of Analysis:**

Spotify shows strong growth in revenue and profit margins, indicating a healthy business model. However, the significant volatility in EPS, ROE, and CAGR highlights substantial risk. Technical indicators suggest an overbought condition, potentially indicating a short-term pullback.  The long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative (-10.5%).  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for high growth against the inherent risk before investing in SPOT.  Further due diligence is needed to understand the factors driving earnings volatility and the sustainability of the current growth trajectory.
