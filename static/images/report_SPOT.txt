## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify Technology SA is a Swedish-based audio streaming and media services provider.

The cumulative return of SPOT is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 128.1 percentage points. The relative divergence (using the provided min/max range) is 100%, indicating SPOT's performance is at the highest point relative to VOO within the historical data range.  However, this doesn't necessarily indicate future outperformance.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant volatility in SPOT's performance, varying from substantial gains to substantial losses year over year.  The high Beta values (generally above 0.1) indicate SPOT is more volatile than the overall market.  Alpha values are consistently around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance compared to the market's risk-adjusted returns, but this is not consistently positive.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates significantly, showing growth and shrinkage across the observed periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $550.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $528.83
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $487.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $467.38

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The recent price change of $2.09 (from previous close of $538.83) reflects a moderate increase.  


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 78.59.  This is in overbought territory (generally above 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.37.  A positive PPO indicates upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.8. This confirms short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** -10.4%.  This indicates that, at the current valuation, a long-term investment (2+ years) is expected to underperform the S&P 500 by 10.4%.  This negative outlook contrasts sharply with the past performance shown in point 1, highlighting the risk associated with this stock.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The EPS (Earnings Per Share) data shows a mixed picture. While there have been periods of exceeding expectations (e.g., Q2 and Q1 2024), there have also been instances of significant underperformance (e.g., Q4 2023).  Recent quarters show a positive trend of exceeding estimates.


| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|--------|--------------|------------|
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61   | 1.88         | Miss       |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33   | 1.06         | Beat       |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.97   | 0.65         | Beat       |
| 2024-02-06 | -0.39  | -0.08        | Miss       |
| 2023-10-24 | 0.33   | -0.22        | Beat       |


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is consistently increasing, indicating strong growth. Profit margins are also generally trending upwards, although there is some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown substantial growth, reflecting improved financial health. ROE (Return on Equity) shows volatility, with negative returns in Q4 2023 but strong positive returns in more recent quarters.  This indicates significant variability in the profitability of the company's equity.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify exhibits a high-growth profile with a history of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 in certain periods. However, its high volatility and significant price swings, along with the negative expected return relative to the market, highlight considerable risk. The recent earnings show a positive trend of beating expectations, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain. The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, and caution is warranted.


**8. Conclusion and Recommendation:**

SPOT's high growth potential and recent positive earnings trends are appealing.  However, the high volatility, negative long-term expected return relative to the market and high RSI suggest caution is necessary.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for significant returns against the substantial risk involved.  Further due diligence, including a thorough analysis of the company's competitive landscape and future growth prospects, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The current price might be considered overvalued based on the provided expected return, especially given the market volatility.  A more conservative approach might involve waiting for a potential pullback before considering an investment.
