**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown exceptional historical growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action and some negative indicators suggest a potential short-term downside risk. The company's financial health seems strong, with increasing revenue and generally improving profitability.  The negative expected return should be considered a short-term outlook.  A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) may still be attractive given historical outperformance relative to the broader market, but careful monitoring of earnings reports and market sentiment is crucial.  Further due diligence is necessary before making any investment decisions.
