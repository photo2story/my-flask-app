**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify's cumulative return (171.12%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (94.37%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 76.7%, placing it at the 87.5th percentile of its historical relative performance range (max: 100.8%, min: -91.5%).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $451.79
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $456.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $473.48
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $430.60

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The price is relatively close to the 60-day moving average, which might act as support.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (33.39):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-1.13):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):**  A -2.4% change indicates a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (-14.9%):**  This suggests a projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  The current price of $451.79, being below the moving averages, aligns with this negative expected return. There is no indication of a rapid price movement (either up or down) based on the provided data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data shows a mixed picture. While recent quarters (2024 Q2 and Q3) show positive EPS exceeding expectations, previous quarters displayed some misses.  Specifically:

* **Q3 2024:** EPS beat expectations ($1.61 vs $1.88).
* **Q2 2024:** EPS exceeded expectations ($1.33 vs $1.06).
* **Q1 2024:** EPS beat expectations ($0.97 vs $0.65).
* **Q4 2023:** EPS beat expectations (-$0.39 vs -$0.08).

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue shows consistent growth quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating solid underlying business performance.
* **Profitability:** Profit margins have increased steadily over the past year, indicating improved efficiency and cost management.
* **Equity and ROE:** Equity has grown significantly, and ROE is positive in the latest two quarters, suggesting improved profitability and financial health. However, a negative ROE in Q4 2023 should be investigated further for context.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**  No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided in the data.  Therefore, no market outlook based on news can be offered.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term decline. While recent earnings have largely exceeded expectations and financial health indicators are generally positive, the long-term expected return is projected to be negative relative to the S&P 500.  The lack of recent news or analyst opinions limits the scope of the analysis.  Further investigation into the Q4 2023 negative ROE is recommended.  The current oversold condition (RSI) may present a buying opportunity for some investors with a higher risk tolerance, but a cautious approach is advised considering the negative expected return.  More data (particularly revenue growth numbers and detailed financial statements) is needed for a more comprehensive assessment.
