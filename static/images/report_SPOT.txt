**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different time periods, indicating volatility in the stock's performance relative to the market. While alpha is consistently positive (indicating outperformance), the magnitude fluctuates widely, especially the negative CAGR in 2020-2023.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $404.93

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend, although the relatively small difference between the 5-day and closing price suggests a recent pause.

* **Relative Divergence:** Shows a short-term uptrend based on the last 20 days.
* **Expected Return (-15.7%):**  This suggests a negative expected return relative to the market over a long-term (2+ years) horizon, potentially implying that the current valuation is overinflated or that the market does not expect significant long-term outperformance. 
* **Last Market (498.92):**  The slight difference between the closing price and the last market price is negligible and does not suggest a sharp upward or downward movement.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT's performance has been volatile, with periods of significant outperformance followed by periods of underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While recent financial reports show increased revenue and profit margins, along with considerable increases in equity, the high RSI and negative PPO signal potential for a price correction. The negative expected return over the long term is also a concern.  The EPS performance is inconsistent.  A thorough analysis of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a complete investment decision.  The high relative outperformance compared to the S&P 500 observed in the past needs to be considered in conjunction with the apparent overbought condition, recent negative price momentum, and negative expected return.  A cautious approach is warranted.
