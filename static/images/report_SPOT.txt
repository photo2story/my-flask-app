## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) is a digital music, podcast, and video streaming service provider.

The cumulative return for SPOT is 203.94%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 52.12%.  The difference is 151.8%, placing it at the 100th percentile of the historical relative divergence range (max: 151.8, min: -61.2).  This indicates SPOT's performance has historically been substantially higher than the S&P 500. However, this high relative performance should be viewed cautiously, considering it is based on past performance, and the future is unlikely to mirror the past.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD (%) | Alpha (%) | Beta  | Cap (B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-----------|-------|---------|
| 2020-2022  | -55.0%   | 31.2%   | -53.0%    | 1.0   | 15.9    |
| 2021-2023  | -75.0%   | 31.2%   | -84.0%    | 1.0   | 38.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 158.0%  | 31.2%   | 135.0%   | 1.0   | 90.4    |
| 2023-2025  | 232.0%  | 5.8%    | 189.0%   | 1.0   | 103.2   |

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant volatility, with periods of substantial losses followed by periods of large gains.  The high Alpha values suggest outperformance relative to the benchmark, but this should be interpreted in context with the high Beta (1.0), indicating high volatility and correlation with the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $510.43
* **5-day Moving Average:** $495.71
* **20-day Moving Average:** $472.68
* **60-day Moving Average:** $457.73

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small gap between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, coupled with the larger gap to the 60-day moving average, hints at a recent acceleration in the upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 72.82 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.81 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.5% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.6% (This implies underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.)

The RSI is nearing overbought conditions, suggesting potential for a near-term correction.  However, the positive PPO and recent price movement indicate continued momentum.  The significant price increase from the previous close (+$1.78 or +0.36%) suggests a recent surge, which could be a factor contributing to the overbought RSI. The negative long-term expected return is a significant concern.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61     | 1.88         | -0.27       |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33     | 1.06         | +0.27       |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.97     | 0.65         | +0.32       |
| 2024-02-06 | -0.39    | -0.08        | -0.31       |
| 2023-10-24 | 0.33     | -0.22        | +0.55       |

Earnings have shown volatility.  While recent quarters have exceeded expectations, the November 2024 results fell short, highlighting the unpredictable nature of the company's earnings.  Consistent positive surprises are needed to justify the current valuation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this is countered by concerns around its high volatility and the negative long-term expected return relative to the market.  While recent price action and some financial metrics are positive, the approaching overbought RSI and inconsistent earnings suggest caution.  The high valuation and potential for near-term correction should be considered.  Investing in SPOT requires a high-risk tolerance, and a long-term perspective is crucial, though the projected negative alpha casts doubt on long-term outperformance versus the S&P 500.  Further investigation into competitive pressures and growth prospects is recommended before making any investment decision.
