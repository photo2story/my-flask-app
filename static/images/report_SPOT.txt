**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Spotify Technology SA is a global audio streaming and media services provider.  SPOT's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) by 66.1 percentage points.  The high relative divergence (92.1%) suggests this outperformance is substantial compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. However,  this is a snapshot in time and past performance is not indicative of future results.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods. This indicates the stock's performance is not consistently correlated with the market.  High beta values (e.g., 64.4 in 2018-2020) suggest higher volatility than the market, while negative alpha values suggest underperformance relative to the market's risk-adjusted return.  The significant swings in CAGR highlight the considerable risk associated with SPOT's investment.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2018-2020  | 64.0% | 76.9% | 29.0% | -0.0 | 64.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 28.0% | 76.9% | -18.0% | 0.1 | 47.9 |
| 2020-2022  | -48.0% | 76.9% | -53.0% | 0.1 | 16.2 |
| 2021-2023  | -69.0% | 72.2% | -0.5 | 38.5 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $592.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $575.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $557.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $578.71

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 60-day moving average indicates the uptrend might be weakening. The recent price increase of $0.39 (0.07%) is relatively small and doesn't suggest a significant, sudden price movement (no rapid surge or decline).

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.39 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.95 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +4.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -11.8% (Long-term negative expected return relative to the S&P 500)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While momentum indicators (PPO and Relative Divergence) are positive, the expected return is negative, suggesting caution.  The MRI indicates a moderate level of risk.

**5. Financial Information:**

Equity is also growing, however, ROE shows some volatility, with a negative value in Q4 2023.  This fluctuation requires further investigation into the underlying causes.

| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |

| 2024-12-31  | $4.24B    | 32.25%        |

| 2023-12-31  | $2.52B    | -2.77%  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify shows a strong historical return relative to the S&P 500.  However, the recent negative expected return, coupled with significant volatility (high beta values and MDD), suggests considerable risk.  While the company demonstrates growth in revenue and profitability, the inconsistent earnings and ROE require further investigation.  Investors should consider the high volatility and potential for significant losses before investing, especially given the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500.  A thorough due diligence process, including a deeper examination of the company's financials and competitive landscape, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The -11.8% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term presents a serious concern, potentially indicating a need for reevaluation of the investment strategy.
