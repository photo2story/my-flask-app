## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Stock Report

This report analyzes Spotify Technology SA (SPOT), a leading global music streaming service, based on provided data.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Spotify's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO) at 282.83% versus 100.24%. The provided data shows an immense divergence, with a current difference of 182.6%, representing the 100th percentile of historical relative divergence.  This indicates SPOT has substantially outperformed VOO in the observed period.  However, this exceptional performance may not be sustainable.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a volatile performance history.  While exhibiting periods of high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market),  SPOT has also experienced periods of significant negative returns and negative alpha, particularly from 2020 to 2023.  The beta fluctuates, suggesting sensitivity to market movements but with varying degrees over time. The high beta in earlier periods indicates greater market sensitivity. The sharply increasing beta in 2023-2025 may indicate increasing market sensitivity to SPOT's stock movements. The large market cap fluctuation indicates significant changes in market valuation over the years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

SPOT's current closing price is $648.32.  The stock has shown a recent upward trend:

* **5-day moving average:** $634.55
* **20-day moving average:** $562.33
* **60-day moving average:** $501.26

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting positive momentum.  The recent price change of $1.21 (from $640.59) indicates a minor positive move.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 89.14 suggests the stock is significantly overbought, indicating potential for a price correction.  A PPO of 1.0962 also suggests strong upward momentum. The relative strength of the recent price increase is supported by the positive 20-day relative divergence change of +0.3.  However, the high RSI warrants caution.  The expected return of -10.2% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is notable, suggesting potential underperformance despite current overbought conditions. This negative expected return might be based on factors not fully captured by the provided data and should be viewed with caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

SPOT has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters, except for the quarter ending February 6, 2024.  The trend shows improving earnings growth.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify exhibits strong growth in revenue and profitability, exceeding earnings expectations and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 in the observed period. However, the high RSI, negative long-term expected return relative to the market, and volatile historical performance (as indicated by the Alpha/Beta analysis) raise concerns about sustainability.  The recent price action shows positive momentum, but the overbought conditions suggest a potential correction.  Investors should carefully consider the risk-reward profile before making investment decisions. Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative expected return and the historical volatility is recommended.  A more comprehensive analysis, including a deeper dive into the company's competitive landscape and future growth prospects, is needed for a more informed investment decision.
