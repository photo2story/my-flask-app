**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2018-2020  | 92.0% | 12.7% | 54.0% | 0.1 | 64.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 45.0% | 16.6% | -26.0% | 0.1 | 48.2 |

| 2022-2024  | 158.0% | 31.2% | 125.0% | -0.3 | 92.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 287.0% | 5.8% | 230.0% | 1.2 | 125.2 |

The table shows high volatility (large CAGR swings and MDD) and inconsistent alpha, indicating periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. Beta fluctuates, suggesting sensitivity to market movements varies over time.  The significant increase in alpha and beta in 2023-2025 suggests a recent period of strong performance and increased market correlation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $608.01
* **Last Market Price:** $611.66 (Slight increase of $0.60)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $598.42
* **20-day Moving Average:** $614.59
* **60-day Moving Average:** $525.35

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average but below the 20-day and significantly above the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent price increase after a period of lower prices.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.9  (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -1.59 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -11.8% (Expected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term, based on this data).  This is concerning, given the previously high outperformance.  Further investigation into the reasoning for this negative expectation is needed.  This may reflect market sentiment.

The recent price increase is modest and doesn't significantly alter the overall picture.  The negative expected return warrants careful consideration.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |

EPS has been consistently below expectations, except for the last two quarters.  This inconsistency needs further investigation to understand the drivers behind the underperformance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify's past performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. However, the projected future return is negative relative to the market, despite recent improvements in financial statements and recent strong quarterly growth.  The high volatility and inconsistent alpha suggest a high-risk investment. While the recent financial results are positive, the inconsistency in earnings versus expectations and the negative projected return compared to the S&P 500 raise concerns. Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind these inconsistencies and the negative long-term expected return before making any investment decisions.  A deeper dive into the drivers of revenue growth, the reasons for EPS missing estimates, and the specific assumptions behind the -11.8% expected return is crucial for a complete assessment.
