This report analyzes Spotify Technology SA (SPOT), a digital music, podcast, and audio streaming service provider.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference is 190.03% - 99.32% = 90.71%.  This places Spotify's performance in the 94.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  While this shows strong relative performance, it's crucial to consider the volatility indicated by the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures in the subsequent section.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), MDD, Alpha, and Beta across different periods. Notably, the recent 2022-2024 period exhibits exceptionally high CAGR and Alpha, potentially indicating a recent period of outperformance. However, the considerable fluctuations in these metrics highlight the volatility inherent in Spotify's stock.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2018-2020  | 92.0% | 12.7% | 55.0% | 0.1 | 64.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $483.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $478.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $478.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $416.12

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, the relatively small difference between the short-term moving averages and the recent price suggests the upward momentum might be slowing.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.48 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.97 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -4.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -14.6% (Expected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term)

The current price of $483.31 does not indicate a dramatic recent surge or drop, aligning with the relatively small difference between short-term moving averages.  The negative expected return, however, is a significant concern.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a mixed picture. While EPS has generally improved quarter-over-quarter, there have been some significant misses against expectations, particularly in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.  The most recent quarter shows a beat of expectations.

Spotify shows strong relative past performance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by a high cumulative return. However, the high volatility and negative expected return raise concerns.  While revenue and profit margins are growing, inconsistent earnings results and the negative long-term expected return warrant caution.
