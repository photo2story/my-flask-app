Spotify Technology SA is a digital music, podcast, and video streaming service provider.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with a considerably higher cumulative return. However, recent performance indicates volatility and potential risk.


**1) Cumulative Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Spotify (SPOT) Cumulative Return:** 101.21%
* **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 45.56%

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance relative to the market (Beta) and inconsistent excess returns (Alpha) over different periods.

Market capitalization (Cap(B)) also fluctuates significantly, indicating market sentiment shifts.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $576.94
* **Previous Close:** $597.73
* **Change:** -$3.48 (a -0.58% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $598.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $564.20
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $582.60

The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend, although it's above its 20-day moving average, indicating some potential short-term support.  The recent price drop is notable.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.379 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 61.89 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.80 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -7.5% (Short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, 2+ years):** -13.9% (vs. S&P 500).  This suggests that despite the historical outperformance, current expectations are for underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  The significant recent price drop (-$3.48) reinforces this negative outlook.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Spotify has shown increasing EPS, exceeding expectations in recent quarters (except Q1 2024).  However, the significant miss in Q1 2024 is concerning.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.88 | 2.06 | -0.18 |
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61 | 1.88 | -0.27 |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33 | 1.06 | +0.27 |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.97 | 0.65 | +0.32 |
| 2024-02-06 | -0.39 | -0.08 | -0.31 |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is steadily increasing, demonstrating consistent growth. Profit margins are also improving, indicating better operational efficiency. Equity and ROE are also trending upwards, suggesting improving financial health. However, the significant negative ROE in 2023-12-31 is a point of concern.


| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity | ROE |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $4.24B | 32.25% | $5.53B | 6.64% |
| 2024-09-30 | $3.99B | 31.09% | $4.63B | 6.48% |
| 2024-06-30 | $3.81B | 29.21% | $4.26B | 6.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.64B | 27.61% | $3.31B | 5.95% |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.67B | 26.70% | $2.52B | -2.77% |



**6) Overall Analysis:**

Spotify has shown periods of strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by revenue growth and improving profitability. However, recent performance is weaker, with a notable price drop and negative expected long-term return relative to the market.  The Q1 2024 earnings miss is a significant negative. While financial health indicators are generally improving, the volatility and inconsistent Alpha/Beta results suggest significant risk.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and the Q1 2024 earnings miss is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The -13.9% expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests caution.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for future growth against the inherent volatility and risks involved.
