## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Stock Report

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Spotify Technology SA is a global audio streaming and media services provider.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with a substantial cumulative return difference.  However, recent performance shows volatility and requires deeper analysis of underlying factors.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **SPOT Cumulative Return:** 100.30%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 35.33%
* **Return Difference:** 64.97% (SPOT significantly outperformed VOO)
* **Relative Divergence:** 87.8% (SPOT's performance is in the upper 87.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO).  This high relative divergence suggests a potentially unsustainable level of outperformance.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly variable Alpha and Beta values over the years.  High Beta values (e.g., 64.4 in 2018-2020) indicate high volatility and correlation with the market.  Negative Alphas suggest underperformance relative to the market in some periods (e.g., -0.4 in 2021-2023).  The significant swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlight the risk associated with SPOT.  The increasing market cap suggests growth, but the erratic performance needs further investigation.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2018-2020  | 64.0% | 76.9% | 32.0% | -0.0 | 64.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 28.0% | 76.9% | -14.0% | 0.0 | 47.9 |
| 2020-2022  | -48.0% | 76.9% | -51.0% | 0.0 | 16.2 |
| 2021-2023  | -69.0% | 72.2% | -0.4 | 38.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 76.0% | 72.4% | -0.6 | 91.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 128.0% | 72.4% | -0.1 | 116.5 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $569.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $533.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $566.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $567.71

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.  However, it's close to the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance. The significant daily change of 9.78 points to a recent rapid price increase.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk) – This suggests a high level of market uncertainty and potential volatility.
* **RSI:** 44.68 (Slightly below neutral) – Not significantly oversold or overbought, indicating a relatively neutral short-term momentum.
* **PPO:** -0.66 (Negative) – Suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -12% –  This indicates a negative expected return, which contradicts the current price action and overall history.  Further analysis is needed to understand this discrepancy.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is unclear and needs more data.  The current price surge needs explanation against this negative prediction. The recent price increase (9.78) signals a potential sharp upward movement, which seems at odds with the negative expected return.  This requires further investigation.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has shown increasing EPS (Earnings Per Share) in recent quarters, generally exceeding expectations.  However, the significant jump in Q2 2024 suggests further investigation to understand any underlying factors contributing to this change.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown impressive historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent data reveals volatility and conflicting signals. While recent earnings and financial data suggest improvement, the negative expected return (-12%) and high market risk indicator (MRI) raise concerns. The recent sharp price increase needs further explanation in the context of the negative expected return.  A deeper dive into the drivers of recent earnings growth,  analysis of subscriber growth and churn rates, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors are crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.  The significant variability in Alpha and Beta further highlights the risk profile of this investment.  The extremely high relative divergence, while suggestive of outperformance, also raises questions about sustainability.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence and consideration of the inherent risks are essential.
