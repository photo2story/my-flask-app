**Analysis:**

Spotify has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in the recent period with a cumulative return difference of -19.45%. The relative divergence of 58.78% suggests that this underperformance is within the historical range, indicating it's not drastically abnormal. The alpha and beta values point to a stock with higher risk (beta) and a potential for higher returns (alpha) compared to the market benchmark. However, the recent underperformance warrants closer scrutiny of the company's financial health and market outlook.

The most recent earnings report shows that Spotify exceeded analysts' expectations, with an EPS of 1.33 compared to the expected 1.06. This positive earnings surprise might contribute to the recent upward momentum of the stock. However, further analysis of the company's long-term growth prospects and potential challenges is needed to confirm sustainable growth.
