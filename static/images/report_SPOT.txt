## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Investment Report

This report analyzes Spotify Technology SA (SPOT), a leading global music streaming and podcast platform, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify's cumulative return (190.09%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (105.66%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 84.4%, placing it at the 97.5th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  This suggests strong relative performance, but historical performance is not indicative of future results.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2018-2020  | 93.0% | 12.8% | 54.0% | 0.1 | 64.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 47.0% | 16.6% | -27.0% | 0.1 | 47.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -45.0% | 31.3% | -56.0% | 0.1 | 16.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -76.0% | 31.3% | -101.0% | 0.1 | 38.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 177.0% | 31.3% | 136.0% | 0.1 | 96.0 |

The data shows high volatility (MDD) and significant swings in CAGR. Alpha consistently shows outperformance relative to the benchmark (though this is likely linked to the beta being close to 0.1). Beta consistently around 0.1 suggests low correlation with the overall market.  However, the provided alpha and beta are not consistently calculated and require clarification on the benchmark used.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 476.96
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 477.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 440.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 391.26

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The significant difference between the 20-day and 60-day averages suggests a more recent, sharper price increase.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 78.29 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a pullback)
* **PPO:** 0.16 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** NaN (-) indicating a recent short-term decline.  However, the closing price of 476.34, being higher than the 20-day moving average, suggests a recent recovery from this decline. This could be considered a rapid rebound (considering the context provided).
* **Expected Return:** -21.9% (This is a long-term (2+ years) expected underperformance relative to the S&P 500. The negative expected return is concerning and needs further investigation.)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61     | 1.88         | Miss      |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33     | 1.06         | Beat      |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.97     | 0.65         | Beat      |
| 2024-02-06 | -0.39    | -0.08        | Miss      |
| 2023-10-24 | 0.33     | -0.22        | Beat      |

EPS has shown significant volatility. While there have been beats and misses, the most recent quarter (2024-11-12) missed expectations.  A consistent trend is not easily discernable from this short data sample.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

Revenue shows consistent growth, although the rate of growth appears to be slowing. Profit margins have also been increasing steadily.

**Capital and Profitability:**

Equity has increased significantly, and ROE has improved recently, suggesting improved profitability and financial health.  However, there was a negative ROE in 2023-12-31.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  The provided data does not include this information.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify's performance has been volatile but has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the provided period.  However, the provided -21.9% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a serious concern.  Recent price action suggests a short-term uptrend, but the RSI suggests it might be overbought.  The earnings data shows volatility and inconsistent results.  Further investigation into the provided alpha/beta,  the missing news and analyst opinions, and the basis for the -21.9% expected return are crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The financial data shows promising revenue and profit margin growth and improvement in equity and ROE.  The overall picture is mixed and requires further analysis before making any investment decisions.  Caution is advised due to the high volatility and the negative long-term expected return relative to the benchmark.
