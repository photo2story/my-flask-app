The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  Further investigation into the reasons for missed earnings expectations and the sustainability of the long-term outperformance relative to the market is needed before making any investment decisions.  The high relative divergence also warrants caution, suggesting a potential reversion to the mean may be likely.  Long-term investors should carefully consider the risks involved given the high volatility and significant market sensitivity.
