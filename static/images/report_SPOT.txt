| 2021-2023  | -39.6%  | 71.1%   | -74.5%| 1.7   | 37.7    |
| 2022-2024  | 87.7%   | 62.8%   | 59.8% | 1.6   | 95.9    |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 458.32 (Last Market: 458.38)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 446.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 401.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 370.95

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, but the relatively high RSI (see below) indicates it might be overbought.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (75.52):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (1.93):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, but the high RSI suggests caution.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+22.92):** Shows recent strong upward momentum.

Given the last market price of 458.38, and the high RSI, there's a possibility of a short-term correction rather than a sharp upward or downward movement.  The Expected Return of -0.02% suggests a very low expected return at the current moment, potentially highlighting a temporary overvaluation. Long-term (2+ years) investment with dollar-cost averaging may offer a potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500, given SPOT's historical outperformance, but this should be considered with caution given the high RSI and recent market volatility.
