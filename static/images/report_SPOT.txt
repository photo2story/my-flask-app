**6. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify shows strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, but recent data presents a mixed picture.  While the stock price displays positive short-term momentum and financial figures are generally improving, the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  The inconsistency in earnings performance also warrants further investigation.  A deeper dive into the company's growth strategy and competitive landscape is needed to fully assess the investment opportunity.  The high volatility, reflected in the fluctuating beta, should also be considered.  Further analysis of qualitative factors is necessary before making a definitive investment decision.
