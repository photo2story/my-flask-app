This report analyzes Spotify Technology SA (SPOT), a leading global music streaming service, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify's cumulative return (178.76%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (99.46%) over the unspecified period.  The difference is 79.3%, placing it at the 95.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. This indicates strong relative performance, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show varying performance relative to the market (S&P 500) across different periods.  Positive alpha values suggest outperformance, while beta values greater than 1 indicate higher volatility than the market.  The significant negative CAGR (-47.9% and -39.6%) in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023, respectively, are noteworthy and indicate periods of underperformance relative to the market.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values during these periods reflect significant price drops. Recent years show improved performance with positive CAGR and reduced MDD.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $458.32 (Last Market: $458.38)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $446.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $401.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $370.95

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish trend in the short-term.  The relatively large gap between the short-term (5-day) and longer-term (60-day) moving averages indicates recent strong upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (75.52):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (1.93):**  A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (22.92%):** Shows recent strong upward movement.
* **Expected Return (-0.02%):**  A negative expected return suggests a potential downside risk, potentially counteracted by long-term growth potential.

The price of $458.38 does not appear to indicate a sharp recent upturn or downturn given its proximity to the 5-day moving average and upward trend reflected in the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. However, the RSI indicates caution.  The negative expected return should be considered cautiously, particularly as it appears to only account for short-term risk and does not reflect the significant long-term upside potential.



**4. Recent Earnings and Forecasts:**

The earnings show a mixed picture. While recent quarters show EPS exceeding expectations, there are instances where expectations were missed, especially in earlier quarters (e.g., Q4 2023). The most recent earnings (2024-11-12) show an EPS of 1.61 against an expectation of 1.88, meaning the company missed expectations by approximately 14%.  Monitoring future EPS reports is critical for evaluating the company's ongoing performance.


**6. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue has been steadily increasing, although profit margins have shown some fluctuation.  The Q2 2024 results are very positive compared to the prior year, indicating a likely positive trend.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been increasing, showing a positive trend for the company. Return on Equity (ROE) has fluctuated considerably, with negative values in Q4 2023 and Q2 2023, highlighting periods of underperformance.  Monitoring the ROE is crucial to understand the effectiveness of the company's investment decisions.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify has demonstrated strong relative performance compared to the S&P 500 over the longer term, though this includes periods of significant underperformance.  Recent price action suggests upward momentum, supported by moving averages. However, technical indicators warn of overbought conditions (RSI). While revenue is growing and profitability is largely positive, recent earnings have missed expectations and the ROE has fluctuated, reflecting periods of both strong and weak performance. A deeper dive into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial to fully assess the current market sentiment and outlook.  Long-term investors should consider the inherent volatility and the mixed signals from earnings and financial performance.
