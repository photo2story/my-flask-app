**Analysis of Alpha and Beta:**  The alpha and beta values show significant volatility over time.  While recent periods (2023-2025) show high CAGR and positive alpha, suggesting outperformance, previous years demonstrate periods of substantial underperformance and negative alpha.  The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  The fluctuating market capitalization reflects this volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $637.69
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $626.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $537.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $492.13

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively large gap between the closing price and the 20 and 60-day moving averages indicates a recent, sharp price increase.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 97.12 (Extremely overbought, suggesting potential for a correction)
* **PPO:** 1.91 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -10.3% (Expected underperformance relative to S&P 500)

The high RSI and relatively small price change despite the overbought conditions warrant caution.  The negative expected return highlights the need to carefully consider long-term investment strategies.  The recent price increase (indicated by 'Last-market' data) supports the idea of a potential short-term correction.

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |

| 2024-02-06 | -0.39    | -0.08         | -0.31      |

**Analysis:**  While the last two quarters show positive EPS surprises, the recent quarters show consistent underperformance relative to expectations.  This suggests a potential downward trend in earnings.  Further investigation into the reasons for the miss in expectations is needed.

**Analysis:** Revenue and profit margins are showing consistent growth.  However, the high RSI and negative expected return suggest caution.  The significant improvement in equity and ROE compared to the previous year is a positive sign.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown impressive growth compared to the S&P 500, but its high valuation (indicated by the overbought RSI and high relative performance) and inconsistent earnings performance raise concerns.  The recent price surge might be unsustainable in the long term. While the financial information suggests improving health, the negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 and the potential for a correction due to the extremely overbought RSI should be carefully considered.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the earnings misses is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Long-term investors might find SPOT attractive given its growth potential, but the risks of short-term volatility should be acknowledged.
