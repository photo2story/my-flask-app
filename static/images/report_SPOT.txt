## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Spotify Technology SA is a leading global music streaming and podcast platform.  This report analyzes SPOT's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering its price movement, financial indicators, and recent earnings.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Spotify's cumulative return (139.61%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (75.02%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 64.6%, placing it at the 83.3rd percentile of its historical range (max: 95.6%, min: -89.6%). This indicates strong relative performance, but the high relative percentile suggests potential for future underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta data reveals fluctuating performance against the market.  While periods of strong alpha (outperformance) exist (2018-2020, 2019-2021), significant negative alpha and high maximum drawdown (MDD) are also observed in the subsequent years (2020-2024), indicating periods of high risk. Notably, Beta values fluctuate, reflecting varying sensitivity to market movements.  Market capitalization (Cap) shows considerable growth.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2018-2020  | 104.0% | 71.5% | 65.0% | 0.1 | 64.5 |
| 2019-2021  | 44.0% | 71.5% | -29.0% | 0.2 | 48.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -56.0% | 71.5% | -68.0% | 0.2 | 16.2 |
| 2021-2023  | -98.0% | 57.2% | -0.6 | 38.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 98.0% | 66.2% | -0.7 | 91.7 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

SPOT's closing price is $550.03.  The last market price was $551.31, a slight increase of $0.23 from the previous close.  The stock price is currently below its 5-day ($576.73), 20-day ($566.44), and 60-day ($558.87) moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk).
* **RSI:** 58.77 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought).
* **PPO:** -0.35 (Negative; indicates bearish momentum).
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -11.4% (Short-term bearish trend).
* **Expected Return:** -16.8% (The expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years)).  This is likely connected to the negative alpha observed in recent years.  The slight price increase from the previous close ($0.23) is not substantial enough to signal a significant reversal.

The earnings per share (EPS) show an upward trend, although the company has missed analyst expectations in some quarters.  The positive EPS growth suggests a growing business, though the consistent misses on EPS expectations should be investigated further.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but recent years show significant volatility and periods of underperformance.  While revenue and profitability are increasing, the company has consistently missed EPS expectations.  Technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend, and the long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500.  Investors should carefully consider the high volatility and risk before investing in SPOT.  Further investigation into the reasons for missed EPS expectations and the factors driving the fluctuating Alpha and Beta is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
