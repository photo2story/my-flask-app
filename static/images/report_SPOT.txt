**0. Summary Statistics:**

Spotify Technology SA is a global audio streaming and media services provider.  The following report analyzes its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), utilizing provided financial and technical indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify's cumulative return (226.63%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (98.32%).  The difference is 128.3 percentage points, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  However, this high relative performance is heavily influenced by the volatility exhibited in the Alpha/Beta analysis, meaning  past performance does not guarantee future results.

|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2018-2020  | 92.0% | 12.7% | 54.0% | 0.1 | 63.6 |

The table shows significant volatility in Spotify's performance and its relationship with the overall market (Beta). While high CAGR is observed in some periods, particularly recently, substantial negative CAGRs and high maximum drawdowns (MDD) highlight the inherent risk.  Alpha, while showing periods of outperformance, is highly inconsistent.  Market capitalization (Cap) shows growth over time.

* **Previous Close:** $550.13
* **Change:** -$0.29 (Slight decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $536.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $493.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $470.11

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential uptrend.  However, the recent slight decrease warrants monitoring.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (92.60):**  Extremely overbought, indicating a potential pullback.
* **PPO (1.33):** Positive, suggesting upward momentum, although high RSI suggests caution.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:**  0.0 (-), indicating recent short-term downward pressure.
* **Expected Return (-10.4%):**  Suggests a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This needs further investigation to confirm the basis for the estimation and assumptions made in arriving at the -10.4%.  The -0.29 change from the previous close reflects a minor decrease and may not indicate any major market shifts.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify's stock has exhibited strong cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500, but this performance has been volatile.  The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to a correction. While recent financial performance shows growth in revenue and profit margins, EPS has shown significant variability.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 warrants caution and careful consideration of the underlying assumptions.  Further research into the factors contributing to the -10.4% expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for high growth against the considerable risk associated with Spotify's volatile performance.  Long-term investors might consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate risk.
