**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data is available, hindering a comprehensive financial analysis.  This critical information gap prevents a robust assessment of SPOT's financial health and growth prospects.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown periods of significant outperformance against the S&P 500, particularly in recent periods as indicated by the high cumulative return and relative divergence. However, the considerable volatility, inconsistent earnings performance relative to expectations, and a negative long-term expected return against the S&P 500 raise concerns.  The lack of key financial data further limits a thorough assessment.  The high RSI suggests potential short-term overvaluation.  A more comprehensive analysis necessitates access to complete financial statements and a deeper dive into the factors driving earnings fluctuations and market sentiment.  The substantial volatility warrants careful consideration of risk tolerance before investing.
