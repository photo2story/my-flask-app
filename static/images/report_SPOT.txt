**6) Overall Analysis:**

Spotify has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500, but this has been volatile. While recent earnings show improvement and revenue is growing, the negative ROE in Q4 2023 and the projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers behind the fluctuating Alpha and Beta, as well as the negative Q1 2024 EPS and the negative ROE in 2023 Q4.  A deeper dive into the company's financials and future growth prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current short-term indicators suggest a bullish trend, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain given the projected underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
