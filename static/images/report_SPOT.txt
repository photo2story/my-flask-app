* **5-Day Moving Average:** $563.54
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $559.40
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $576.07

* **Expected Return:** -12.9% (Significant negative expectation for the short term)

**Analysis:**  The indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO and relative divergence suggest some positive momentum, the negative expected return and moderately high risk assessment suggest caution. The price drop reflects some negative sentiment that isn't fully reflected in the indicators.

| 2024-02-06 | -0.39   | -0.08        |

**Analysis:**  While recent EPS has consistently exceeded expectations, the overall trend shows a decrease in both actual and expected EPS. The significant negative EPS in February 2024 is a concern.

| 2023-12-31 | $2.52      | -2.77   |

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

SPOT has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, demonstrating substantial growth potential. However,  the high volatility, mixed technical indicators, and recent earnings trends suggest caution.  While the long-term potential may be significant (indicated by the high CAGR in some periods), the short-term outlook appears uncertain and negatively predicted.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the February 2024 EPS drop and the overall market sentiment around SPOT is necessary before making any investment decisions.  A long-term (2+ years) investment approach, factoring in potential volatility, might be suitable for risk-tolerant investors.  Close monitoring of key financial indicators and market trends is strongly recommended.
