**6) Overall Analysis:**

Spotify has shown periods of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with substantial volatility. While recent financial results and price action appear positive, the -12.5% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a cautionary sign.  Investors should carefully consider the high volatility and inconsistent performance observed in the past before making long-term investment decisions. The positive earnings surprises and improving financial metrics suggest potential for future growth, but the risk of underperformance relative to the market remains.  Further investigation into specific growth drivers and market risks is essential before forming a definite investment opinion.
