**6. Overall Conclusion:**

SPOT has shown significant long-term outperformance against the S&P 500. However, recent performance indicates some short-term volatility and a potential correction.  While the fundamental financial data suggests a healthy growing company, the recent price drop and the negative short-term expected return warrant caution.  The long-term outlook (2+ years), assuming the company continues its revenue and profit growth, remains positive relative to the S&P 500, but further analysis of market conditions and competitive landscape would be necessary to confirm this.  The high volatility should be considered before investing.  The -14.3% expected return is specifically short-term, and doesn't negate the possibility of long-term outperformance given a continued positive fundamental trajectory.
