**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Based on the information provided, here's a comprehensive summary:

*   **Performance:** Spotify has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined, as shown by the cumulative return comparison. However, the annual CAGR analysis reveals volatile performance in recent years.
*   **Risk:** Spotify's stock carries substantial risk, demonstrated by the high MDD values. The negative Beta indicates the price moves counter to the S&P 500 (VOO), although the sensitivity is very low.
*   **Market Sentiment:**  Analyst consensus leans toward a "Buy" rating, and the average target price is significantly higher than the current price, suggesting potential upside. However, the mixed news headlines and the recent price decline highlight some investor concerns.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The RSI is neutral, and the PPO is slightly positive. However, the recent decline in relative divergence and the negative expected return suggest caution. The 5-day SMA falling below the 20-day SMA can sometimes be interpreted as a bearish signal, though further confirmation is needed. The MRI of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, but the negative expected return suggests potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.
*   **News Impact:** The news headlines indicate that Spotify is under investor scrutiny. While some articles highlight potential, others focus on recent declines and profitability concerns. The news about a stock split could be relevant.

**In Conclusion:**

Spotify presents a complex picture. While it has demonstrated significant outperformance in the past and has a positive analyst outlook, it also exhibits high risk and recent signs of short-term weakness. The mixed news sentiment and the negative expected return warrant careful consideration before investing. Investors should carefully weigh the potential upside against the inherent risks and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.
