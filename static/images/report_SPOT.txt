**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend. The recent price increase (Last-market) is a minor positive, but not enough to significantly alter the bearish signal from the moving averages.

* **PPO (-0.1688):** Negative PPO confirms bearish momentum.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** Moderate risk (0.4585).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has shown increasing EPS over the past year, exceeding expectations in some quarters (2024 Q2 and Q3). However, the most recent quarter (2025 Q1) shows a slight miss against expectations.  Further analysis is needed to determine the cause and sustainability of this trend.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.88 | 2.06 |
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61 | 1.88 |

| 2024-04-23 | 0.97 | 0.65 |
| 2024-02-06 | -0.39 | -0.08 |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows consistent growth, with healthy profit margins.  Equity has also increased, suggesting a strengthening balance sheet. However, ROE (Return on Equity) was negative in 2023 Q4 but has since turned positive, indicating improved profitability.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $4.24B | 32.25% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify's historical performance has been exceptional, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  While the company shows consistent revenue growth and improving profitability, the projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and negative alpha in several periods raise concerns.  Investors should carefully consider the high volatility and market sensitivity (high beta) before investing.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent earnings miss and the discrepancy between cumulative returns and alpha is necessary to form a comprehensive investment opinion.  The oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook requires more in-depth fundamental analysis.
