## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Spotify (SPOT) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The cumulative return for SPOT is 189.05%, while VOO's is 104.46%, resulting in a difference of 84.6%.  This places SPOT at the 97.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided data's range of maximum and minimum outperformance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently high Alpha values (ranging from 1.9 to 2.9), indicating that SPOT has generated significant returns beyond what would be expected based on its beta (market risk). Beta values, while fluctuating, generally suggest a higher sensitivity to market movements than the S&P 500.  However, the negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 highlights periods of underperformance. The most recent period (2022-2024) shows a strong recovery.  The high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) suggest periods of significant risk.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) also fluctuates considerably, showing a large increase from 2021 to 2024.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $475.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $436.08

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +19.0 –  Indicates a recent strong upward trend.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -22.2% – This suggests that over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, the model anticipates a potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, given that this is a projection, other factors like growth potential should also be considered.

**4. Recent Earnings & Outlook:**

The large discrepancy between actual and expected EPS should be further investigated.

**7. Summary:**

Spotify shows strong long-term growth potential (based on the cumulative return), but also significant volatility and risk (indicated by the high MDD and RSI). While recent performance has been positive, surpassing the S&P 500 considerably, technical indicators suggest an overbought condition. The earnings reports show a recent improvement.  Long-term projections are mixed, with the model indicating a potential for underperformance compared to the S&P 500. A thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions.


**8. Recommendations:**

Further investigation is warranted before making any investment decisions. It's recommended to consult financial professionals, review updated financial news, and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in SPOT.  The overbought RSI and mixed long-term projection merit caution.  The high historical outperformance against the S&P 500 is noteworthy but does not guarantee future success. Consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate risk.
