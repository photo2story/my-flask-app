**7. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify has demonstrated significant past outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this has been marked by substantial volatility.  While recent financial performance indicates revenue growth and improving profitability, the high Beta and negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 over the next two years are significant concerns. The high RSI suggests caution regarding potential short-term price corrections. Investors should consider the significant risk associated with this stock, given its high volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Further analysis, including a more detailed examination of the company's competitive landscape and long-term growth prospects, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The relatively high equity levels may be a mitigating factor, but this should also be carefully assessed against risks.
