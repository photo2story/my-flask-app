## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Stock Report

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Spotify Technology SA is a global audio streaming and media services provider.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with substantial volatility.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **SPOT Cumulative Return:** 100.30%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 43.42%
* **Return Difference:** 56.9%  (This represents SPOT's outperformance compared to VOO at the last data point.  The relative divergence of 92.2% indicates SPOT's performance is in the top 92.2% percentile of its historical range relative to VOO.)

The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO). While showing periods of significant outperformance (e.g., 2023-2025), it also experienced substantial underperformance (e.g., 2020-2022).  Beta values fluctuate considerably, suggesting sensitivity to market movements which varies significantly over time.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) exhibits growth but isn't consistently correlated with returns.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2018-2020  | 64.0% | 76.9% | 26.0% | -0.0 | 63.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 28.0% | 76.9% | -27.0% | 0.1 | 47.4 |
| 2020-2022  | -48.0% | 76.9% | -54.0% | 0.0 | 16.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -69.0% | 72.2% | -85.0% | -0.5 | 38.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 76.0% | 72.4% | 59.0% | -0.7 | 90.6 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $569.06
* **Last Market Price:** $562.98 (a decrease of $1.07 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $533.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $566.6975
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $567.7068

The price is slightly below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The 5-day moving average is considerably lower, indicating recent volatility. The recent price drop is relatively minor and doesn't indicate a sharp decline.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4271 (Low-Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.68 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.66 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.7% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -13.6% (relative to the S&P 500. This implies that, based on this model, long-term investment in SPOT may yield a lower return than VOO.)

The negative PPO and relatively low RSI suggest potential for further downside, but the positive relative divergence and approach to oversold conditions in the RSI create some ambiguity.  The small price drop does not warrant labeling it as a sharp decline.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Spotify (SPOT) has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, but this performance has been highly volatile.  While recent financial performance shows growth in revenue and improving profit margins, earnings have been inconsistent relative to expectations. Technical indicators suggest a mixed outlook, with some signs of bearish momentum and others pointing to potential upward movement. The significant variation in Alpha and Beta values indicates the stock's return is highly dependent on market conditions. The long-term outlook (2+ years) based on provided expected return, compared to VOO, is negative, highlighting the inherent risks.  Further investigation into the drivers of this volatility, as well as a deeper dive into competitive landscape and future growth projections would be necessary for a complete assessment.  The information provided is insufficient to give a definitive buy/sell recommendation.
