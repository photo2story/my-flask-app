SPOT has shown impressive historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by significant volatility. Recent price movements suggest a short-term positive trend, though the long-term expected return is negative.  The company shows positive revenue and profit margin growth, along with increasing equity and ROE.  However,  the inconsistent earnings performance compared to expectations, and the negative long-term expected return raise concerns.  Further investigation is needed to determine the sustainability of SPOTâ€™s growth and the reasons for the negative long-term expected return.  A deep dive into the company's strategy, competitive landscape, and macro-economic factors influencing the music streaming industry would provide a more complete and informed assessment.  A more detailed risk assessment considering various scenarios and their probability is also necessary.
