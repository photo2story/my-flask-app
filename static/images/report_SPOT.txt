2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Spotify (SPOT) based on the provided data:

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** Spotify Technology SA is a leading global audio streaming subscription service.
*   **Return Rate:** Spotify's cumulative return (99.91%) outperforms the S&P 500's (75.99%).
*   **Divergence:** The current divergence of 23.9 is within the historical range (max 120.4, min -65.1), positioning it at the 48th percentile of past divergences. This suggests a moderate outperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   The data shows varying performance across different periods.
    *   **CAGR:** Varies significantly, with periods of strong growth (130% in 2023-2025) and substantial decline (-56% in 2020-2022).
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown indicates risk, with MDD exceeding 50% in some periods.
    *   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to its beta-adjusted benchmark *except* the most recent 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods where it shows significant outperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values consistently above 1.0 indicate that Spotify's price is more volatile than the overall market (S&P 500). The beta has reduced to 1.1 in the latest period.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Cap figures demonstrate increasing market capitalization and investor confidence in the latest period.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $575.0
*   **Recent Performance:** The price decreased slightly compared to the previous close (-0.98%).
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 579.586
    *   20-day SMA: 580.256
    *   60-day SMA: 618.9018

    *The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are very close and slightly declining, and the current price is below these averages indicating a short-term downward trend. The 60-day SMA is significantly higher, suggesting that the longer-term trend is still positive, but potentially weakening.*

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return:**

*   **PPO:** 0.34 (Positive, suggesting a slightly bullish trend, but close to zero)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Recommends a conservative approach: 90% buy of available cash (2 shares). This is a relatively safe approach given the medium MRI.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -1.3 (Short-term decline in relative performance vs. S&P 500).
*   **Expected Return:** -11.0% (Negative expected return compared to S&P 500 over a 2+ year horizon). This is a significant concern.

    *   Another notes the stock finished 2025 below $600, raising questions about 2026.
    *   An $800 target was set by some analysts, while others mention a potential slip.
