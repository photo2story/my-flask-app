*Note:*  CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  The Alpha and Beta values show significant volatility over time, indicating a high-risk, high-reward investment.  The negative Alphas in some periods suggest underperformance relative to the market.  Market capitalization (Cap) is highly variable.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $551.73
* **Last Market Price:** $569.36 (a $17.63 increase from previous close indicating a sharp, recent upturn)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $563.90
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $564.82
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $560.44

The recent price shows a sharp increase, exceeding all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  However, this needs to be viewed against the longer-term trends.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 53.76 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.543 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -14.4% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -17.1% (Expected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term, according to provided data)

The recent price increase is counter to the bearish PPO and the negative expected return. Further investigation into the reasons for the price surge is recommended. The relatively low MRI, however, suggests a relatively low risk factor.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |

| 2024-02-06 | -0.39    | -0.08        | -0.31       |

Recent earnings show some inconsistencies. While the most recent quarters show positive surprises (EPS exceeding expectations), the earlier quarters and projected EPS for the future are more pessimistic.

| Quarter     | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $4.24       | 32.25%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $3.99       | 31.09%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $3.81       | 29.21%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.64       | 27.61%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.67       | 26.70%        |

**Table 3: Capital and Profitability**

| Quarter     | Equity (B)  | ROE (%)      |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $5.53       | 6.64         |
| 2024-09-30 | $4.63       | 6.48         |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.26       | 6.43         |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.31       | 5.95         |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.52       | -2.77        |

Revenue shows steady growth, while profit margins are also increasing.  Equity and ROE have also shown positive growth in the last year.  However, the negative ROE in 2023-12-31 is a cause for concern.


**6.  Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has demonstrated significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 historically.  However, the recent financial data reveals mixed signals. While revenue and profitability are improving, recent earnings have been inconsistent, and the long-term expected return is negative. The recent sharp price increase needs further investigation to determine if it is sustainable.  The high volatility indicated by the Alpha and Beta analysis, along with the conflicting indicators (positive recent price action but negative expected return), makes SPOT a high-risk investment. Investors should carefully consider the risks before investing, particularly given the potential for significant drawdowns in the past. Further in-depth analysis, including competitive landscape and future growth projections, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
