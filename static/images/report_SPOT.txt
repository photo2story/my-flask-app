**7. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify shows significant long-term growth potential, as evidenced by its substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent performance indicates short-term bearish trends and considerable volatility. The technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook, while the mixed earnings results and fluctuating ROE raise concerns about the company's profitability and consistency.  A thorough analysis of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high relative divergence to the S&P 500 should be treated cautiously, as this is a relative metric and doesn't guarantee future returns. Long-term investors might consider the risk/reward profile carefully before committing significant capital, given the volatility and the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500.
