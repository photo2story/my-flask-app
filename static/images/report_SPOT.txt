## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Investment Review

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify Technology SA is a digital music, podcast, and video streaming service provider.

The cumulative return of SPOT is 197.85%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 105.35%.  The difference is 92.5%, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  However, this high relative performance needs to be considered in the context of the significant volatility shown in the CAGR and MDD data below.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant volatility in SPOT's performance relative to the market (beta) and excess returns above the market (alpha).  While alpha is consistently positive, suggesting outperformance, the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates wildly, indicating high risk.  The maximum drawdown (MDD) is also substantial, highlighting the potential for significant losses.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) also shows fluctuation.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2018-2020  | 93.0% | 12.8% | 54.0% | 0.1 | 65.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 47.0% | 16.6% | -27.0% | 0.1 | 48.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -45.0% | 31.3% | -56.0% | 0.1 | 16.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -76.0% | 31.3% | -101.0% | 0.1 | 39.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 185.0% | 31.3% | 144.0% | 0.1 | 101.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 493.32
* **Last Market Price:** 501.23 (This suggests a recent slight dip)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 480.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 451.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 396.71

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend. However, the relatively large gap between the 5-day and 20-day averages indicates recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 77.90 –  This suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.038 – A positive value suggests upward momentum, but it's relatively low.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (-) – This indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** -20.6% – This suggests a negative expected return relative to the market over the long term (2+ years).  This is contrary to the cumulative performance shown in point 1. More data may be needed to reconcile this discrepancy.
* **501.23 vs. Closing Price:** The last market price of 501.23 is slightly higher than the closing price of 493.32. This small difference does not suggest a significant price jump or drop.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a positive trend in EPS (Earnings Per Share) over the past few quarters, with notable beats over expectations in the last three quarters.

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|--------|-------------|------------|
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61   | 1.88         | Miss       |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33   | 1.06         | Beat       |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.97   | 0.65         | Beat       |
| 2024-02-06 | -0.39  | -0.08        | Miss       |
| 2023-10-24 | 0.33   | -0.22        | Beat       |

**Key observations:**

* **EPS Trend:**  EPS has shown significant improvement, moving from a negative value to positive values in a relatively short period.
* **Beats and Misses:** While there have been significant beats against expectations, the most recent quarter showed a miss, potentially highlighting some uncertainty.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a consistent upward trend, while profit margins are also increasing, indicating improved efficiency.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has significantly increased, and ROE (Return on Equity) has improved considerably, indicating improved profitability and financial health. The negative ROE in Q4 2023 should be noted and investigated further.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Earnings News:**  The provided data includes the most recent earnings reports but lacks details on accompanying news releases or market reaction.  Further research into news releases related to these earnings reports is required.
* **Market Outlook:**  Requires further research.
* **Analyst Opinions:** Requires further research.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, particularly over the past year, however this has been accompanied by considerable volatility.  The recent earnings show generally positive momentum with increasing revenue and profitability.  Technical indicators (RSI) suggest the stock may be overbought, and the expected return is negative, suggesting caution.  The significant volatility, as reflected in both the CAGR and MDD data, along with the conflicting signals from the expected return and the cumulative return highlights a high-risk, high-reward investment profile.  Further research into recent news, analyst opinions and the market outlook is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The considerable discrepancy between the provided long-term expected return and the high recent cumulative returns needs to be addressed and explained before a more confident assessment can be made.
