## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Stock Review

This report analyzes Spotify Technology SA (SPOT), a leading global music streaming service provider, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference is 169.23% - 92.77% = 76.46%.  The relative divergence of 87.3% indicates that Spotify's performance has been considerably better than the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, placing it in the top 87.3% of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, the provided CAGR data shows significant volatility and periods of negative returns, highlighting the risk associated with this outperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $448.65
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $474.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $479.82
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $421.01

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the 5 and 20-day moving averages indicates a recent price drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (38.71):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity, but it's not definitively bullish.
* **PPO (-1.44):**  Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-4.7%):**  Indicates a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (-14.8%):**  The projected long-term (2+ years) underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is concerning.  The current price of $448.65, significantly below recent moving averages, aligns with this negative outlook.  There is no evidence of a rapid price movement (either up or down) from the data provided.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The reported EPS has shown significant volatility.  While there have been positive surprises against expectations in recent quarters (e.g., Q2 2024 and Q1 2024 EPS exceeded expectations), the overall trend is erratic, with a significant loss in Q4 2023.  The consistent increase in EPS starting from Q4 2023 is encouraging, but the single data point doesn't reflect a solidified upward trend.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Shows a generally upward trend, indicating consistent revenue growth.
* **Profit Margin:**  Has steadily increased over the past year.
* **Equity:**  Significantly increased across the last few quarters
* **ROE:**  Shows improvement with a positive ROE in the last two quarters after a negative ROE in Q4 2023.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information on recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions was provided.  This significantly limits the overall assessment and should be supplemented with additional research.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify's stock has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 historically.  However, recent price action, technical indicators (RSI, PPO, and moving averages), and the projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns. While revenue and profit margin are increasing,  the erratic EPS trend and absence of recent news require further investigation.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions significantly hinders a comprehensive analysis.  A more in-depth look at the underlying business factors, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is crucial for a complete assessment.  Currently, based on the limited provided data, the stock appears risky, despite historical outperformance.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.
