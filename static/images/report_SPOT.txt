The low beta consistently around 0.1 indicates low correlation with the market.

**7. Summary and Conclusion:**

Spotify has demonstrated strong recent performance, significantly outpacing the S&P 500.  Revenue and profit margins are showing positive trends, and ROE is improving. However, the negative long-term expected return and recent negative PPO raise concerns.  The volatile EPS history and high MDD in the latest Alpha/Beta analysis also warrant caution. Investors should closely monitor upcoming earnings reports, analyst opinions, and news events to assess Spotify's long-term prospects. The current market price, being slightly below short-term moving averages, could present a short-term buying opportunity if the broader market conditions are favorable.  However, a comprehensive investment decision requires further research and consideration of individual risk tolerance.
