|------------|-------|-------------|------------|
| 2025-04-29 | 1.13  | 2.37        | -1.24       |

| Quarter     | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|------------|---------|
| 2025-03-31  | $4.19       | 31.65%        | $6.25      | 3.60    |
| 2024-12-31  | $4.24       | 32.25%        | $5.53      | 6.64    |
| 2024-09-30  | $3.99       | 31.09%        | $4.63      | 6.48    |
| 2024-06-30  | $3.81       | 29.21%        | $4.26      | 6.43    |
| 2024-03-31  | $3.64       | 27.61%        | $3.31      | 5.95    |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

SPOT's performance has been volatile, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the long term but experiencing periods of substantial underperformance.  Technical indicators suggest a short-term upward trend, but the RSI is approaching overbought territory, cautioning against excessive optimism.  While the financials show healthy revenue and profit margins, recent earnings have been mixed.  The high beta indicates significant market risk.  A long-term investment strategy with careful risk management would be prudent. The negative expected return (-9.7%) is likely due to short term market conditions.  The long-term outperformance of the S&P 500 indicates a potential for positive returns over a longer investment horizon (2 years or more).  Further investigation into the drivers of EPS variance and the sustainability of the high growth seen in recent quarters is crucial before making any investment decisions.
