**Company Overview:**  Spot is a leading provider of financial technology solutions, specializing in payment processing, foreign exchange, and treasury management.

**Performance Analysis:**

1. **Relative Performance:** SPOT has outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by **23.95%**, with a relative outperformance of **49.63%** compared to its historical range. This indicates that SPOT has been performing better than the broader market, though it is currently near the midpoint of its historical relative performance range.

2. **Recent Price Trend:**
    * **Closing Price:** $322.77
    * **5-Day Moving Average:** $330.43
    * **20-Day Moving Average:** $337.38
    * **60-Day Moving Average:** $323.11

    SPOT's price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, the price is close to the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support at this level. 

3. **Technical Indicators:**
    * **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 35.88
    * **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.83
    * **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -5.99 (Short-term downward trend)
    * **Expected Return:** 65.61% (Maximum expected return over 5 years)

    The RSI and PPO values are both below their neutral levels, suggesting potential oversold conditions. The negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence confirms a short-term downward trend, but the high Expected Return suggests a potential for future growth. 

4. **Earnings Analysis:**

    | Date | EPS | Estimated EPS |
    |---|---|---|
    | 2024-07-23 | 1.33 | 1.06 |

    | 2023-10-24 | 0.33 | -0.22 |
    | 2023-07-25 | -1.69 | -0.8 |

    SPOT's most recent earnings results (2024-07-23) were significantly higher than estimated, demonstrating a strong performance. This positive trend has been consistent over the past few quarters, with SPOT exceeding expectations consistently.

**Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown strong relative performance compared to the S&P 500, coupled with positive recent earnings results and a high expected return. While the current price trend is downward, the indicators suggest potential oversold conditions and a strong future outlook. Investors should carefully consider the short-term downtrend and potential support at the 60-day moving average before making any investment decisions.
