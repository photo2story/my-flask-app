## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify Technology SA is a digital music, podcast, and video streaming service provider.

The cumulative return of SPOT is 190.29%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 98.77%.  The difference is 91.5%, placing it at the 95.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data's maximum and minimum deviations.  This indicates strong relative performance, though past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values, all with a beta close to 1, suggesting high correlation with the overall market.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and maximum drawdown (MDD) figures are highly volatile, indicating significant risk.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying drivers of these fluctuations.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $487.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $483.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $465.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $451.56

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The recent price change of $0.41 (0.08%) is relatively small and doesn't signal a significant jump or drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 63.86.  This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but approaching overbought territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.52. A positive value indicates upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +4.9%, indicating short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -12%. This suggests that, despite the strong recent performance relative to the S&P 500, the long-term expected return is below that of the S&P 500.  This warrants further investigation into the reasons behind this negative expectation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility. While some quarters exceeded expectations (Q2, Q1, and Q4 2024), others fell short (Q3 2024 and previous quarters).  The significant negative EPS in Q1 2024 needs further analysis to understand the underlying cause. The consistent beat on earnings expectations in recent quarters however is a positive sign.

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|---------------|------------|
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61   | 1.88          | -0.27      |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33   | 1.06          | +0.27      |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.97   | 0.65          | +0.32      |
| 2024-02-06 | -0.39  | -0.08         | -0.31      |
| 2023-10-24 | 0.33   | -0.22         | +0.55      |


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is steadily increasing, and profit margins show a consistent upward trend. This is a positive sign, indicating strong financial health.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has grown significantly, and ROE (Return on Equity) has improved, although it dipped into negative territory in Q4 2023.  This warrants further investigation into the causes of the negative ROE.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT shows strong short-term relative performance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by its high cumulative return and positive technical indicators. However, the long-term expected return is negative relative to the market, and the historical data reveals significant volatility in both earnings and price.  The recent positive earnings surprises are encouraging, but a thorough analysis of the causes of the negative ROE and the Q1 2024 EPS loss is crucial.  Investors should consider the inherent risk involved in this stock given its volatility and the conflicting signals regarding long-term performance. Further due diligence, including an analysis of the company's competitive landscape, growth prospects, and macroeconomic factors, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
