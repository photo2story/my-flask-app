**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent performance has been poor.  The stock is currently trading below its key moving averages and shows signs of being oversold (RSI).  While recent earnings show improvement, they still lag expectations in some quarters. The high risk MRI indicator and negative expected return highlight significant short-term downside risk.  Long-term prospects depend on whether Spotify can maintain revenue growth and improve profitability, especially in the context of increasing competition in the streaming market.  The substantial historical volatility makes a long-term investment decision dependent on risk tolerance.  More detailed fundamental analysis would be needed to accurately assess long-term potential and compare it to the S&P 500.
