## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Stock Report

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Spotify Technology SA is a digital music, podcast, and video streaming service provider.  The provided data shows a significantly higher cumulative return for SPOT compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  However, this high return is also accompanied by high volatility and risk, as indicated by the substantial maximum drawdown (MDD) figures and fluctuating alpha and beta.

**1) Cumulative Return Comparison:**

* **SPOT Cumulative Return:** 276.84%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.25%
* **Return Difference:** 176.6%  (Relative Divergence: 97.8%)

SPOT has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.  However, the high relative divergence indicates this outperformance is at the extreme end of historical performance, suggesting a potentially unsustainable level.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $638.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $637.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $569.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $504.26

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting upward momentum in the short-term.  However, the significant gap between the 5-day and 60-day averages indicates considerable price volatility.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 83.98 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 0.74 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.0% (Slight downward pressure recently)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -10.8%

The high RSI suggests the stock is overbought, implying a potential pullback.  The positive PPO reinforces the short-term bullish momentum.  However, the long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500, indicating potential underperformance over a longer investment horizon (2+ years). The negative expected return needs further investigation to understand what underlying factors contribute to this prediction.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.88     | 2.06        | -0.18       |
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61     | 1.88        | -0.27       |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33     | 1.06        | +0.27       |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.97     | 0.65        | +0.32       |
| 2024-02-06 | -0.39    | -0.08       | -0.31       |

Recent earnings have shown some volatility, with a few quarters missing expectations and others exceeding them.  Consistent underperformance against expectations warrants further investigation into the company's performance and guidance.


**5) Financial Information:**

No 'Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit' data is available.  This lack of crucial financial information significantly limits a comprehensive analysis of SPOT's financial health and growth prospects. This is a major deficiency in the provided dataset.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by substantial volatility and risk.  Technical indicators suggest potential short-term corrections due to overbought conditions.  The long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500.  The absence of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) severely hampers a complete assessment.  Investors should exercise caution, carefully consider the high risk, and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in SPOT, especially considering the contradictory signals from short-term performance and long-term expected returns. Further investigation into the reasons for the negative long-term expected return and the missing financial data is crucial before making any investment decisions.
