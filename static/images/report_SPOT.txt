*   **Analysis:** The Alpha, Beta analysis shows a mixed performance for SPOT over different periods. Key observations:
    *   **CAGR Volatility:** High volatility in Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) across the periods, ranging from -56% to +122%.  This indicates SPOT's performance is highly sensitive to the specific time frame considered.
    *   **High MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) around 78-79% signifies significant risk and potential for large losses.
    *   **Inconsistent Alpha:** Alpha values vary widely, reflecting periods of significant outperformance and underperformance compared to the market. The recent years (2022-2025) show strong Alpha, suggesting SPOT is currently generating returns above what would be expected based on its risk profile.
    *   **Low Beta:** The Beta consistently hovers around zero, indicating that SPOT's price is not closely correlated with the overall market. This is rather unusual, and may be skewing the other measures.
    *   **Cap(B):** Cap fluctuates, showing that it is sensitive to external factors.

**2. Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **5-day SMA:** 578.32
*   **20-day SMA:** 608.85
*   **60-day SMA:** 660.55

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This suggests a short-term downward trend.  The recent price increase on the last day of the market (price up from previousClose) offers a glimmer of hope, but needs to be sustained to reverse the trend.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 15.37 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.66

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -3.1 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -16.0% (Negative expected excess return compared to S&P 500 over 2 years)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A "Medium Investment" recommendation implies moderate risk.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI is extremely low, indicating that the stock is oversold. This *could* suggest a potential for a rebound, but it's not a guarantee.
    *   **PPO:** The negative PPO confirms the downward trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is recommending a buy based on a safe, medium-risk profile.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The declining relative divergence suggests that the stock's underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is worsening.
    *   **Expected Return:** The negative expected return is a red flag. It suggests that, based on the current analysis, the model anticipates Spotify to underperform the S&P 500 over the next two years.
