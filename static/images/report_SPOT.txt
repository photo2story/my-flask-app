**Analysis:**

*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha fluctuates wildly, reflecting periods of both substantial outperformance and underperformance relative to a benchmark. The last two years show significant positive Alpha.
*   **Beta:** Beta is consistently near zero, meaning that, historically, the stock has not shown a clear correlation with the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 584.35
*   **Last Market Data:** Price = 581.19, Previous Close = 584.35, Change = -0.54
*   **5-day SMA:** 582.25
*   **20-day SMA:** 579.74
*   **60-day SMA:** 626.44

**Analysis:** SPOT's current price is slightly below its 5-day and 20-day SMAs, but significantly below its 60-day SMA. This suggests a potential short-term downward trend, with a possible period of growth in the past. The recent price decrease (-0.54) and short-term SMAs being lower than long-term SMAs support this.

**3) Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 57.73 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.52
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash 0%, Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** -3.1 (Indicates a short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -15.7% (Negative expected excess return compared to the S&P 500).

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. The RSI indicates a neutral market position for SPOT. The Hybrid Signal recommends a significant buy. However, the negative expected return is a major red flag. The recent decrease in relative divergence reinforces the short-term downward trend seen in the SMAs.

*   **Opinions:** 39
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 755.94 / 902.54 / 502.06
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not available.

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and a significantly higher average target price than the current price. This suggests analysts see considerable upside potential.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Overall, Spotify presents a mixed picture.

*   **Positives:** SPOT has outperformed the S&P 500 recently, with significant positive Alpha, and analysts are generally optimistic with a "Buy" consensus and a high target price, earnings beats, price hikes, and positive performance in 2025. The Hybrid Signal also gives a "Buy" signal.
*   **Negatives:** Recent data suggests a short-term downward trend. The Expected Return is negative. The negative shift on divergence, and the mixed news sentiment raises concerns, including analyst downgrades. The high MDD indicates substantial risk.

**Conclusion:**

Despite the overall positive cumulative return and analyst sentiment, the recent price action, negative expected return, and high volatility warrant caution. The "Buy" recommendation from the Hybrid Signal is contradicted by the negative Expected Return and downward trend of SMAs. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing in Spotify. The negative expected return is particularly concerning.
