**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data was provided, hindering a comprehensive financial analysis. This is a significant limitation to a thorough evaluation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown remarkable historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent performance indicators suggest caution.  The high relative divergence,  mixed alpha values, high volatility, and negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns. The absence of key financial data further limits a complete assessment. While the recent price action shows a short-term uptrend, the RSI suggests potential for a pullback.  A thorough analysis requires access to more comprehensive financial statements and a deeper understanding of the company's long-term growth prospects. The current data paints a picture of a high-growth, high-risk investment, with significant potential rewards but also significant potential for losses.  Investors should conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions.
