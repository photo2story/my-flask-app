**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify's cumulative return (172.54%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (92.69%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 79.8%, placing it in the 89th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided relative divergence metric.  This suggests strong outperformance, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in Spotify's performance year-over-year, ranging from a high of 162% to a low of -75%. The Beta values fluctuate, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements. Alpha values are consistently around 0.1, suggesting some degree of outperformance relative to the market, but these figures need to be considered within the context of the risk (Beta) associated with this performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last reported closing price of $454.16, SPOT's price is below its 5-day ($469.08), 20-day ($479.03), and 60-day ($422.18) moving averages. This suggests a recent downward trend in the short-term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (40.62):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential for a short-term rebound, but it's not a definitive buy signal.
* **PPO (-1.57):**  Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent -4.7% change in relative strength indicates a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (-14.1%):**  The negative expected return suggests that the market anticipates underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is likely already factored into the current valuation. The given current price ($454.16) does not suggest a significant event-driven price movement like a sudden jump or drop, given the context of the other indicators.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

While the company beat expectations in several quarters (e.g., Q2 and Q1 2024), it also significantly missed expectations in Q4 2023 and had a net loss in Q4 2024.  The trend shows an increase in earnings in the first and second quarter 2024, before a fall back in later quarters, requiring additional analysis for a comprehensive understanding. The reported EPS numbers are not consistently positive, indicating some challenges in earnings consistency.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify's strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is notable, but its recent price action and mixed earnings performance paint a more complex picture.

Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term rebound, but the long-term outlook is uncertain based on the provided data.  A thorough review of recent news and developments is critical for informed investment decision-making.  The high relative divergence against the S&P 500 is noteworthy, but it must be weighed against the risks indicated by other metrics.
