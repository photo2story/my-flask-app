## Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Spotify Technology SA (SPOT), a leading digital music streaming service provider, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference is 190.98% - 100.18% = 90.80%.  The provided relative divergence of 94.7% indicates SPOT's performance is in the top 94.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this does not indicate future outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta data show significant volatility in SPOT's performance relative to the market (Beta).  While some periods show strong alpha (outperformance), others show significant underperformance (-75% CAGR from 2021-2023). This highlights the risk associated with investing in SPOT.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $484.90
* **Last Market Price:** $479.56

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $479.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $418.12

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent stability. However, it is significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a recent price increase.  The difference between the Last Market Price and Closing Price is negligible.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** -0.93 – Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +0.4 – Short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -14.3% –  This suggests a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This should be interpreted cautiously as it's only a projection.

Given the Last Market price of $479.56 is not significantly different from the closing price, no conclusions regarding a rapid increase or decrease are drawn.

The provided data does not contain any news or recent market outlook information within the last two days.  Analyst opinions are also missing.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify exhibits strong revenue growth and improving profitability.  However, its stock price volatility and the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 (though this projection should be viewed with caution) present significant risk. While recent earnings have shown improvement and beaten expectations in some cases, the long-term outlook warrants careful consideration. The high relative divergence against the S&P 500 is noteworthy but needs to be considered in conjunction with other risk factors.  Further information on news, analyst sentiment and broader market conditions would be needed for a more comprehensive analysis.
