Here's a comprehensive analysis of Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) based on the provided data, presented in a report format.

**Spotify Technology SA (SPOT) Investment Report**

**1. Performance Overview & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO)**

Spotify Technology SA is a digital music, podcast, and video streaming service provider.

The cumulative return for SPOT is 203.94%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 100.57%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 103.37%. This places SPOT at the maximum observed relative divergence of 100% compared to the historical range of its performance relative to the S&P 500.  While this suggests superior performance, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The high relative divergence also warrants a closer examination of the underlying factors driving this outperformance.  The provided alpha and beta analysis provides further insight into this performance relative to the market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a fluctuating alpha and beta over the analyzed periods. While alpha generally remains around 0.1, indicating some degree of outperformance relative to the market, the beta fluctuates considerably, suggesting substantial market sensitivity (particularly the high beta values for periods including 2018-2020 and 2022-2024). The high negative alpha in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 aligns with the broader market downturn during that period. The sharp increase in CAGR and alpha in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 indicates a significant recovery and outperformance in the more recent period.  Market capitalization also varies significantly throughout the analyzed periods.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2018-2020  | 92.0% | 12.7% | 54.0% | 0.1 | 63.6 |
| 2019-2021  | 45.0% | 16.6% | -26.0% | 0.1 | 47.3 |
| 2020-2022  | -47.0% | 31.2% | -56.0% | 0.1 | 15.9 |
| 2021-2023  | -75.0% | 31.2% | -98.0% | 0.1 | 38.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 158.0% | 31.2% | 125.0% | 0.1 | 90.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 232.0% | 5.8% | 169.0% | 0.1 | 103.2 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $510.43
* **5-day Moving Average:** $495.71
* **20-day Moving Average:** $472.68
* **60-day Moving Average:** $457.73

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The recent price increase of 1.78% from the previous close indicates a short-term upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 72.82  (Approaching overbought territory; caution warranted)
* **PPO:** 0.81 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +1.8 (Short-term upward trend confirmed)

The recent price change (1.78%) doesn't suggest a drastic move (neither a significant spike nor a sudden drop). The expected return of -10.5% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is notable. This implies a potential underperformance compared to the broader market in the long run, despite the current strong relative performance.  Further investigation into the factors contributing to this negative expected return is crucial.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters, apart from Q1 2024 and Q4 2023.  The significant positive surprise in Q2 and Q3 2024 is a positive signal.

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Surprise |
|------------|--------|--------------|----------|
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61   | 1.88          | -0.27     |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33   | 1.06          | +0.27     |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.97   | 0.65          | +0.32     |
| 2024-02-06 | -0.39  | -0.08         | -0.31     |
| 2023-10-24 | 0.33   | -0.22         | +0.55     |

|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $4.63B | 6.48% |
| 2024-06-30 | $4.26B | 6.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.31B | 5.95% |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.52B | -2.77% |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.14B | 3.04% |


**7. Overall Conclusion:**

SPOT's recent performance has been strong, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, the long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative.  The high relative divergence to the S&P 500 should be viewed cautiously and warrants more in-depth analysis considering the volatility in beta and the fluctuation in alpha across the different periods.  While recent earnings have generally been positive, the negative ROE in Q4 2023 and the mixed earnings beat/miss in recent quarters require careful scrutiny. Further investigation into the underlying drivers of both the short-term outperformance and the projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is essential before making any investment decisions.  A thorough examination of the company's future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and potential risks is crucial.  The high RSI also suggests caution.  Considering the current data alone, it is difficult to make a definitive buy/sell/hold recommendation.  Further due diligence is strongly advised.
