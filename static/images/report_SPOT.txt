**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Spotify Technology SA is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider.  The cumulative return of SPOT is 176.06%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 91.15%. The difference is 84.9%, placing it in the 91.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates strong outperformance compared to the broader market.  However, the provided alpha and beta analysis show fluctuating performance and high volatility.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) data reveals significant volatility in SPOT's performance relative to the S&P 500 (as indicated by the Beta values around 0.1, implying low correlation). While recent periods (2022-2025) show exceptionally high CAGR, earlier periods experienced substantial losses.  This highlights the inherent risk in investing in SPOT.

Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape, is strongly recommended.
