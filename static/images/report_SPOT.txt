**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 475.04 (Last Market: 475.31)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 466.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 422.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 381.58

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, the relatively large gap between the current price and the longer-term moving averages indicates potential for a correction.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (83.88):**  Extremely overbought, suggesting a high probability of a price correction.
* **PPO (1.01):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):**  +25.16, confirms the recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (-0.02%):**  The model projects a slightly negative return.  This is likely a short-term projection and doesn't reflect the long-term potential outlined in the next point.  The 475.31 price is not exceptionally high to trigger a "sudden surge" flag.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The earnings show a mixed picture. While recent quarters have shown positive EPS exceeding expectations, earlier quarters displayed losses.  The most recent quarter (2024-11-12) shows a positive EPS of 1.61, slightly below the expected EPS of 1.88.  This suggests a slight disappointment in the market's expectations.

|--------------|----------|---------------|---------|-------|
| 2024-09-30  | $3.99B   | 31.09%        | $4.63B  | 6.48% |

**8. Overall Analysis:**

SPOT shows strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500 but exhibits considerable volatility.  Recent price action is bullish in the short term, indicated by the moving averages and relative strength. However, the overbought RSI and the negative expected return signal caution.  The recent earnings were mixed, with some positive surprises but also some misses on expectations.  The financial information points to consistent revenue growth and generally positive profitability, though the ROE needs further investigation.  A thorough analysis of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial to form a complete picture.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy, taking into account the inherent risks, might be considered if the long-term outlook remains positive post news analysis.
