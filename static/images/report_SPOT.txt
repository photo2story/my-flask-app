*   **SPOT Overview:** Spotify Technology SA is a music streaming service that provides on-demand audio content.
*   **SPOT Cumulative Return:** 101.57%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 83.61%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current:** 18.0
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 46.9 (Indicates Spotify's performance relative to the S&P 500 is currently near the middle of its historical range)
*   **Analysis:** Spotify has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, with a higher cumulative return. The relative divergence suggests that while Spotify has done well, its outperformance is not currently at the extreme high end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | 100.0% | 79.0%  | 16.0%  | -0.0  | 119.7  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 100.0% - Very high growth rate projected.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 79.0% - High level of risk, indicating a potential for large losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** 16.0% - Positive alpha suggests outperformance compared to the market benchmark (risk-adjusted).
*   **Beta:** -0.0 - Indicates almost no correlation with the market, suggesting SPOT's returns are independent of overall market movements, or it is a miscalculation.
*   **Cap(B):** 119.7 - Market capitalization in billions.

**Analysis:** The data suggests high growth potential but also significant risk. The positive alpha is encouraging. The low beta is unusual and warrants further investigation to understand SPOT's relationship with the broader market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 576.68
*   **Last Market Data:** Price = 581.37, Previous Close = 576.68, Change = 0.81
*   **5-day SMA:** 581.64
*   **20-day SMA:** 578.87
*   **60-day SMA:** 622.61

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term downward trend. The 5-day SMA is slightly higher than the 20-day SMA, which could signal a minor recent recovery attempt.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 44.02 - Neutral, not overbought or oversold.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.42 - Indicates that the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, suggesting a mild uptrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-09) - Suggests a strong buy signal based on a model that considers safety and market risk. The recommended cash allocation is 0%, indicating a fully invested position.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -0.7 (Negative) - Short-term decline in relative divergence (underperformance compared to the S&P 500).
*   **Recent Price Fluctuation:** The increase from the previous close (576.68 to 581.37) indicates a small rebound.
*   **Expected Return:** -15.7% - Negative expected return, suggesting a potential for losses if investing at the current price point based on the model's predictions. This is in comparison to the excess return compared to S&P 500
**Analysis:** The MRI indicates a generally favorable investment environment. RSI suggests there is still more room to go upward and the PPO suggests a mild uptrend. However, the negative expected return is concerning, potentially indicating overvaluation, and the short-term decline in divergence signals recent underperformance. The Hybrid Signal is conflicting, strongly suggesting a buy.
