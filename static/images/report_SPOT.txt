This report analyzes the performance of Spotify Technology SA (SPOT), a leading global music streaming service provider, comparing its returns against the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Spotify's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-11-12 | 1.61     | 1.88         |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.33     | 1.06         |

| 2023-10-24 | 0.33     | -0.22        |

Recent earnings have been mixed. While some quarters have exceeded expectations (Q2 and Q1 2024), others have fallen short (Q4 2023, Q4 2024).  The negative EPS in Q1 2024 is a concern, but it's important to view this within the context of the company's overall financial health and long-term growth prospects.

**Capital and Profitability:**

|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | $4.63       | 6.48    |

| 2023-09-30  | $2.14       | 3.04    |

Equity is increasing, and ROE is generally positive, indicating profitability.  The negative ROE in Q4 2023 is notable and warrants further investigation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

SPOT has shown exceptionally high cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500. However, this performance has been volatile, with periods of significant losses.  Current technical indicators (RSI) suggest the stock is overbought, implying potential for a correction. While financial statements show generally positive growth in revenue and profitability, some quarters have underperformed expectations, and some key metrics such as ROE have shown volatility.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 highlights a significant risk associated with investing in SPOT.  Further research into the drivers of the company's earnings variability and future growth projections is needed before making any investment decision.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in SPOT.
