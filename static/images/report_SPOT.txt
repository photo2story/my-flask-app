**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD Table:**

|            Year | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|       2019-2021 | 73.0%  | 81.2%  | -3.0%  | 0.8    | 48.2   |
|       2020-2022 | -44.0% | 85.1%  | -63.0% | 1.1    | 16.3   |
|       2021-2023 | -40.0% | 85.1%  | -69.0% | 1.7    | 38.7   |
|       2022-2024 | 128.0% | 79.0%  | 98.0%  | 1.6    | 92.1   |
|       2023-2025 | 415.0% | 79.3%  | 347.0% | 1.1    | 119.6  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Highly variable.  Significant growth in 2019-2021 and especially 2023-2025, but large negative CAGR in 2020-2023 periods. This suggests volatile performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High drawdowns consistently around 80%, indicate substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is mostly negative except for the last period (2022-2024 and 2023-2025). This indicates that for the periods where alpha is negative, Spotify has underperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.  The most recent period, 2023-2025 shows a dramatic outperformance (347%).
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally above 1, indicating that SPOT is more volatile than the S&P 500. The 2021-2023 period shows a higher beta of 1.7, indicating increased sensitivity to market movements during that time.
*   **Cap(B) - Market Capitalization (Billions):** Market cap has increased over the period, showing the company's growth.

**In summary:** Spotify has outperformed the S&P 500 cumulatively, but with significant volatility and periods of underperformance relative to its benchmark (negative alpha). The high MDD figures highlight the risk. The recent period (2023-2025) shows strong growth and outperformance, but this needs to be considered in light of the overall risk profile.
