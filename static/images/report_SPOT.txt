**6. Overall Analysis:**

Spotify has shown significant historical outperformance against the S&P 500, but this is coupled with high volatility. While recent earnings show improvement and a positive trend in revenue and profitability, the high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and susceptible to a correction.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the longer term warrants caution.  Investors should carefully consider the risk associated with SPOT's volatility before making any investment decisions. Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the drivers of recent price movement and future growth prospects, is recommended.
