## ETH-USD Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

ETH-USD, representing Ethereum, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.  The analysis below shows a significant outperformance against the S&P 500 (VOO) historically, though recent performance has been negative.  Current indicators suggest a medium risk profile with potential for future growth, though considerable volatility is expected.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **ETH-USD Cumulative Return:** 238.03%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 38.33%
* **Return Difference:** 199.7%
* **Relative Divergence:** 14.2% (This means the current difference between ETH-USD and VOO's cumulative returns is at the 14.2nd percentile of the historical range of differences between the two assets.)

The table below shows a high degree of volatility in ETH-USD's performance, with significant year-over-year swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and high maximum drawdown (MDD).  Alpha values suggest periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (as represented by beta).  The high beta values consistently indicate ETH-USD's price is highly sensitive to market movements.

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD   | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -48.0%     | 70.3% | -65.0% | -0.0  | 15.3    |
| 2018-2020  | 217.0%    | 70.3% | 190.0% | -0.0  | 86.9    |
| 2019-2021  | 1244.0%   | 57.7% | 1199.0%| -0.1  | 433.8   |
| 2020-2022  | 320.0%    | 70.4% | 316.0% | -0.1  | 141.2   |
| 2021-2023  | -226.0%   | 70.4% | -238.0%| 0.4   | 271.0   |
| 2022-2024  | -261.0%   | 74.4% | -275.0%| 0.3   | 392.5   |
| 2023-2025  | -207.0%   | 74.4% | -218.0%| 0.3   | 191.1   |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 1622.77
* **Last Market Price:** 1583.67
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 1590.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 1736.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 2082.34

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price change (-2.43) indicates a slight decline from the previous close, representing a small negative market reaction.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.79 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so)
* **PPO:** 0.021 (Slightly positive, suggesting a weak bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 2772.6% (This is a very high expected return and should be treated with caution.  It likely reflects historical high volatility and should not be taken as a guaranteed forecast.)

The indicators present a mixed picture. The RSI is close to the oversold region, suggesting potential for a bounce. The positive PPO and rising relative divergence add to this possibility. However, the price is below its moving averages and the MRI indicates a medium risk level, highlighting the volatility inherent in this asset.  The expected return is exceptionally high, and while it accounts for the possibility of substantial outperformance over the S&P 500 in the long term, it also underscores the considerable risk involved.  The recent price decline of -2.43  is not significant enough to qualify as a "sharp drop."


**Conclusion:**

ETH-USD has historically shown substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, the recent price action suggests a bearish short-term trend. While some indicators point towards a potential rebound, the high volatility and medium risk profile warrant caution.  A long-term investment strategy could potentially yield significant returns but involves substantial risk.  Further research and analysis, including consideration of macroeconomic factors and broader market conditions, are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
