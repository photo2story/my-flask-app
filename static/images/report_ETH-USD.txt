**Report on ETH-USD**

**1. Performance Analysis vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** ETH-USD
*   **Company:** ETH-USD (Represents the price of Ethereum in US Dollars)
*   **Overview:** Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality, used for a wide range of applications including decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs.

*   **Key Numbers:**
    *   ETH-USD Cumulative Return: 283.71%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 77.29%
    *   Absolute Deviation: 207.2 (Max: 740.2, Min: -67.5)
    *   Relative Deviation: 34.0

*   **Analysis:** ETH-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. The cumulative return of ETH-USD is more than three times that of VOO.  The "Relative Deviation" of 34.0 indicates that the current outperformance is in the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This suggests that while ETH-USD is still outperforming, its relative advantage is not as extreme as it has been in the past.
