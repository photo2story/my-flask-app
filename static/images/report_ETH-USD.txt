Analyst Consensus:

**Comprehensive Analysis:**

Based on the provided data, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has a high cumulative return of 172.28%. However, its divergence from the S&P 500 (VOO) is still significant at 97.50. The Alpha, Beta analysis shows varying degrees of performance across different periods, while the recent stock price fluctuations indicate a slight upward trend. The RSI and PPO indicators suggest a relatively high market risk, but the MRI still recommends a medium investment. Recent news and significant events indicate a positive outlook for Ethereum, including a surge to near-record highs and increased investment in the token. However, caution is advised due to the high expected return of 667.60% and the decline in the 7-day Dynamic Expected Return change.
