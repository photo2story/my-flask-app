**Performance Analysis:**

ETH-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return of 483.29% compared to VOO's 99.47%.  The substantial difference (383.83%) highlights ETH-USD's superior performance. However, the relative divergence of 29.5% suggests that while significantly higher, this outperformance is not at an extreme level relative to its historical performance against VOO.


The provided CAGR data shows highly volatile returns, ranging from significant losses to extremely high gains depending on the specific time period.  The high beta values (especially in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024) suggest high sensitivity to market movements.  The alpha values generally show some outperformance relative to the market. However, these figures should be viewed cautiously given the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market.  Market capitalization changes reflect the volatility in the crypto market.


**Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $2740.39
* **Last Market Price:** $2684.63
* **5-day Moving Average:** $2706.40
* **20-day Moving Average:** $2729.72
* **60-day Moving Average:** $3138.18

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a potential short-term downtrend.  The recent price increase from the previous close ($2660.69 to $2684.63) is relatively small (0.9%) and does not indicate a significant rapid uptrend.



**Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (53.69):**  Suggests a neutral market condition.  While not showing overbought conditions, it's not strongly suggesting a bullish trend either.
* **PPO (0.81):** A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum.

The recent relative divergence change of -0.1 suggests a slight weakening of the relative strength of ETH-USD compared to VOO over the last 20 days.


**Expected Return and Risk:**

The projected long-term (2+ years) expected return of 964.9% compared to the S&P 500 is substantial.  However, it's crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. This high expected return comes with considerably higher risk than investing in the S&P 500.  Past performance is not indicative of future results, and investing in ETH-USD involves significant risk of substantial losses.  Thorough research and risk tolerance assessment are essential before any investment decision.
