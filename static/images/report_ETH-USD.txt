## ETH-USD Investment Report

**1. Performance Analysis:**

ETH-USD, representing Ether, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).

The cumulative return of ETH-USD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns is 748.13% - 98.31% = 649.82%. The relative divergence indicates that ETH-USD's performance is considerably above the S&P 500's, placing it in the upper percentile of historical performance relative to the benchmark.  However,  the provided data shows high volatility with significant periods of both substantial gains and losses (CAGR ranging from -83% to 1201%). The high beta values (0.1 to 16) suggest high sensitivity to market movements, although the relatively low alpha values imply underperformance relative to the market in some periods.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $3911.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $3795.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $3713.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $3118.24

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  However,  the difference between the closing price and the last market price ($3887.01) is relatively small and doesn't indicate a significant recent price jump or drop.

* **RSI:** 62.09 - Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, indicating a relatively neutral momentum.
* **PPO:** -0.69 - A negative value suggests bearish momentum, although not extremely strong.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.2 - Indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 906.6% - This represents a substantial expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500.  This projection should be treated with caution, as it is highly dependent on future market conditions and is not a guaranteed outcome.
