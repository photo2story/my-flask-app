The difference in cumulative returns is a substantial 608.1%, placing its relative divergence at the 44th percentile based on historical data (range: -73.5% to 1475.4%).

**4.  CAGR, MDD, Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

The provided table shows highly variable performance across different time periods. While significant positive CAGR was observed in some periods (e.g., 1201% from 2019-2021), substantial negative returns were also recorded (e.g., -83% from 2017-2019).  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures consistently demonstrate the significant risk involved in holding ETH-USD.

**6.  Overall Analysis:**

ETH-USD has demonstrated exceptionally high returns historically, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this performance comes with extreme volatility, as evidenced by the high MDD figures and fluctuating CAGR.  The negative PPO and the fact that the current price is below the 5-day moving average suggest short-term bearish momentum.  The high expected return should be viewed with caution given the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrencies.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence is crucial, including consideration of the regulatory landscape, technological risks, and potential market corrections. The information provided in point 5 (news and recent issues) is vital for a complete assessment of the current investment climate.  The high beta suggests a strong correlation with overall market sentiment.  Therefore, any broader market downturn would likely negatively impact ETH-USD.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in this highly volatile asset.
