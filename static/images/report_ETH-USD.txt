*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** All periods show a 0.0% CAGR, indicating no growth over these specific intervals.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  A 0.0% MDD across all periods suggests no significant losses during these times. This is unusual and may indicate data issues or that only very specific points were sampled, since that would show the worst loss from a peak to a trough during the period.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently 0.0, implying that ETH-USD did not outperform or underperform its benchmark (VOO) during these periods.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of 1.0 suggests that ETH-USD's volatility is the same as the market (VOO).
*   **Cap(B):** This shows market capitalization in billions, growing significantly from 2017-2021, then fluctuating.  The Cap(B) values indicate a substantial increase in market capitalization, particularly between 2017-2021. This highlights a period of significant growth for ETH-USD. The subsequent fluctuations may reflect market corrections or volatility in the cryptocurrency space.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 2593.499755859375

*   **60-day Moving Average:** 1867.1598

*Analysis:* The price is above all moving averages, indicating an uptrend. However, the recent `change` value suggests a short-term pullback. The 5-day moving average is close to the current price, while the 20 and 60-day moving averages are significantly lower, supporting the overall uptrend.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.0 (Well below any risk threshold)
*   **RSI:** 82.52 (Overbought)

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0 (No projected outperformance vs. S&P 500)

*Analysis:* The RSI indicates that ETH-USD is currently overbought, which often precedes a price correction. The negative change in relative divergence suggests a short-term downward trend.  The low MRI suggests minimal market risk (according to this indicator).  The PPO being positive suggests the short-term moving average is above the long-term, confirming the uptrend.

**5. Overall Analysis**

ETH-USD is currently in an uptrend, as evidenced by its price being above its moving averages. However, the high RSI reading indicates that it may be overbought and due for a correction. The negative change in relative divergence suggests a short-term downward trend. The recent price drop further supports this possibility.

The news headlines suggest that ETH-USD is subject to various market influences, including business developments, regulatory changes, and global economic factors.

**Recommendation:** While the overall trend is positive, the overbought condition and recent pullback warrant caution. Investors should monitor the situation closely and consider taking profits or reducing their positions if the downward trend continues. Further investigation into the specific news events is recommended to assess their potential impact on ETH-USD's future performance.
