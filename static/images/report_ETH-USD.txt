## ETH-USD Investment Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

ETH-USD, representing Ethereum, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO), though recent performance shows a downturn.  Short-term indicators suggest bearish momentum, while long-term projections suggest substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The cumulative return of ETH-USD (231.25%) drastically surpasses that of the S&P 500 (VOO) (42.12%).  The current divergence of 189.1 points places it significantly above its historical range (max: 1805.7, min: -67.9),  resulting in a relative divergence of 13.7%.  This signifies that the current outperformance relative to the S&P 500 falls within the upper percentile of its historical range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals significant volatility and varying performance depending on the period:

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD      | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -48.0%    | 70.3%    | -68.0% | 0.1   | 15.6   |
| 2018-2020  | 217.0%    | 70.3%    | 187.0% | 0.1   | 89.0   |
| 2019-2021  | 1244.0%   | 57.7%    | 1196.0%| 0.1   | 444.5  |
| 2020-2022  | 320.0%    | 70.4%    | 315.0% | 0.1   | 144.7  |
| 2021-2023  | -226.0%   | 70.4%    | -241.0%| 0.4   | 277.7  |
| 2022-2024  | -261.0%   | 74.4%    | -278.0%| 0.4   | 402.2  |
| 2023-2025  | -214.0%   | 74.4%    | -225.0%| 0.3   | 190.3  |


High Beta values (especially in the last three years) indicate significant sensitivity to market movements.  Negative CAGRs in recent years show periods of substantial losses.  Note that Alpha values represent excess returns over the benchmark, but the volatility suggests a high-risk investment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 1576.59
* **Last Market Price:** 1576.76
* **5-day Moving Average:** 1605.64
* **20-day Moving Average:** 1694.04
* **60-day Moving Average:** 2044.77

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The recent price change (-0.76) reflects a small decrease compared to the previous close, but this is not significant enough to characterize as a sharp drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.42 (below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** 0.24 (positive, but relatively low)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.7 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 2860.4% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated for long-term investors)

The technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  The RSI below 50 confirms the bearish momentum, while the positive PPO indicates some upward pressure, albeit weak. The negative 20-day relative divergence change reinforces the short-term bearish trend.  However, the high expected return underscores the potential for long-term growth, far exceeding that of the S&P 500.  The medium market risk further highlights the need to consider the significant volatility.
