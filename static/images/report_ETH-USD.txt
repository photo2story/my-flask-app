## ETH-USD Analysis (vs. S&P 500 - VOO)

**Ticker:** ETH-USD
**Company:** ETH-USD
**Description:** ETH-USD represents the price of Ethereum in US dollars, a leading cryptocurrency.

**1. Performance & Comparative Analysis**

*   **Cumulative Return (ETH-USD):** 579.18%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 85.56%
*   **Absolute Spread:** 504.6

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|------|--------|

| 2019-2021  | 1244.0%| 59.6% | 1195.0%| 0.0  | 418.3  |
| 2020-2022  | 319.0% | 71.3% | 317.0% | 0.0  | 135.9  |

| 2023-2025  | 134.0% | 75.2% | 76.0%  | 0.3  | 507.8  |

**Analysis of Table:**

*   **CAGR:**  Highly volatile, ranging from negative to extremely positive.  Recent periods (2021-2025) show significant volatility.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating substantial risk.  Values above 70% are very high.
*   **Alpha:** Generally positive during bull markets and strongly negative during bear markets, indicating Ethereum's performance is significantly influenced by broader market trends.
*   **Beta:** Very low to zero Beta suggests a low correlation with the S&P 500 over the periods analyzed. This is unexpected as Beta should reflect market volatility.
*   **Cap(B):** Increasing Cap(B) values suggest increased market capitalization and influence.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 4470.92
*   **Last Market Close:** Price: 4207.86, Previous Close: 4203.03, Change: 0.11%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 4524.51
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 4437.35
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 4204.81

**Interpretation:**

*   The current price is below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests potential short-term downward pressure but overall positive momentum in the medium term.
*   The slight positive change in the last market close (0.11%) is minimal and not a significant driver of the analysis.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3367 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 57.30 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.1564 (Slightly Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  "cash_1%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33)" - Suggests a cautious buying approach, allocating a small portion of available cash due to the low-risk MRI.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** -1.4 (Negative) - Indicates short-term underperformance compared to VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** 929.7% -  A very high expected return over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, suggesting potential for significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500.

**Interpretation:**

*   The MRI suggests low market risk.
*   The RSI is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   The PPO is slightly negative, hinting at minor bearish momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a cautious approach despite the low MRI, possibly due to other factors like volatility.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Microvast at BICES 2025:**  (Indirectly relevant - broader economic outlook)
*   **Women's Health Investment:** (Indirectly relevant - social and investment trends)
*   **Trump/Democrat Meeting on Shutdown:** (Macroeconomic risk - government instability)
*   **KOCCA at Tokyo Game Show:** (Indirectly relevant - Tech sector)
*   **Bill Gates on Children's Lives:** (Indirectly relevant - Global Health)
*   **SK keyfoundry Launches IMD Process:** (Indirectly relevant - Tech sector)

**Interpretation:**

The news headlines are largely macroeconomic and sectoral. The most directly relevant is the potential government shutdown, which could introduce volatility into the market.  The other news items contribute to a broader understanding of the economic and technological landscape.

**5. Overall Analysis & Summary**

ETH-USD has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but with extremely high volatility and risk as reflected in the CAGR and MDD values. While recent price action suggests some short-term downward pressure, the medium-term trend remains positive.

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. The low MRI suggests low market risk, but the PPO indicates some bearish momentum. The Hybrid Signal advocates for a cautious buying approach. The high expected return is attractive but should be viewed in light of the asset's historical volatility.

The news headlines introduce some macroeconomic uncertainty (potential government shutdown) but are generally not directly impacting ETH-USD.

**Recommendation:**

A cautious approach is warranted. While the long-term expected return is very high, the volatility and risk associated with ETH-USD are also significant. Consider the Hybrid signal of taking a small portion of available cash due to the low-risk MRI.
