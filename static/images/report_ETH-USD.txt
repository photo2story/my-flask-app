## ETH-USD Report

**0) Summary Statistics:**

ETH-USD, representing Ethereum, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.  The provided data shows significant outperformance against the S&P 500 (VOO), though with high volatility.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (ETH-USD):** 232.25%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 42.21%
* **Return Difference:** 190.04% (This represents the difference in cumulative returns between ETH-USD and VOO as of the last date in the dataset.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 13.8% (This indicates ETH-USD's performance relative to its historical range of divergence from VOO.  It's in the upper quartile of historical divergence, but doesn't necessarily predict future performance.)

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and significant swings in performance depending on the period considered.  High Beta values (especially in 2019-2021) indicate high sensitivity to market movements. The relatively low alpha values suggest that while ETH-USD significantly outperformed the market during some periods, a substantial part of this performance may be explained by market-wide trends.  Recent negative CAGR is notable.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -48.0%  | 70.3%  | -68.0% | 0.1    | 15.8   |
| 2018-2020  | 217.0%  | 70.3%  | 187.0% | 0.1    | 89.8   |
| 2019-2021  | 1244.0% | 57.7%  | 1196.0%| 0.1    | 448.2  |
| 2020-2022  | 320.0%  | 70.4%  | 315.0% | 0.1    | 146.0  |
| 2021-2023  | -226.0% | 70.4%  | -241.0%| 0.4    | 280.0  |
| 2022-2024  | -261.0% | 74.4%  | -278.0%| 0.4    | 405.6  |
| 2023-2025  | -213.0% | 74.4%  | -224.0%| 0.3    | 192.6  |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 1582.55
* **Last Market Price:** 1595.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 1593.75
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 1678.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 2026.78

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent slight increase (0.45%) from the previous close might indicate a minor bounce, but further observation is needed to confirm this.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.43 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions, but RSI should be interpreted with caution in highly volatile assets.)
* **PPO:** 0.36 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but the magnitude is relatively small)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 2831.9% (This is a very high figure.  The reliability of this projection needs to be carefully considered given the high volatility and inherent risk in cryptocurrencies.  It likely reflects past extreme performance, and is unlikely to be achieved consistently.)

The recent price increase of 0.45% is relatively minor and doesn't constitute a significant "sharp rebound" or "sharp decline."

**Conclusion:**

ETH-USD has historically shown substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, however, this has been accompanied by extreme volatility. Recent performance has been negative. While some indicators suggest potential short-term upward pressure, the overall picture is one of high risk.  The projected long-term return is exceptionally high and should be treated with significant skepticism.  Thorough due diligence and a high risk tolerance are essential before investing in ETH-USD.
