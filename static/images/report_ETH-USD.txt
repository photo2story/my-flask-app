## ETH-USD Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

ETH-USD, or Ether, is a cryptocurrency and the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).

The cumulative return for ETH-USD is 648.19%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 102.57%. The difference is 545.62%, placing it at the 41.43rd percentile of historical relative divergence (max: 1420.79%, min: -73.42%).  This indicates strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but past performance is not indicative of future results.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 3331.6 (Last Market: 3428.2)  A recent drop from the last market price is observed.
* **5-day Moving Average:** 3216.82
* **20-day Moving Average:** 3022.47
* **60-day Moving Average:** 2699.95

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the recent drop from the last market price signals caution.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 62.77 (Neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral momentum.)
* **PPO:** 0.19 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but relatively weak.)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +12.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 58.4%  This represents an expected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, assuming continued favorable market conditions for cryptocurrencies.  This is a significant figure and requires careful consideration of the inherent volatility of crypto assets. The 3428.2 last market price suggests a recent, potentially temporary, price drop. This requires further investigation of market news and events.

**7. Summary:**

ETH-USD has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, showing substantial growth. However, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile.  The current price is above its moving averages, but a recent price drop warrants attention. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish momentum, while the projected long-term return is high but carries substantial risk. The lack of traditional financial data limits the scope of a complete fundamental analysis.  Crucially, any investment decision must consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments, including regulatory uncertainty and market volatility.  Thorough due diligence, including review of current market news and expert opinions, is essential before making any investment in ETH-USD.
