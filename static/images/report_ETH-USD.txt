## ETH-USD Investment Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

ETH-USD, representing Ethereum, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.  The data shows a significantly higher cumulative return compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), although recent performance has been volatile.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (ETH-USD):** 472.25%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 98.02%
* **Return Difference:** 374.2%  (This represents a substantial outperformance of ETH-USD relative to the S&P 500.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 28.9% (This indicates that the current outperformance is in the upper quartile of historical relative performance, but doesn't predict future performance.)


The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and varying performance across different time periods.  The high alpha values in several periods suggest outperformance relative to the market (if we assume Beta is a representation of market risk),  while the negative alpha in 2022-2024 suggests significant underperformance.  The beta values fluctuate, indicating a shifting correlation with the overall market.  High CAGR values counterbalance with equally high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values indicating strong growth potential but also significant risk.  Note that the market cap (Cap(B)) changes across time.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2017-2019  | -83.0%   | 50.4% | -99.0% | 0.0   | 15.7   |
| 2018-2020  | 52.0%    | 50.4% | 25.0%  | 0.1   | 89.1   |
| 2019-2021  | 1201.0%  | 38.8% | 1130.0%| 0.1   | 444.9  |
| 2020-2022  | 259.0%   | 44.7% | 250.0% | 0.1   | 144.9  |
| 2021-2023  | -11.0%   | 44.7% | -34.0% | 0.5   | 277.9  |
| 2022-2024  | -164.0%  | 44.7% | -196.0%| 0.5   | 402.6  |
| 2023-2025  | 129.0%   | 21.8% | 68.0%  | 0.4   | 324.8  |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 2688.40
* **Last Market Price:** 2694.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 2792.90
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 3127.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 3376.26

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 23.97 (Suggests the asset is in oversold territory.)
* **PPO:** -1.65 (Indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -8.1% (Indicates a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the S&P 500)
* **Expected Return:** 1002.7% (This extremely high figure suggests a very optimistic long-term outlook relative to the S&P 500.  However, the reliability of this prediction is questionable given the high volatility and risk shown in previous data)

The small positive change in the last market price (0.24%) is not significant enough to classify as a sudden surge or drop.  The extremely high expected return requires further scrutiny and should not be taken as definitive prediction without further analysis.



**Conclusion:**

ETH-USD has historically shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but it also exhibits substantial volatility.  Current technical indicators suggest an oversold market and bearish momentum. The high projected return over the long term should be approached with caution due to the inherent risk associated with cryptocurrency investments.  Thorough due diligence and risk assessment are crucial before making any investment decisions.
