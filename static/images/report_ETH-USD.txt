## ETH-USD Report

**Executive Summary:** ETH-USD, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, shows significant performance divergence compared to the S&P 500 (VOO). While exhibiting high volatility and substantial periods of both outperformance and underperformance, its long-term expected return significantly surpasses that of the S&P 500.  Current technical indicators suggest a potentially overbought market condition.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ETH-USD's cumulative return (270.78%) drastically outperforms the S&P 500's (47.37%) return.  The current absolute divergence is 223.4, placing it at the 15.5th percentile of historical divergence (relative to the minimum and maximum historical divergences).


The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals highly volatile performance, with substantial year-over-year swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  The Alpha values suggest periods of outperformance relative to the market benchmark, however the Beta values indicate high volatility and correlation to market movements (especially from 2019-2021).  Capitalization also fluctuates widely reflecting the cryptocurrency market's dynamics.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -48.0%   | 70.3%  | -68.0% | 0.1   |        |
| 2018-2020  | 217.0%   | 70.3%  | 187.0% | 0.1   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 1244.0%  | 57.7%  | 1196.0%| 0.1   |        |
| 2020-2022  | 320.0%   | 70.4%  | 315.0% | 0.1   |        |
| 2021-2023  | -226.0%  | 70.4%  | -241.0%| 0.4   |        |
| 2022-2024  | -261.0%  | 74.4%  | -278.0%| 0.4   |        |

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** 1769.83
* **Last Market Price:** 1794.94 (0.49% increase from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 1698.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 1623.64
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 1903.09

The current price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.  However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term overbought condition.  The recent price increase of 0.49% reflects minor upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 72.51 (Approaching overbought territory; values above 70 generally suggest overbought conditions)
* **PPO:** 2.27 (Positive value indicates upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.8 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 2445.5%  (This represents a significant potential long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a period of 2 years or more.  However, this is a projected figure and highly uncertain given the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.)


**Conclusion:**

ETH-USD demonstrates substantial potential for long-term growth, but also carries significant risk due to its volatility.  The current technical indicators suggest a possible short-term overbought situation, but the long-term outlook, based on historical performance and the expected return, remains positive relative to the S&P 500.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing.  Further analysis incorporating additional factors (e.g., regulatory changes, technological developments) is recommended for a comprehensive assessment.
