2025-12-17 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Ethereum (ETH-USD) based on the provided data:

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** ETH-USD (Ethereum)
*   **Overview:** Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, ETH, and supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).
*   **ETH Cumulative Return:** 149.61%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 78.79%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 99.2
    *   Relative Divergence: 20.6
*   **Analysis:** Ethereum significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. The divergence of 99.2 indicates substantial outperformance. However, the relative divergence of 20.6 suggests that while the current difference is positive, it's relatively closer to the lower end of its historical divergence range compared to its maximum and minimum divergence values. The historical data also show periods of significant underperformance.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -56.0%  | 78.3% | -64.0%  | 0.0  | 15.6   |
| 2018-2020  | 24.0%   | 78.3% | 1.0%    | 0.0  | 89.0   |
| 2019-2021  | 505.0%  | 76.1% | 458.0%  | 0.0  | 444.4  |
| 2020-2022  | 118.0%  | 76.1% | 119.0%  | 0.0  | 144.4  |
| 2021-2023  | -92.0%  | 73.1% | -94.0%  | 0.1  | 275.4  |
| 2022-2024  | -72.0%  | 73.1% | -92.0%  | 0.1  | 402.2  |
| 2023-2025  | -14.0%  | 70.0% | -79.0%  | 0.3  | 353.4  |

*   **CAGR:** Volatile, ranging from -92% to +505%, reflecting the inherent risk and reward in crypto.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown figures (70-78.3%) indicate significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Strong positive Alpha during periods of high growth (e.g., 2019-2021, 2020-2022), but significantly negative Alpha during downturns, indicating poor risk-adjusted performance during those periods.
*   **Beta:** Extremely low Beta values over the period (0.0 to 0.3) suggest ETH has historically had very low correlation to the S&P 500. However, a higher beta in recent years (2023-2025) indicates that it is slowly becoming more correlated to the S&P500.
*   **Cap(B):** Shows significant volatility over the period.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 2928.57
*   **Last-Market Data:**
    *   Price: 2928.40
    *   Previous Close: 2962.63
    *   Change: -1.16%
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 3006.85
    *   20-day SMA: 3063.47
    *   60-day SMA: 3357.16

*   **Analysis:** The price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a short-term downtrend. The negative change in the last market session reinforces this bearish sentiment.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 43.99 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.12 (Slightly bearish signal, indicating short-term weakness relative to the long-term trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 3.0 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 644.0% (High expected return compared to S&P 500 over 2 years)

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is neutral. The PPO indicates potential weakness. The hybrid signal suggests that all cash should be put into the market. The short-term increase in relative divergence is a bullish sign, but should be considered in the context of the larger downward trend. The high expected return suggests that the model predicts strong growth over the long term.

*   No analyst consensus or targets provided.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Ethereum presents a mixed picture. It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, but with substantial volatility and drawdowns. Recent price action shows a short-term downtrend, with the price below key moving averages. The MRI indicates a medium investment risk, while the RSI is neutral, and the PPO suggests some weakness.

News articles reveal a market with both excitement and caution. Institutional interest, as evidenced by companies increasing their ETH holdings, is a positive sign. However, the debate about Ethereum's long-term viability remains, and the "Time For Panic Or Opportunity?" headline reflects current market uncertainty.

**Overall:**

*   **Short-Term:** Bearish, based on price action and moving averages.
*   **Long-Term:** Potentially bullish, based on the high expected return and potential for institutional adoption, but carries significant risk.

**Recommendation:**

Due to the recent negative movement, high volatility, and lack of clear analyst consensus, a **cautious approach** is recommended. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further research before investing in Ethereum. While the long-term potential is high, the short-term outlook is uncertain.
