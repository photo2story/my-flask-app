2025-12-06 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Ethereum (ETH-USD) based on the provided data, broken down into sections.

**1. Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, ETH, and supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).
*   **ETH-USD Cumulative Return:** 159.96%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 79.56%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current:** 76.8
    *   **Range:** Min: -67.5, Max: 740.2
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 17.9

**Analysis:**

*   Ethereum has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative return.
*   The current divergence is positive, indicating that Ethereum is performing better than the S&P 500.
*   However, the relative divergence of 17.9 suggests that the current divergence is relatively low compared to its historical range. This implies there is significant room for the divergence to grow if past patterns repeat.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -56.0% | 78.3%  | -64.0%  | 0.0   | 15.4   |
| 2018-2020  | 24.0%  | 78.3%  | 1.0%    | 0.0   | 87.5   |
| 2019-2021  | 505.0% | 76.1%  | 458.0%  | 0.0   | 436.8  |
| 2020-2022  | 118.0% | 76.1%  | 119.0%  | 0.0   | 141.9  |
| 2021-2023  | -92.0% | 73.1%  | -94.0%  | 0.1   | 270.6  |
| 2022-2024  | -72.0% | 73.1%  | -92.0%  | 0.1   | 395.2  |
| 2023-2025  | -4.0%  | 70.0%  | -69.0%  | 0.3   | 361.8  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) varies widely, reflecting Ethereum's volatile nature. The period 2019-2021 shows exceptional growth, while other periods show negative growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is the excess return compared to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500). The large positive alpha in 2019-2021 showcases Ethereum's potential for outperformance. The negative alpha in other periods indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta is consistently low, suggesting that Ethereum has a relatively weak correlation with the broader market (S&P 500). *A beta near zero indicates almost no correlation.*
*   **Cap(B):** This appears to be market capitalization in billions. This shows the growth and, in some periods, contraction of Ethereum's market cap.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 3050.53
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 2997.62, Previous Close: 3134.18, Change: -4.36
*   **5-day SMA:** 2973.67
*   **20-day SMA:** 3016.13
*   **60-day SMA:** 3619.32

**Analysis:**

*   The recent price is below both the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, reinforcing the short-term bearish sentiment.
*   The negative change from the previous close confirms recent price weakness.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 46.89
*   **PPO:** 1.04
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.2 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Fluctuation Issue:** The recent price drop (change: -4.36) indicates potential volatility.
*   **Expected Return:** 777.4%, Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, indicating a moderate level of risk.
*   The RSI of 46.89 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   A positive PPO suggests a recent uptrend.
*   The Hybrid signal is recommending to buy, indicating the potential for a price increase in the future.
*   The positive change in relative divergence over the past 20 days further supports the short-term uptrend.
*   The high "Expected Return" suggests that, despite short-term risks, long-term investment in Ethereum could be highly profitable.

Ethereum presents a complex investment picture:

*   **High Growth Potential:** Demonstrated by its historical outperformance against the S&P 500 and the very high "Expected Return" figure.
*   **High Volatility and Risk:** Evidenced by the high MDD, price fluctuations, and periods of negative CAGR and alpha.  The "crash" news also underscores this.
*   **Mixed Technical Signals:** The short-term SMAs indicate a possible downtrend. The RSI is neutral, and the PPO is positive. The MRI indicates medium risk.
*   **Positive Long-Term Catalysts:** Potential ETF, institutional adoption, and growing interest in the Ethereum ecosystem are positive long-term drivers. The hybrid signal indicating to buy is a good sign.

**Conclusion:**

Ethereum appears to be a high-risk, high-reward investment.  Recent news suggests a volatile market. The technical indicators provide mixed signals, with short-term weakness but long-term potential.
