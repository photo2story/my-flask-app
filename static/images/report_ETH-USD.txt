**1. Performance Analysis:**

ETH-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (represented by VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a cumulative return vastly exceeding that of VOO. The high relative divergence highlights this substantial outperformance. However, it is crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The provided CAGR figures show significant volatility and periods of both extreme gains and losses. The high betas, especially in earlier periods, point to significant sensitivity to market movements. While Alpha is generally positive, it also fluctuates, suggesting that outperformance isn't consistently present.  The substantial changes in market capitalization also indicate significant growth and periods of contraction.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -83.0%   | 50.4%   | -99.0% | 0.0   | 14.9   |
| 2018-2020  | 52.0%    | 50.4%   | 25.0% | 0.1   | 84.8   |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Price:** 3298.27
* **Last Market Price:** 3144.74 (a drop of -4.67 compared to the previous close of 3298.92). This represents a significant daily price decrease.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 3183.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 3266.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 3479.66

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The significant daily drop warrants further investigation into potential market-moving events.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 41.70  (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum.)
* **PPO:** 0.07 (Positive, but close to zero, indicating weak momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.0 (-) (Indicates a recent short-term downward trend)

The combination of a falling price, below-average moving averages, and a low RSI suggests a bearish short-term outlook.  The relatively low PPO value adds to the sense of limited upward momentum.  The negative divergence reinforces this, but its value of 0.0 indicates that changes in the relative divergence have been minimal recently.  The large negative change in the last market price (-4.67) highlights a substantial recent price drop, indicating a possible short-term correction or downturn.  Further investigation into the cause of this drop is advised.

**4. Expected Return:**

The expected return of 673.6% represents a potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500. This is a high-risk, high-reward projection and should be interpreted cautiously considering the historical volatility and the significant drop seen in the recent price.  This high projected return does not guarantee future results; it's a potential scenario based on past data.  Itâ€™s important to remember that investing in cryptocurrencies carries substantial risk.
