## ETH-USD Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

ETH-USD, or Ether, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests potential short-term volatility.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (ETH-USD):** 268.19%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 42.27%
* **Return Difference:** 225.92% (The ETH-USD significantly outperformed the S&P 500)
* **Relative Divergence:** 15.7% (This indicates ETH-USD's performance is in the higher range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.)

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high volatility and significant variation in performance across different periods.  While Alpha is generally positive, suggesting outperformance, the high Beta values (particularly in 2019-2021) indicate significant market sensitivity.  The highly fluctuating CAGR values underscore the risk associated with ETH-USD.  The large market capitalization fluctuations further emphasize the volatility and speculative nature of the investment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 1757.33
* **Last Market Price:** 1785.50
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 1625.29
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 1626.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 1936.75

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The recent price change of -0.59% indicates a minor price drop, but not a significant event.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 67.25 (Approaching overbought territory; suggesting potential price correction.)
* **PPO:** 1.50 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, though the RSI suggests a potential short-term slowdown)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 1.7 (+)  (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 2413.2% (This is a high expected return but crucial to note that this is highly speculative and predicated on historical performance that may not be representative of future returns.  The extremely high volatility of ETH-USD makes long-term predictions extremely unreliable.)

The combination of a moderately high RSI and a positive PPO suggests a potential near-term price correction despite the positive short-term divergence.  The high expected return, while tempting, must be viewed with extreme caution due to the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies.


**Overall:**

ETH-USD has demonstrated significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 in the past. However, it's crucial to acknowledge the extreme volatility and risk involved. The current price action, coupled with the RSI and MRI indicators, suggest caution in the short term. The high expected return over the long term needs to be critically evaluated considering the inherent uncertainties in the cryptocurrency market.  Investment decisions should account for the significant risk profile.
