## ETH-USD Investment Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

ETH-USD, representing Ethereum cryptocurrency, shows significantly higher cumulative returns (464.91%) than the S&P 500 (VOO, 73.72%) over an unspecified period. However, recent price action suggests a potential slowdown, with price below key moving averages.  While long-term potential remains high (1247.1% expected return vs. S&P 500),  volatility is a significant factor, indicated by high beta values and substantial maximum drawdowns (MDDs) in historical data.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Ethereum (ETH-USD) is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500, exhibiting a difference of 391.2% (relative divergence of 29.7% based on historical range).  However, this outperformance is not consistent, with periods of substantial negative returns (e.g., -61% CAGR in 2017-2019).

The alpha and beta values show high volatility and inconsistent outperformance against the market.  High beta values indicate significant price movements correlated with overall market trends.  The high MDDs highlight the substantial risk associated with ETH-USD investment.


| Year       | CAGR      | MDD  | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -61.0%    | 54.9% | -73.0% | 0.1   | 15.7   |
| 2018-2020  | 88.0%     | 54.9% | 54.0% | 0.1   | 89.1   |
| 2019-2021  | 1205.0%   | 41.1% | 1132.0%| 0.0   | 444.9  |
| 2020-2022  | 376.0%    | 56.9% | 365.0% | 0.1   | 144.9  |
| 2021-2023  | 174.0%    | 56.9% | 156.0% | 0.4   | 277.9  |
| 2022-2024  | -46.0%    | 67.5% | -69.0% | 0.4   | 402.6  |
| 2023-2025  | -30.0%    | 67.5% | -71.0% | 0.3   | 230.3  |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of ETH-USD is $1906.24.  The recent price increase (Last-market) shows a significant positive change of 4.73%, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, the price is below all three key moving averages, indicating potential bearish pressure:

* **Closing Price:** $1906.24
* **5-day MA:** $1851.75
* **20-day MA:** $1943.12
* **60-day MA:** $2318.77


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4444 (Low to Medium Risk).  This suggests a relatively manageable level of risk.
* **RSI:** 48.13 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold).
* **PPO:** 0.254 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum, though relatively weak).
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -3.2% (Short-term bearish trend).
* **Expected Return:** 1247.1% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500.  This exceptionally high figure needs to be viewed with caution given the inherent volatility.

The significant positive change in the last market data (4.73%) points to a recent price jump. However, given the other indicators (price below MAs, negative relative divergence) this jump may be temporary, and further analysis is required.


**Conclusion:**

ETH-USD presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.  While the historical data and projected long-term return are impressive, the significant volatility and inconsistent performance necessitate a careful risk assessment.  Investors should be prepared for potentially substantial drawdowns. The recent price jump requires further observation to confirm whether it represents a sustainable upward trend or a temporary surge.  A long-term investment strategy with a high risk tolerance is necessary.
