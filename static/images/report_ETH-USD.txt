## ETH-USD Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

ETH-USD, representing Ether cryptocurrency, showed significantly higher cumulative returns (365.56%) than the S&P 500 (VOO) at 48.68% over an unspecified period. However, recent price action indicates a downtrend, with the price below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages. Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) suggest the asset is in oversold territory, but a high market risk indicator warrants caution.  Long-term expected returns significantly exceed those of the S&P 500, but significant volatility is expected.


**1. Performance Analysis:**

ETH-USD, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.

The cumulative return of ETH-USD (365.56%) drastically outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) return of 48.68%. The difference is substantial (316.9 percentage points), placing its relative divergence within the top 19.2% of its historical range (based on a min/max range of -60.5% to 1902.0%).

Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and inconsistent performance year-over-year. While showing periods of extremely high positive alpha and significant outperformance (e.g., 2019-2021),  recent years (2021-2025) exhibit substantial negative returns, even outpacing the beta. This suggests sensitivity to overall market movements, but the influence of non-market factors is significant.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** 1815.3352
* **Last Market Price:** 1749.65 (a decrease of -3.13 from the previous close of 1806.0908).  This represents a relatively small daily change, however, it is important in the context of the downtrend discussed below.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 1831.0514
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 1928.9052
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 2261.3407

The current price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Returns:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.475 (High Risk)  This suggests elevated risk in the market.

* **RSI:** 37.82 (Oversold) - While below 50, indicating oversold conditions,  it is not extremely low, suggesting there may be further downside potential.

* **PPO:** 0.0485 (Slightly Positive) - A small positive value is less significant in the context of the broader downtrend.

* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (-): This short-term bearish indicator reinforces the price action analysis.

* **Expected Return:** 2436.3% (over the long term compared to S&P 500). This represents a significant potential for outperformance, especially given the large expected return figure. This should be viewed with caution due to the high volatility inherent in the asset and the market risk.

The substantial drop in price (-3.13) from the previous close is notable but doesn't trigger a "sudden drop" designation in isolation. Within the context of a longer downtrend, however, it reinforces the bearish outlook.

**Conclusion:**

While ETH-USD has historically shown massive returns exceeding the S&P 500, its recent price action and technical indicators paint a picture of short-term bearishness. The high market risk indicator adds to the cautionary signals.  The long-term expected returns are impressive, but investing requires careful consideration of the high volatility.  A diversified portfolio strategy with appropriate risk management is recommended.  Further analysis using longer-term data and broader market conditions is recommended before making any investment decisions.
