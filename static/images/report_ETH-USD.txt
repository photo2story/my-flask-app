## ETH-USD Investment Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

ETH-USD, representing Ethereum, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.  The provided data shows significant volatility and high potential returns but also substantial risk.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The cumulative return of ETH-USD is 231.4975%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a 0.0% cumulative return.  The relative divergence of 15.3% indicates that ETH-USD's performance is relatively higher compared to the historical range of its divergence from the S&P 500, but this is relative to its historical volatility, not an absolute measure of outperformance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals highly volatile returns:

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -48.0%   | 70.3%   | 1.0   | 1.0   | 16.1    |
| 2018-2020  | 217.0%  | 70.3%   | 1.0   | 1.0   | 91.5    |
| 2019-2021  | 1244.0% | 57.7%   | 1.0   | 1.0   | 456.9   |
| 2020-2022  | 320.0%  | 70.4%   | 1.0   | 1.0   | 148.8   |
| 2021-2023  | -226.0% | 70.4%   | 1.0   | 1.0   | 285.4   |
| 2022-2024  | -261.0% | 74.4%   | 1.0   | 1.0   | 413.4   |
| 2023-2025  | -213.0% | 74.4%   | 1.0   | 1.0   | 196.0   |

The consistent Beta of 1.0 suggests ETH-USD's price movements are highly correlated with the overall market,  while the highly variable CAGR highlights the extreme risk involved.  Alpha of 1.0 across all periods is likely a methodological limitation rather than reflecting consistent outperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 1579.73
* **Last Market Price:** 1623.73 (Increase of 2.8 from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 1590.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 1628.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 1951.79

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.  The recent increase of 2.8 indicates a small, positive upward shift.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk) –  Suggests a moderate level of risk.
* **RSI:** 51.68 –  Slightly above neutral (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.7852 – A positive value indicating bullish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** 0.3 (+) –  Short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 2691.0% –  This extremely high figure represents the potential long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500, but needs further clarification of its calculation methodology and inherent assumptions.  Such high potential returns are extremely speculative, and are coupled with potentially high risk of loss.  A more detailed explanation of the expected return calculation and underlying model is needed for proper assessment.


**Conclusion:**

ETH-USD demonstrates high potential for reward, but also carries substantial risk. Its performance is highly volatile and correlated with overall market trends. The provided expected return is very high and requires further validation.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in this asset. The short-term trend appears slightly bullish, but the longer-term outlook is uncertain and heavily dependent on broader market conditions and the future adoption of Ethereum.
