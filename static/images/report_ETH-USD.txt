**Conclusion:**

ETH-USD has shown substantial growth potential in the past, but also significant volatility and periods of substantial decline.  While the current RSI suggests oversold conditions and the long-term expected return is considerable, the recent sharp price drop and negative PPO indicate bearish momentum.  Investing in ETH-USD carries considerable risk and should be approached with caution.  A long-term perspective and a strong risk tolerance are necessary.  The high expected return is contingent upon a future upward trend, and past performance is not indicative of future results.
