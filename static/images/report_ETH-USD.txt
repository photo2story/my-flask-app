**Analysis of Alpha and Beta Table:**

*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values indicate ETH-USD's excess return compared to the S&P 500. Notably, the Alpha values are significantly positive in the 2018-2021 period but turn negative in more recent periods (2021-2025). This suggests that ETH-USD's performance has recently deteriorated relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are consistently low (around 0.1-0.3), indicating that ETH-USD is not highly correlated with the overall market.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD values are relatively high, ranging from 59.7% to 74.9%, which implies that ETH-USD experiences significant price drops.
*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR values vary significantly, reflecting the high volatility of ETH-USD. The most recent CAGR values (2021-2025) are negative, indicating poor recent performance.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 2641.37

    *   20-day MA: 2528.63
    *   60-day MA: 1989.97
*   **Analysis:** The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an uptrend. The 5-day MA is above the 20-day MA, which is also above the 60-day MA, confirming the short-term, medium-term, and long-term uptrend. The small negative price change compared to the previous close (-0.79%) indicates a slight pullback, but the overall trend remains positive.

**3. Technical Indicators and Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.366 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 47.04 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -1.014 (Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash 69% - Sell 69.7% of holdings (131 shares). This is a cautionary signal based on the technical analysis, suggesting a reduced position.
*   **20-day Relative Outperformance Change:** 0.0 (Short-term Decrease). This indicates the recent relative performance vs. the benchmark has deteriorated.
*   **Expected Return:** 1261.6%. This is a very high projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500. However, this projection should be viewed with extreme caution given the volatility and speculative nature of ETH-USD.

**4. Recent News & Events**

*   **Business Developments, Regulatory Changes, or Market Events:** Recent headlines regarding ETH-USD.
*   **Analyst Discussions:** Analysts discussing recent performance in the context of industry trends and global economic factors.
*   **Notable Volatility:** Stock has shown notable volatility, influenced by recent news, earnings reports, or executive actions.
*   **Risk and Opportunity:** Market experts highlight both risks and opportunities.

**5. Overall Assessment**

ETH-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically. However, its recent performance has been relatively weak, as indicated by negative CAGR values and deteriorating Alpha. The current uptrend based on moving averages is tempered by a cautionary Hybrid Signal and a negative PPO. The low Market Risk Indicator (MRI) indicates low risk, but the high volatility (as measured by high MDD) should be noted. Recent news indicates market attention and volatility.

**Investment Recommendation:** The Hybrid Signal suggests caution and a reduction in holdings. The high volatility and speculative nature of ETH-USD make it a high-risk, high-reward investment. While the long-term expected return is very high, the recent performance and cautionary signals suggest a need for careful monitoring and a potentially reduced allocation within a diversified portfolio. The "sell" advice should be carefully considered in light of the overall analysis.
