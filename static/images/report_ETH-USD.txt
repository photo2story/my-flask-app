## ETH-USD Performance Analysis

This report analyzes the performance of ETH-USD, the cryptocurrency Ether, compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  ETH-USD is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.


**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ETH-USD shows a significantly higher cumulative return (275.74%) than the S&P 500 (49.49%) over the analyzed period.  The difference, currently at 226.3, represents a considerable divergence.  The relative divergence of 15.7% indicates that ETH-USD's performance is positioned relatively high compared to its historical range of performance against the S&P 500. However, this relative measure does not imply consistent outperformance.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and inconsistent performance. While some periods show extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others exhibit substantial negative returns and high maximum drawdowns (MDD). The beta values fluctuate wildly, highlighting the high sensitivity of ETH-USD to market movements in certain periods.  This high beta reflects the inherent risk associated with cryptocurrencies.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 1793.775390625
* **Last Market Price:** 1839.8527 (a 2.55% increase from the previous close of 1794.0542) indicating a recent price jump. This suggests a potential short-term upward trend.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 1801.3098
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 1683.2484
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 1847.9947

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bullish trend, though longer-term trends may be less certain.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3721 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 76.73 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 1.73 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.3 (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return:** 2395.1% (This extraordinarily high figure needs further context and clarification.  Is this an annualized return?  What assumptions are built into this projection? Such a high number should be treated with significant skepticism.)

The recent price jump of 2.55% should be noted, although further analysis is needed to determine if this is sustainable.  The high RSI suggests overbought conditions, implying a potential short-term pullback is likely. The positive PPO reinforces the bullish momentum, but the negative relative divergence change signals short-term bearish pressure.

The projected expected return of 2395.1% over a long-term horizon (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is extremely high and warrants careful consideration.  This projection likely relies on specific assumptions about future ETH-USD price movements that should be explicitly stated and critically evaluated.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.  High potential returns are often associated with high risk.
