## ETH-USD Performance Analysis

**Ticker:** ETH-USD

### 1. Relative Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 38.05%

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows wide fluctuations, highlighting ETH-USD's volatile nature.  There are periods of substantial growth (e.g., 2019-2021) and significant declines (e.g., 2021-2023, 2022-2024).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant potential losses during downturns.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are mostly aligned with the CAGR, indicating that the majority of the return is attributable to ETH-USD's own performance rather than market-related factors.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to zero suggest ETH-USD's price movements are not strongly correlated with the S&P 500. In other words, ETH-USD's volatility is independent of broader market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap in Billions (USD) changes over time, reflecting growth and contraction.

The hybrid signal recommends a balanced approach, indicating cautious optimism. While the long-term expected return is extremely high, this must be balanced with the understanding that ETH-USD is a risky asset that can be impacted by various regulatory and market developments. Therefore, investors should conduct thorough due diligence and carefully consider their risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Monitoring news and announcements related to ETH-USD and the broader cryptocurrency market is critical.
