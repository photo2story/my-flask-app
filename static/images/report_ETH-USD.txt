## ETH-USD Performance Analysis (as of May 31, 2025)

**Ticker:** ETH-USD
**Company:** ETH-USD (Ethereum) - A decentralized, open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether.

### 1. Performance Overview

Here's a summary of ETH-USD's performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO):

*   **Cumulative Return (ETH-USD):** 426.08%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 50.97%
*   **Absolute Divergence:** 375.1
*   **Relative Divergence Percentile:** 23.9

**Analysis:**

*   ETH-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period.
*   However, the Relative Divergence Percentile of 23.9 suggests that, while positive, this outperformance is not as extreme compared to its historical range against the S&P 500. It implies that while ETH-USD is still doing better than VOO, its advantage is currently closer to the lower end of its historical outperformance spectrum.

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR Volatility:** ETH-USD shows very high volatility in its Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) across different periods, ranging from large gains (1229%) to significant losses (-255%).
*   **High Maximum Drawdown (MDD):**  MDD is consistently high, indicating substantial risk of loss during downturns.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is also volatile, correlating with the CAGR.  Positive alpha means outperformance relative to the benchmark, while negative alpha indicates underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are low (0.1-0.3), suggesting ETH-USD has a relatively low correlation with the overall market (S&P 500). This can be both a positive and a negative, meaning it may not fall as much in a market crash, but also may not rise as much in a bull market.  The Beta increasing from 0.1 to 0.3 in later years could suggest increasing correlation with the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):** Represents the market capitalization in Billions.

### 3. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 2639.40
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 2608.55, Previous Close: 2631.68, Change: -0.88%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 2620.12
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 2568.20
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 2018.47

**Analysis:**

*   The price decreased slightly by -0.88%.
*   The current price is above the 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, which is generally considered a bullish signal in the short to medium term. However, the shorter-term moving averages (5-day and 20-day) are closer to the current price than the 60-day, which suggests that the recent upward trend might be losing some momentum.

### 4. Technical Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.366 (Low Risk)
*   **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 57.64
*   **PPO:** -0.86
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_69%_Sell 69.7% of holdings (131 shares - Caution - MRI:0.37)
*   **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.2 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 1277.1% (Long-term, over 2 years, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A low-risk indication is generally positive.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 57.64 indicates a neutral condition.  It is neither overbought (above 70) nor oversold (below 30).
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, which can be a bearish signal. However, the value is relatively small (-0.86), suggesting that the bearish momentum is not very strong.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The hybrid signal is strongly recommending a significant reduction in holdings (selling 69.7% and holding 69% cash). The caution flag and the MRI value accompanying the signal indicate that the recommendation is driven by a risk assessment.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:**  The short-term increase in relative divergence is a positive sign, indicating that ETH-USD is outperforming the S&P 500 in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (1277.1%) suggests significant potential upside over the long term, assuming continued adoption and growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. This must be taken with caution, as such high returns are rarely guaranteed and come with substantial risk.

### 5. Recent News & Events

*   **May 31, 2025:** Analysts are discussing ETH-USD's performance in the context of industry trends and global economic factors.

**Analysis:**

The news snippets indicate that ETH-USD is currently subject to significant market attention and volatility. The focus on business developments, regulatory changes, and broader economic factors suggests that these elements are likely driving recent price movements. The analyst's advice to monitor news and company announcements is particularly relevant in this context.

### 6. Overall Conclusion

ETH-USD has shown substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but with very high volatility and risk. While the low MRI suggests a general low-risk environment, the Hybrid Signal's recommendation to reduce holdings highlights potential short-term concerns. The recent price action is bullish, but the relatively small change and neutral RSI, coupled with a negative PPO, suggest a possible slowdown in the upward trend.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Caution is advised.**  The high volatility and the Hybrid Signal's recommendation to sell indicate that a conservative approach is warranted.
*   **Monitor the news:** Pay close attention to the regulatory changes and business developments mentioned in the recent news. These events could significantly impact ETH-USD's price.
*   **Manage risk:** Given the high MDD and past volatility, carefully manage your position size and consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses.
*   **Long-term perspective:** While the expected return is high, remember that this is a long-term projection and is not guaranteed. The cryptocurrency market is highly speculative, and investment decisions should be based on a thorough understanding of the risks involved.
