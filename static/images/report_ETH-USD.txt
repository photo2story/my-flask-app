## ETH-USD Investment Report

**1. Performance Overview and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO)**

ETH-USD, representing Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.

The cumulative return of ETH-USD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 649.8%, indicating ETH-USD's substantial outperformance.  While the relative divergence indicator (46.7%) suggests ETH-USD is currently in the upper half of its historical range relative to VOO, the sheer magnitude of the difference highlights the significant risk and reward profile associated with ETH-USD.  Note that high relative divergence does not guarantee future outperformance.

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD (%) | Alpha | Beta | Cap (B) |
|------------|-----------|---------|-------|------|---------|
| 2017-2019  | -83.0%     | 50.4    | -99.0% | 0.1  | 16.0    |
| 2018-2020  | 52.0%      | 50.4    | 25.0%  | 0.1  | 90.0    |
| 2019-2021  | 1201.0%   | 38.8    | 1130.0%| 0.1  | 448.0   |
| 2020-2022  | 259.0%    | 44.7    | 250.0% | 0.1  | 146.0   |
| 2021-2023  | -11.0%     | 44.7    | -34.0% | 0.1  | 280.0   |

**2. Recent Price Movement**

* **Last Price:** 3911.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 3795.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 3713.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 3118.24

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the last market price (3951.62) being slightly higher than the reported closing price warrants attention. This difference, though relatively small, could indicate a recent price jump or correction.


**3. Technical Indicators**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 62.09 –  Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions; the market is relatively neutral.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.69 – Indicates a bearish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.2 – Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.


**4. Expected Return & Divergence**

The expected return of 906.6% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 represents a significantly higher potential return but should be interpreted cautiously due to the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency market.  The considerable historical volatility (reflected in MDD values) makes such predictions highly uncertain.

**5. News and Recent Issues (Missing Data)**

To provide a complete analysis, information on recent cryptocurrency market trends (within the last 2 days), regulatory updates, technological advancements, and market sentiment is crucial.  Please provide this data for a more comprehensive report.


**6. Overall Analysis**

ETH-USD has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, but this performance comes with heightened volatility. The current price is above its moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend, but indicators like the PPO and relative divergence suggest some caution.  The high expected return is enticing, but investors need to be aware of the substantial risk. The lack of recent news and market data prevents a more complete assessment of the current market conditions and their impact on ETH-USD's short-term and long-term outlook.  A thorough analysis requires data on recent news, regulatory developments, and market sentiment. The gap between the last market price and the reported closing price requires further investigation.  This discrepancy could signal a rapid price movement, potentially justifying a reevaluation of the current outlook.
