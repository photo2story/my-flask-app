**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided table shows highly volatile performance for ETH-USD, with significant swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD).  Noteworthy is the extremely high CAGR and Alpha in 2019-2021 and the subsequent sharp decline in 2022-2024.  Beta values are also highly variable, indicating significant sensitivity to market fluctuations, although less so in 2019-2021. The high beta values generally suggest strong correlation with market movements, though not consistently. The substantial fluctuations in Beta suggest changing market correlations over time. Capitalization (Cap) has seen substantial growth over time.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 2002.357421875
* **Last Market Price:** 1836.941 (a 1.67% increase from the previous close of 1806.7074).  This represents a relatively small price change.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 2032.4178
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 1975.5318
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 2429.7135

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend, although the recent small price increase may indicate some short-term buying pressure.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 62.11 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.58 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1128.3% (This is a very high projected return, and it is crucial to understand the assumptions and limitations underlying this projection.  High volatility and risk are inherent in this projection).

The relatively small price increase in the last market price (1.67%) does not indicate a significant uptrend or downtrend.  Given the overall information, the recent movements are relatively minor and don't signal any dramatic shift in price. The high expected return should be interpreted cautiously, recognizing the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies and the significant risk associated with such a high projected return.  Long-term investment requires careful consideration of risk tolerance.
