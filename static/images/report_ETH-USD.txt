## ETH-USD Performance Analysis

This report analyzes the performance of ETH-USD, Ethereum, a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ETH-USD shows a significantly higher cumulative return (282.85%) compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 52.13%.  The difference in cumulative return is 230.7%, placing it at the 15.9th percentile of its historical range of performance differences relative to the S&P 500 (ranging from a minimum of -67.9% to a maximum of 1805.7%). This highlights ETH-USD's substantial outperformance, though it's important to note that this is a point-in-time observation and past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals high volatility and inconsistent performance over different periods.  While some periods show extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and significant alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others exhibit substantial negative returns and large maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The Beta values fluctuate dramatically, reflecting varying levels of market sensitivity.  This suggests ETH-USD is a high-risk, high-reward asset with a significantly different risk profile than the S&P 500. The high beta values indicate that the price of ETH-USD is highly sensitive to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

ETH-USD's closing price is 1842.71.  The last market price shows a slight decrease of -0.39% from the previous close (1826.63 vs 1833.83).  The moving averages suggest a relatively flat to slightly bearish short-term trend:

* **5-day MA:** 1814.75
* **20-day MA:** 1706.81
* **60-day MA:** 1831.61


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 indicates a medium risk level.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 78.74 is significantly above the overbought threshold (typically 70), suggesting the asset may be overbought.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.56 is positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent increase of 0.2 in the 20-day relative divergence signals a short-term upward trend.
* **Price Change:** The small negative change (-0.39%) from the previous close does not indicate a significant event such as a sudden surge or crash.
* **Expected Return:** A projected 2352% return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 highlights the potential for significant outperformance but also the substantial risk involved.  This high expected return should be interpreted cautiously, given the inherent volatility of ETH-USD.


**Conclusion:**

ETH-USD exhibits substantial potential for high returns but also carries a considerable risk. The high volatility and inconsistent performance history underscore the need for a well-defined risk management strategy.  Investors should thoroughly assess their risk tolerance before investing in ETH-USD, considering its high beta and historical drawdowns.  The high expected return should be viewed with a critical eye, acknowledging the uncertainties inherent in long-term cryptocurrency projections.  The current overbought RSI and the past volatility pattern suggest that careful risk management is crucial.
