*   **Long-Term Investors:** Given the high expected return and the hybrid signal, Ethereum could be a worthwhile addition to a diversified portfolio for long-term investors who are comfortable with high volatility.
*   **Short-Term Traders:** Monitor the price action closely for confirmation of a reversal before entering a long position. The oversold RSI suggests a possible buying opportunity.
