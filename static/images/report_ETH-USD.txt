2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the Ethereum (ETH-USD) data provided, compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).

## 1) Return Rate Comparison

*   **Company Overview:** Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain system featuring its own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH).
*   **Ethereum (ETH-USD) Cumulative Return:** 143.75%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 73.30%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current Divergence (ETH-USD - VOO):** 60.30
    *   **Divergence Range:** -67.5 to 740.2
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 15.8 (This means the current divergence is in the bottom 15.8% of the historical range of divergence between ETH-USD and VOO.)

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Table:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| 2018-2020  | 24.0%   | 99.8%  | 4.0%    | 1.0  | 89.1   |
| 2019-2021  | 505.0%  | 99.6%  | 462.0%  | 1.1  | 444.8  |
| 2020-2022  | 118.0%  | 95.7%  | 120.0%  | 1.4  | 144.5  |
| 2021-2023  | -92.0%  | 91.0%  | -93.0%  | 1.7  | 275.6  |
| 2022-2024  | -72.0%  | 81.4%  | -91.0%  | 1.6  | 402.5  |
| 2023-2025  | -23.0%  | 83.9%  | -85.0%  | 1.4  | 358.4  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR shows the average annual growth rate over the specified periods.  Notice the significant volatility. High CAGR in 2019-2021 highlights the bull market period for Ethereum. More recent periods (2021-2025) show negative CAGR.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  High MDDs across all periods reflect the significant price volatility inherent in Ethereum. MDD is consistently high across the periods, reflecting Ethereum's volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the investment's performance relative to the benchmark (presumably the S&P 500 or a similar market index) on a risk-adjusted basis.  Large positive alpha in some periods suggests outperformance. Large negative alpha in recent periods suggests underperformance compared to the benchmark, considering the risk taken.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the investment's volatility relative to the market. A beta above 1 indicates higher volatility than the market.  Ethereum consistently shows a beta above 1, indicating it is more volatile than the market (presumably the S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** This is unclear what it means without further context, but judging by its units (B), it seems to be the market capitalization in billions.

## 2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations

*   **Current Close:** 3015.83
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 3017.91
    *   Previous Close: 3000.24
    *   Change: 0.59%
*   **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**
    *   5-day SMA: 2973.08
    *   20-day SMA: 2955.55
    *   60-day SMA: 3071.97

**Analysis:**

*   The price closed slightly above its previous close, indicating a marginal positive change in the last market session.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which can be seen as a short-term bullish signal.
*   The current price is below the 60-day SMA, which could be interpreted as a sign of potential resistance at that level.

## 3) Indicator Analysis

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 56.75 (Neutral - Neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.43 (Slightly Bullish - Above 0 suggests upward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 829.39% (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term).

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" level, indicating a moderate level of risk.
*   The RSI is in a neutral zone, not providing a strong buy or sell signal.
*   The PPO is slightly positive, suggesting some upward momentum, but not overwhelmingly strong.
*   The hybrid signal recommends buying with 100% of available cash.
*   The short-term divergence change indicates recent positive momentum relative to VOO.
*   The extremely high expected return should be viewed with significant skepticism. Such high projections are often unrealistic and based on optimistic assumptions.

## 4) Recent News & Significant Events

*   **[2026-01-01] Symmetrical Triangle Breakout Imminent:** This suggests potential for a significant price move in either direction.
*   **[2025-08-14] Ethereum surges to near record as investors bet on 'biggest macro trade' of the next decade:** This article highlights positive sentiment and potential for long-term growth.
*   **[2025-11-13] Ethereum: Time For Panic Or Opportunity? (Technical Analysis):** This suggests market uncertainty and a need for careful analysis.
*   **[2025-08-10] Ether Prices Top $4,300:** This indicates a period of high prices and potential adoption by companies.

*   **[2025-12-04] ETHA ETF: Ethereum's Stablecoin Story Is Improving:** This suggests positive developments in the stablecoin ecosystem related to Ethereum.

**Analysis:**

The news headlines present a mixed picture. There's positive sentiment around long-term potential and institutional adoption, but also volatility, uncertainty, and the potential for both upside and downside movements.

## 5) Comprehensive Analysis

Ethereum (ETH-USD) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically. The cumulative return is much higher, however, it comes with significantly higher risk and volatility as shown by the high MDD and Beta values. The relative divergence suggests that the current difference in performance is currently in the lower range of its historical values.

Recent price action shows a marginal positive trend, with short-term moving averages indicating potential further gains. However, the price remains below the 60-day SMA, suggesting potential resistance. The technical indicators are mostly neutral to slightly bullish.

The news highlights a mix of positive long-term potential and short-term uncertainty. The "symmetrical triangle breakout" news suggests that a significant price movement is likely in the near future, but the direction is uncertain.

**Overall:**

Ethereum presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The potential for significant gains is apparent, but so is the risk of substantial losses, as shown by its MDD and Beta values. The recent positive news and the slightly bullish technical indicators are encouraging, but investors should be prepared for potential volatility and be mindful of risk management, especially because the 829.39% Expected Return should be considered as extremely unlikely to happen.
