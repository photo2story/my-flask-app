*   **CAGR Volatility:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) varies dramatically, showing periods of extremely high growth (e.g., 1244% in 2019-2021) and significant declines (e.g., -261% in 2022-2024). This highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of ETH-USD.
*   **High MDD:** Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, ranging from ~58% to 74%, indicating substantial potential for loss during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally positive during high-growth periods, demonstrating outperformance relative to the market. Conversely, negative alpha values during down years suggest underperformance compared to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low (between 0.1 and 0.4), implying that ETH-USD's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap:** Cap(B) refers to Market Cap in Billion Dollar, and as you can see in the table, it shows how ETH-USD has grown or shrunken over the years.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 2345.51
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 2469.26, Previous Close: 2496.08, Change: -1.07% (Slight decrease)
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day MA: 1999.68
    *   20-day MA: 1830.32
    *   60-day MA: 1811.76
*   **Analysis:** The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. The 5-day MA being significantly higher than the 20-day and 60-day MAs indicates strong recent momentum. The slight price decrease in the last market data does not override the overall signal of upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3676 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 89.24 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 2.87 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
*   **20-day Relative Spread Change:** 5.6 (Positive - short term upward movement)
*   **Expected Return:** 1589.2% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests relatively low market risk.
*   **RSI:** The high RSI value signals that ETH-USD is currently overbought, which might indicate a potential pullback or consolidation in the near term.
*   **PPO:** The positive PPO value confirms the upward momentum.
*   **Relative Spread Change:** A positive change in relative spread indicates that ETH-USD has recently outperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return suggests significant potential for long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500, if one invests in ETH-USD in the long run. However, this should be viewed with caution given the historical volatility of ETH-USD.
*   **Last Market Data Consideration**: Last Market price drop is not significant in this case.

*   **[2025-05-11]:** Market experts highlight both risks and opportunities.

**Analysis:**  The news suggests that ETH-USD is subject to significant volatility and is being actively analyzed by market experts. Investors should closely monitor news and company announcements to stay informed about potential risks and opportunities.

**5. Overall Analysis**

ETH-USD has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over certain periods, but also exhibits periods of substantial underperformance and high volatility.  Recent price action suggests strong upward momentum, but the overbought RSI indicates potential for a near-term pullback. The news highlights the importance of monitoring market developments.

**Summary:**

*   **Positive:** High potential returns, recent upward price momentum, strong outperformance in certain periods, low market risk indicator.
*   **Negative:** High volatility, high maximum drawdown, overbought RSI, regulatory and market event risks.

**Recommendation:**

ETH-USD presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. While the technical indicators suggest short-term caution due to overbought conditions, the long-term expected return is very high. Investors should conduct thorough research, carefully consider their risk tolerance, and closely monitor market developments. A gradual investment approach (e.g., dollar-cost averaging) may be suitable to mitigate the risks associated with high volatility.
