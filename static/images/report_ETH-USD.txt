## Ethereum (ETH-USD) Analysis - November 22, 2025

**Ticker:** ETH-USD
**Company:** Ethereum (A decentralized, open-source blockchain system featuring its own cryptocurrency, Ether.)

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **Cumulative Return (ETH-USD):** 142.82%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 71.89%
*   **Absolute Divergence:** 93.2%
*   **Relative Divergence:** 19.9 (On a scale where the historical divergence range is 0-100, ETH-USD's outperformance is in the 19.9th percentile.)

**Analysis:** Ethereum has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return.  However, the "Relative Divergence" suggests that this level of outperformance, while positive, is not historically extreme.

Here's an analysis of the provided table:

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -56.0%  | 78.3% | -64.0%  | 0.0  | 15.3   |
| 2018-2020  | 24.0%   | 78.3% | 1.0%    | 0.0  | 86.9   |
| 2019-2021  | 505.0%  | 76.1% | 458.0%  | 0.0  | 433.9  |
| 2020-2022  | 118.0%  | 76.1% | 119.0%  | 0.1  | 141.0  |
| 2021-2023  | -92.0%  | 73.1% | -94.0%  | 0.1  | 268.8  |
| 2022-2024  | -72.0%  | 73.1% | -92.0%  | 0.1  | 392.7  |
| 2023-2025  | -21.0%  | 70.0% | -78.0%  | 0.3  | 333.7  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Highly volatile. Periods of massive growth (e.g., 2019-2021) are followed by significant declines (e.g., 2021-2023).  This indicates a high-risk, high-reward asset.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, ranging from 70% to 78.3%.  This reinforces the high volatility and potential for significant losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Significant alpha generation during growth periods, but also substantial negative alpha during downturns.  This means Ethereum's performance is largely independent of the market and driven by its own specific factors.
*   **Beta:**  Consistently low (close to 0.0-0.3). This suggests Ethereum has had a very weak correlation with the broader market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):**  Fluctuates significantly, reflecting the price volatility of Ethereum.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 2831.78
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 2768.07, Previous Close: 2830.57, Change: -2.21
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 3019.04
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 3378.76
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 3882.32

**Analysis:** Ethereum's price is currently below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day).  This suggests a short-term and potentially intermediate-term downward trend. The last market data indicates a recent negative change (-2.21), confirming the current downward pressure.

### 3. Technical Indicators & Outlook

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 28.72 (Oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.26
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_1%_Buy 100% of cash (64 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -4.5 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 681.0% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation.
*   The RSI indicates Ethereum is currently oversold, which *could* signal a potential for a price rebound.  However, oversold conditions can persist.
*   The negative PPO reinforces the downward momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal is recommending to buy, suggesting that the model sees value in Ethereum at these levels.
*   The negative change in relative divergence indicates a short-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   The extremely high expected return suggests a very optimistic long-term outlook, but this should be viewed with caution given Ethereum's historical volatility.
*   The negative change (-2.21) between previousClose and price is not big enough to reflect immediate issue.

### 4. Recent News & Events

*   **Sabio Earnings Announcement:**  Upcoming financial results from Sabio. (Potentially irrelevant unless Sabio has significant Ethereum-related activities)
*   **Capital Group Canada ETFs:** Cash distribution announcements. (Unlikely to have a direct impact on Ethereum)
*   **Walmart's E-commerce Growth:** Discussion of Walmart's e-commerce strategy. (Irrelevant)
*   **Hamilton ETFs Distributions:**  Cash distribution announcements. (Unlikely to have a direct impact on Ethereum)
*   **Streaming Platform Testing Crypto Tipping:** A popular streaming platform is testing Bitcoin, XAUT, and USDT tipping.  *This is positive news for the broader cryptocurrency space and could indirectly benefit Ethereum by increasing awareness and adoption of digital currencies.*

### 5. Conclusion

Ethereum's recent performance indicates a short-term downward trend, as evidenced by its price action below key moving averages, a negative PPO, and a negative change in relative divergence. While the RSI suggests it's oversold, and the MRI is at a Medium level, the long-term expected return remains extremely high, signaling potential for significant future growth. The news of a streaming platform testing crypto tipping is a positive sign for the broader cryptocurrency market. Overall, Ethereum remains a high-risk, high-reward asset, with a volatile track record.
