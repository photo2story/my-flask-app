**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **Cumulative Return (ETH-USD):** 480.26%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 99.23%
* **Return Difference:** 381.00% (This represents the difference in cumulative returns between ETH-USD and VOO as of the last data point).

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals significant volatility and varying performance against the market (likely due to the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies):

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD       | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -83.0%     | 50.4%     | -99.0% | 0.0   | 15.5    |
| 2018-2020  | 52.0%      | 50.4%     | 25.0% | 0.1   | 88.4    |
| 2019-2021  | 1201.0%    | 38.8%     | 1130.0%| 0.1   | 441.4   |
| 2020-2022  | 259.0%     | 44.7%     | 250.0% | 0.1   | 143.7   |
| 2021-2023  | -11.0%     | 44.7%     | -34.0% | 0.5   | 275.7   |
| 2022-2024  | -164.0%    | 44.7%     | -196.0%| 0.5   | 399.4   |
| 2023-2025  | 137.0%     | 21.8%     | 75.0%  | 0.4   | 326.7   |


Note that high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values are offset by equally significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  The beta fluctuates considerably, indicating a non-consistent correlation with the market. Alpha values are generally high, suggesting periods of significant outperformance relative to the market, but again, this is highly volatile.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 2726.09
* **Last Market Price:** 2710.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 2680.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 2876.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 3217.93

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price change (-0.57%) indicates a minor decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 25.40 (This suggests the asset is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity but also the risk of continued decline).
* **PPO:** -0.09 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum).
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.2 (Indicates a slight recent uptrend in relative performance against the benchmark).
* **Expected Return:** 977.2% (This represents a potentially high long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500, but this is a prediction and highly uncertain given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies and the significant historical swings in performance.)

**Conclusion:**

ETH-USD has historically shown periods of substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but with extreme volatility and significant drawdowns.  While the current RSI and price action might suggest a buying opportunity for some investors, the negative PPO and overall recent price trend paint a more bearish picture in the short term.  The high projected long-term expected return should be viewed with caution due to the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market.  Any investment decision should be based on a thorough risk assessment and a long-term investment horizon, while acknowledging the possibility of significant losses.
