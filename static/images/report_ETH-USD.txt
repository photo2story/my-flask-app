## ETH-USD Investment Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

ETH-USD, representing Ethereum, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.  The provided data shows significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), although recent performance has been negative.  Key indicators suggest the asset is currently oversold, presenting a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors, despite recent price declines.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ETH-USD's cumulative return (467.61%) vastly exceeds the S&P 500's (VOO) return (99.22%). The difference is substantial, with a current divergence of 368.4 (representing the 28.5th percentile of historical divergence between the two assets).  However, this is a snapshot in time and the historical volatility highlighted by the maximum and minimum divergence (1475.3 and -73.5 respectively) emphasizes the risk involved.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and varying degrees of correlation with the market (as reflected in the Beta).  While periods of significant outperformance exist (e.g., 2019-2021), periods of substantial underperformance are also evident (e.g., 2022-2024). The high Alpha values in some periods indicate periods of significant outperformance relative to the market.  The changing market capitalization (Cap(B)) suggests significant growth over time.  However, this high volatility and varying correlation with the market underscores the importance of a thorough risk assessment.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $2666.53
* **Last Market Price:** $2666.26 (a decrease of $71.53 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $2659.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $2905.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $3238.80

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend. The recent price drop (-2.61%) is substantial and contributes to the overall bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (25.22):**  Indicates the asset is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.46):** Suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.4, indicating a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (1017.8%):** This high expected return is over a longer-term timeframe (2+ years). It reflects the potential for significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 from this current oversold position, but it's crucial to remember that this is a projection and not a guarantee, especially considering the high historical volatility.

**Conclusion:**

ETH-USD presents a complex investment case. While its long-term performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500, it's characterized by high volatility.  The current oversold conditions (low RSI and recent price drop), coupled with a long-term positive expected return, suggest a potential buying opportunity for investors with a high risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon. However, careful consideration of the risks associated with this highly volatile asset is crucial before making any investment decision.  This analysis is based on limited data and should not be the sole basis for investment choices.  Consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
