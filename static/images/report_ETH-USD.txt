**Simple Analysis:**

*   The current divergence is 74.9, but with a relative divergence of 17.6, it suggests that current divergence is toward the lower end of its historical range.
*   The stock price is slightly above its previous close, indicating a marginal increase.
*   The 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) are close to the current price, while the 60-day SMA is higher, suggesting recent price consolidation after a potentially previous downward trend.
*   The high MRI suggests a favorable investment environment according to this indicator, and the RSI is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   The PPO is close to 0, suggesting a very small positive trend.
*   The expected return is extremely high.

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Analysis (vs. S&P 500)**

*   **Company Overview:** Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain system featuring smart contract functionality.

*   **Return Rate Analysis:** Ethereum's cumulative return (153.32%) far surpasses that of the S&P 500 (81.20%). This indicates significantly higher growth potential (and likely higher risk) compared to the broader market index. The divergence of 74.9 is significant, but the relatively low relative divergence (17.6) suggests this outperformance is currently at the low end of its historical range. This could mean it's a good entry point, or it could indicate a period of underperformance relative to its history is beginning.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    |            | Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
    |------------|------------|----------|----------|-------|------|--------|
    |            | 2024-2026  | 139.0%   | 78.3%    | 61.0% | 0.0  | 358.7  |

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 139.0% - This is an exceptionally high growth rate, indicating aggressive potential returns.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 78.3% - This is a very large drawdown, reflecting the high volatility and risk associated with Ethereum. Investors must be prepared for significant potential losses.
    *   **Alpha:** 61.0% - A high positive alpha suggests that Ethereum significantly outperforms its expected return based on its beta. It generates excess returns.
    *   **Beta:** 0.0 - This is highly unusual. A beta of 0.0 implies that Ethereum's price is completely uncorrelated to the overall market (S&P 500 in this case). This is unlikely in reality and may indicate an issue with the data or the model. It contradicts the earlier analysis that compares the returns of the two assets.
    *   **Cap(B):** 358.7 - This likely refers to the market capitalization in billions.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 2972.22
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 2972.22, 'previousClose': 2970.64, 'change': 0.05} - Very small price increase
*   **5-day SMA:** 2954.95
*   **20-day SMA:** 2969.10
*   **60-day SMA:** 3127.11

*   **Analysis:** The price is hovering around the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, which suggests a period of consolidation. The 60-day SMA being significantly higher suggests the price was higher in the recent past and may be in a short term down trend or sideways trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence Change, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - This suggests a favorable market environment for investment.
*   **RSI:** 54.08 - Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold. Indicates balanced buying and selling pressure.
*   **PPO:** 0.30 - Indicates a very small positive trend
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" - This is a strong buy signal generated by the hybrid system, suggesting a high confidence in Ethereum's potential. The monthly investment of 1.0% further reinforces this positive outlook.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.1 (+) "단기상승" (Short-term increase) - Indicates that Ethereum has recently started to outperform the S&P 500 again after a period of underperformance.
*   **Price Fluctuation Reflection:**  A small change from the previous close (0.05) means the fluctuation issue (sharp rebound, sharp decline) is not present at the moment.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 788.1% - This is an extremely high expected return, suggesting significant growth potential over the long term. It's important to note that such high expectations come with substantial risk.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Ethereum (ETH-USD) has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a cumulative return of 153.32% vs. 81.20%. Its CAGR of 139.0% highlights its aggressive growth potential, while the high MDD of 78.3% underscores the substantial risks involved. The high positive alpha indicates its capability to generate excess returns. The MRI suggests a favorable investment environment.

Recent price action shows consolidation, with the current price hovering around the 5-day and 20-day SMAs. The news headlines point towards positive developments, including institutional adoption, stablecoin integration, and significant investments, all contributing to a bullish outlook. However, the "Panic or Opportunity?" headline suggests recent volatility. The 788.1% expected return is very high and should be viewed with caution, acknowledging the inherent risks in cryptocurrency investments.

The most important factor to take into account is that the Beta is 0.0, meaning it's uncorrelated with the S&P 500, which contradicts some other information in the analysis.
