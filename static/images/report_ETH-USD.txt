**Analysis of Alpha, Beta:**

*   **CAGR:**  Highly volatile, ranging from negative losses to massive gains, demonstrating the high-risk, high-reward nature of Ethereum.
*   **MDD:**  Significant Maximum Drawdowns (around 70-80%) in all the periods indicate substantial price volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Fluctuating alpha demonstrates periods of high outperformance and underperformance compared to the market. High positive alpha in 2019-2021 and 2020-2022 means Ethereum significantly outperformed its benchmark.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Ethereum has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but its high volatility is a major concern. The technical indicators present a mixed picture: the recent price action is positive, with the price above its short-term moving averages, but the long-term trend, high MDD and the 60-day SMA suggests a downtrend. The MRI suggests a high level of safety in investing, while the divergence change suggests a short-term increase. The very high expected return is optimistic but speculative given the asset's history.

**Crucially, the news headlines are a mixed bag.** Some articles warn of further price declines and highlight critical support levels, while others suggest long-term potential. The article suggesting Ethereum as a "bubble risk" highlights the dangers of speculative investment.
