## ETH-USD Stock Report

**0) Summary Statistics:**

ETH-USD, representing Ethereum, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.  The provided data shows significant volatility and outperformance relative to the S&P 500 in some periods, but also considerable underperformance in others.  Currently, ETH-USD is trading below its various moving averages, suggesting bearish momentum. Indicators like RSI and PPO suggest oversold conditions, while the Market Risk Indicator points to a moderately high risk level.  The high expected return is noteworthy, but comes with considerable risk given the volatility.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (ETH-USD):** 222.697%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 28.913%
* **Return Difference (ETH-USD - VOO):** 193.8%
* **Relative Divergence:** 13.9% (This indicates the current difference lies at the 13.9th percentile of historical divergence between the two assets.)


The table below shows a highly volatile performance of ETH-USD, with large swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and substantial Maximum Drawdowns (MDD). While Alpha values fluctuate between slightly negative and slightly positive, indicating periods of both underperformance and outperformance versus the market (as proxied by the beta),  the high Beta consistently demonstrates significant market sensitivity.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows significant growth over time.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 1555.24
* **Last Market Price:** 1474.70 (a drop of -4.98 from the previous close of 1552.02) This represents a sharp, immediate decline.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 1713.78
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 1888.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 2206.79

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend. The significant drop in the last market price (-4.98) reinforces this bearish sentiment.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 15.71 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.15 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.3 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 2862.8% (This exceptionally high number should be interpreted cautiously in light of the high volatility and inherent risk.)

The combination of a high MRI, oversold RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence change suggests that the market is currently bearish.  The high expected return is intriguing,  but the substantial volatility of ETH-USD (evident in the provided CAGR and MDD data) needs to be carefully considered.  This high expected return is relative to the S&P 500 and does not guarantee a profit.   A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) mitigates some risk but doesn't eliminate the possibility of significant losses.  The recent sharp price drop further emphasizes the inherent risk.
