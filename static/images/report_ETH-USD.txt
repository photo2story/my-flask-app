## ETH-USD Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

ETH-USD, representing Ether cryptocurrency, shows significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, although recent performance has been negative.  While exhibiting high volatility and beta, its alpha suggests potential for outperformance, although this is inconsistent across different timeframes.  Current technical indicators suggest the asset is oversold but below its moving averages.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Company Overview:** ETH-USD is a cryptocurrency representing Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain.

* **Cumulative Returns:** ETH-USD showed a cumulative return of 233.42%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 43.83%. The difference is substantial (189.6%). The relative divergence (13.7%) indicates that the current outperformance is within the middle range of historical performance differentials.  This is a snapshot and doesn't reflect the volatility of ETH-USD.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha and beta values fluctuate considerably across different years, highlighting the high volatility and risk associated with ETH-USD. While alpha is generally positive, suggesting potential outperformance, the highly variable beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  The large swings in CAGR and MDD further emphasize this volatility.  Note that market cap data is also highly volatile.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 1588.63
* **Last Market Data:** Price: 1599.88, Previous Close: 1588.83, Change: 0.7 (a slight positive change)
* **Moving Averages:** 5-day: 1603.75, 20-day: 1715.32, 60-day: 2063.38. The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4133 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 34.81 (Oversold; generally, below 30 indicates oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.15 (Positive, but relatively weak)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** 0.9 (+), indicating short-term upward momentum. This needs further investigation to confirm its sustainability.
* **Price Change:** The recent 0.7% increase suggests a minor rebound but doesn't negate the overall downward trend indicated by the moving averages.  It is not a significant "rapid" increase.
* **Expected Return:** 2864.0%. This exceptionally high figure for expected return requires careful consideration.  It's crucial to understand the assumptions behind this projection and the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency investments. This high number should be treated with extreme caution given its inconsistency with historical performance.  A more conservative forecast would be advisable.


**Overall Assessment:**

ETH-USD has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but this has come with substantial volatility. Current indicators show the asset to be oversold, but the price is below its moving averages.  The very high expected return requires deep scrutiny and independent verification.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and diversify their portfolio before investing in this highly volatile asset. The provided data represents a snapshot in time, and future performance may vary significantly.
