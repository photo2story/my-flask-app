**4. Recent Performance and Outlook:**

No earnings data is available for ETH-USD, making a traditional financial analysis based on earnings impossible.  Ethereum's value is largely driven by factors outside of typical corporate earnings reports, such as blockchain adoption, regulatory changes, and technological developments.


**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data is available, as Ethereum is not a traditional company with revenue streams in the same way as publicly traded corporations.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  The prompt requests analysis of news within the last two days from sources like Shacknews and Finbold.  This information is not provided, preventing a comprehensive news analysis.  Without access to recent news articles and analyst opinions, a complete evaluation of market sentiment and performance highlights is impossible.

**7. Summary:**

ETH-USD shows a vastly different performance profile compared to the S&P 500. Its significantly higher returns over various periods come with a substantially higher risk, reflected in its elevated beta and significant maximum drawdown (MDD).  While the expected return is substantially higher than the S&P 500, the lack of traditional financial data, combined with the absence of recent news analysis, makes a thorough evaluation difficult.  The recent price drop adds complexity to the current outlook.  Further investigation into recent market news and sentiment is crucial for a complete assessment.  The extremely high volatility requires careful consideration of risk tolerance before investment.
