ETH-USD, or Ether, is a cryptocurrency and the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized platform for building and running smart contracts and decentralized applications.

The cumulative return for ETH-USD is 599.05%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 100.59%.  The difference is 498.46%, placing it at the 38.27th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a min of -73.42% and a max of 1420.79%).  The provided alpha and beta values indicate varying levels of outperformance (alpha) and market correlation (beta) over different time periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 3111.38
* **Last Market Price:** 3093.95
* **5-day Moving Average:** 3126.24
* **20-day Moving Average:** 2910.16
* **60-day Moving Average:** 2667.99

The price is currently above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  However, it's slightly below the 5-day moving average, hinting at a potential short-term correction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI:** 71.14 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.07 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** 6.87 (+) (Short-term upward trend)

The RSI suggests the asset might be overbought, indicating a potential pullback.  The positive PPO supports the bullish momentum, however. The recent positive relative divergence change reinforces the short-term upward trend. Given that the last market price (3093.95) is close to the closing price, no significant sudden price movement (sharp rise or fall) is currently apparent.  The expected return of 74.73% over the long term (2+ years) represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, assuming the current trend continues.

**4. Recent Performance and Outlook:**

No earnings data is available for ETH-USD as it's a cryptocurrency, not a publicly traded company in the traditional sense.  Therefore, traditional financial statement analysis is not applicable.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

Unfortunately,  I do not have access to real-time information, including news sources like Shacknews or Finbold, to provide you with the most recent news and analyst opinions within the past two days. To get this information, you should consult financial news websites directly.  A search for "ETH-USD news" on Google or your preferred financial news site will provide up-to-date information.

**7. Summary:**

ETH-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, though the performance has varied across different periods. While recent technical indicators suggest a potential short-term pullback due to overbought conditions (RSI), the overall trend seems bullish (PPO, Relative Divergence, Price above moving averages). However, the lack of traditional financial data makes a full fundamental analysis impossible.   The long-term outlook is positive based on the projected outperformance against the S&P 500, but this is contingent on future market conditions and the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies.  Consult real-time news and analyst opinions for the most current perspective.  Remember that cryptocurrency investments are highly speculative and carry significant risk.
