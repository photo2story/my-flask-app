**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 2345.51
* **Last Market Price:** 2521.88
* **Previous Close:** 2583.42
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 1999.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 1830.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 1811.76

The price is currently below its recent averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The substantial drop from the previous close (-2.38%) points to a recent, relatively sharp decline.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 89.24 (Extremely overbought, suggesting a potential price reversal)
* **PPO:** 2.87 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, though RSI suggests this might be unsustainable)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1589.2% (Long-term, 2+ years, significantly higher than S&P 500)

The high RSI value (89.24) strongly indicates that the asset is overbought, implying a high probability of a price correction in the near term.  While the PPO suggests bullish momentum, this contradicts the extremely overbought RSI, creating a warning sign.  The recent price drop further supports this caution. The high expected return should be viewed cautiously given the substantial volatility and current overbought conditions.


**Overall:**

ETH-USD has shown exceptional returns historically compared to the S&P 500, but its current price is significantly overbought,  accompanied by a recent price drop. Investors should be aware of the considerable risk associated with the high volatility and the potential for a significant price correction.  While the long-term expected return is substantial,  it's crucial to manage risk and consider dollar-cost averaging rather than investing a lump sum given the current conditions.
