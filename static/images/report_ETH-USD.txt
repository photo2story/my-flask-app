## ETH-USD Performance Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

ETH-USD, representing Ether cryptocurrency, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, exhibiting substantial volatility. However, recent performance shows a decline, with indicators suggesting oversold conditions but uncertainty regarding future direction.  Long-term investment prospects remain positive relative to the S&P 500, according to the provided data.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ETH-USD shows a cumulative return of 466.47%, drastically exceeding the S&P 500's 97.43% return.  The relative divergence metric indicates ETH-USD's performance is currently at the 28.6th percentile relative to its historical range of performance compared to the S&P 500 (ranging from a 73.5% underperformance to a 1475.3% overperformance).  This highlights its substantial volatility and periods of both extreme outperformance and underperformance against the benchmark.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and inconsistent performance across different periods.  While some periods show strong alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others display negative returns,  suggesting  significant risk. The beta fluctuates, demonstrating varying sensitivity to market movements depending on the timeframe.  High beta values indicate higher risk in line with the substantial price swings observed.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

ETH-USD's price shows a recent decline.  The price is below both its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, and significantly below its 60-day moving average, indicating a bearish trend.

* **Closing Price:** 2661.1667
* **Last Market Price:** 2607.58
* **5-Day MA:** 2646.56
* **20-Day MA:** 2999.01
* **60-Day MA:** 3300.89

The last market price shows a drop of approximately 2.03% from the previous close.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (28.1):**  Indicates the asset is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce.

* **PPO (-1.34):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-3.2):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength against the benchmark. This aligns with the price decline observed.

* **Expected Return (1015.8%):**  Suggests a significant potential for outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), given continued positive long-term trends.  This is a high-risk, high-reward proposition, however, due to the inherent volatility.

The recent price drop (-2.03%) is notable but doesn't, in itself, signify a drastic or unexpected event.  Further analysis and consideration of market conditions are needed for informed investment decisions.  The oversold condition, combined with a long-term positive outlook, creates a complex scenario that requires careful evaluation.
