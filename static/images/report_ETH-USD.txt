2025-10-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Ethereum (ETH-USD) based on the data you provided.

## Ethereum (ETH-USD) Analysis

**Company Overview:** Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform featuring smart contract functionality.

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **Ticker:** ETH-USD
*   **Cumulative Return (ETH-USD):** 253.64%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 78.08%
*   **Spread (ETH-USD vs. VOO):**
    *   **Current:** 177.5
    *   **Max:** 740.2
    *   **Min:** -67.5
    *   **Relative Spread:** 30.3

**Analysis:** Ethereum has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return. However, the relative spread indicates that while ETH-USD is currently outperforming, it's relatively closer to its historical underperformance range than its peak outperformance. This suggests that while the outperformance is significant, the magnitude has reduced compared to its peak.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -56.0%  | 78.3% | -64.0%  | 0.0  | 15.6   |
| 2018-2020  | 24.0%   | 78.3% | 1.0%    | 0.0  | 88.6   |
| 2019-2021  | 505.0%  | 76.1% | 458.0%  | 0.0  | 442.3  |
| 2020-2022  | 118.0%  | 76.1% | 119.0%  | 0.0  | 143.7  |
| 2021-2023  | -92.0%  | 73.1% | -94.0%  | 0.1  | 274.0  |
| 2022-2024  | -72.0%  | 73.1% | -92.0%  | 0.1  | 400.2  |
| 2023-2025  | 90.0%   | 79.9% | 26.0%   | 0.3  | 465.6  |

**Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals several key points:

*   **High Volatility:** ETH-USD exhibits substantial volatility, with significant swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different periods.
*   **Alpha Variation:** Alpha, which represents excess return relative to the market, fluctuates widely. In periods of strong performance (e.g., 2019-2021), Alpha is very high, indicating significant outperformance. Conversely, during downturns (e.g., 2021-2023), Alpha is deeply negative.
*   **Low Beta:** Beta values are generally low, suggesting that ETH-USD's price movements are not strongly correlated with the broader market (S&P 500).
*   **Market Cap Growth:** Market capitalization has generally increased over time, indicating overall growth in investor interest and asset value, despite periods of price decline.
*   **Recent Period:** The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a rebound with a positive CAGR and Alpha, but also a higher Beta, indicating increased correlation with the market.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 3876.76
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 3856.709, 'previousClose': 3806.6875, 'change': 1.31}
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 3890.17
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 4138.34
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 4309.70

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, indicating a short-term downtrend.
*   The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day moving average, which is below the 60-day moving average, confirming a downtrend in the medium term as well.
*   The last market data shows a positive change, indicating a minor rebound, but it's not substantial enough to reverse the overall downtrend.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 31.49 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.57
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_78%_Sell 78.4% of holdings (69 shares - Risky - MRI:0.50) (Cash Ratio: 78% on 2025-10-16)
*   **20-day Relative Spread Change:** -3.2 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 384.9% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI suggests that, based on the model, the overall market conditions are favorable for investment. However, it's important to note that this doesn't guarantee positive returns for all assets.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 31.49 indicates that Ethereum is currently oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity, assuming a reversion to the mean.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, reinforcing the downtrend signal.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends selling a significant portion of holdings and increasing the cash ratio to 78%, indicating a risk-averse strategy.
*   **Relative Spread Change:** The negative change in relative spread over the past 20 days confirms the short-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return suggests that, based on the model, Ethereum is projected to significantly outperform the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if a dollar-cost averaging strategy is employed.

*   **Last-Market Data:** The positive change in the last market data indicates a potential issue with the model's risk assessment, particularly if the price change is substantial relative to the recent downtrend.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

The provided news headlines are unrelated to Ethereum and its performance:

*   **Ohtani/Dodgers:** Sports news, irrelevant.
*   **Netflix Analyst:** Stock analysis of a different company, irrelevant.
*   **NYC Mayor Race:** Political news, irrelevant.
*   **HanchorBio Clinical Results:** Biotech news, irrelevant.
*   **Brandywine Realty Trust:** Real estate news, irrelevant.
*   **NFL News:** Sports news, irrelevant.

The lack of relevant news makes it difficult to directly correlate recent events with Ethereum's price action.

### 5. Overall Summary & Recommendation

Ethereum has demonstrated substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500 historically, but recent price action and technical indicators suggest a short-term downtrend. The high MRI score contradicts the hybrid signal.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Risk Management:** The hybrid signal suggests a cautious approach, recommending a significant reduction in holdings. Given the recent downtrend and oversold conditions, consider reducing exposure.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** The high expected return and the underlying technology's potential justify maintaining a position in Ethereum, especially for investors with a long-term horizon and a dollar-cost averaging strategy. However, this should be balanced with the need for risk management.
*   **Monitor News:** Stay informed about relevant news and developments in the cryptocurrency space that could impact Ethereum's price.
*   **Caution on MRI and Last-Market Data:** Investigate the reasons for the high MRI score despite the negative market indicators. Additionally, assess the magnitude and impact of the last-market data's positive change in light of the overall downtrend.

In summary, Ethereum presents a complex investment picture, with both significant potential and considerable risk. A balanced approach that combines risk management with a long-term perspective is recommended.
