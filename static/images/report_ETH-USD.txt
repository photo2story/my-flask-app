## ETH-USD Investment Report

**0. Executive Summary:** ETH-USD, representing Ether cryptocurrency, shows significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, but with substantial volatility as reflected in high maximum drawdown (MDD) and fluctuating alpha and beta.  Recent price action suggests a bearish trend, but long-term projections indicate a substantial potential for outperformance relative to the S&P 500.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

ETH-USD is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, a decentralized platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).

**Cumulative Return Comparison:**

* **ETH-USD:** 568.81%
* **VOO (S&P 500):** 97.33%

The cumulative return of ETH-USD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500.  The provided divergence metrics (max: 1475.3, min: -73.5, current: 471.5, relative divergence: 35.2%) show ETH-USD's performance relative to the S&P 500 has varied considerably, currently sitting at the 35.2nd percentile of historical divergence.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided table shows highly volatile alpha and beta coefficients across different periods.  This suggests a high degree of correlation with the broader market (beta) in some periods, but also significant periods of independent performance (alpha). The high MDD values across various timeframes highlight the substantial risk associated with ETH-USD investments.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -83.0%    | 50.4% | -99.0% | 0.0   | 16.2   |

| 2019-2021  | 1201.0%  | 38.8% | 1130.0%| 0.1   | 461.7  |
| 2020-2022  | 259.0%   | 44.7% | 250.0% | 0.1   | 150.3  |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 3112.99
* **Last Market Price:** 3404.09 (showing a recent increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 3184.49
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 3266.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 3493.15

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a short-term bearish trend.  The recent market price shows a significant jump compared to the previous close suggesting a potential short-term rebound.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 35.72  (Suggests the asset is in oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.46 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Divergence (20-day):** -1.6% (Short-term bearish trend)

The RSI being below 30 and the negative PPO confirm the bearish short-term sentiment.  The recent price jump from the previous close ('Last-market') suggests a potential short-term reversal of this bearish momentum, though the moving averages and overall picture remain negative.


**Expected Return:**

The expected return of 753.7% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 represents a significant potential for outperformance, but is subject to considerable risk given the historical volatility of ETH-USD. This high expected return should be considered in light of the substantial risk involved, as indicated by the high MDD values in the historical data.  The high volatility means that actual returns could differ significantly from this projection.
