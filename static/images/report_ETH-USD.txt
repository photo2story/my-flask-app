## ETH-USD Report

**0. Overview:**

ETH-USD, representing Ethereum, is a decentralized, open-source blockchain featuring smart contract functionality.  The following analysis uses provided data to assess its performance and potential.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The cumulative return for ETH-USD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  Specifically:

* **ETH-USD Cumulative Return:** 312.23%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 82.37%
* **Difference:** 229.9 percentage points.  This places the relative divergence at the 20th percentile based on historical data (max: 1445.8, min: -74.8).  This high relative divergence indicates that ETH-USD has historically outperformed VOO, but this doesn't guarantee future performance.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance across different periods.  While some periods show extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others exhibit significant negative returns.  The high beta values (especially in 2018-2020) suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements. Note that the Beta values are extremely high in several periods, indicating high sensitivity to market movements.


| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -55.0%   | 43.6%   | -72.0% | 0.0   | 15.8   |
| 2018-2020  | 94.0%   | 43.6%   | 67.0%  | 0.0   | 90.2   |
| 2019-2021  | 1181.0% | 38.8%   | 1110.0%| 0.2   | 450.5  |
| 2020-2022  | 256.0%  | 44.7%   | 248.0% | 0.1   | 146.7  |
| 2021-2023  | -8.0%   | 44.7%   | -32.0% | 0.5   | 281.4  |
| 2022-2024  | -158.0% | 44.7%   | -191.0%| 0.5   | 407.6  |
| 2023-2025  | -26.0%  | 32.1%   | -72.0% | 0.5   | 240.3  |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 1964.85
* **Last Market Price:** 1992.30
* **5-day Moving Average:** 1972.85
* **20-day Moving Average:** 2039.36
* **60-day Moving Average:** 2556.77

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend.  The recent price increase from the previous close (0.61%) might indicate a short-term bounce.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.39 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 1.11 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1581.3% (This is a significant and potentially unrealistic figure.  It needs further clarification on its calculation methodology and underlying assumptions before it can be considered reliable.  The claim that this is "S&P 500 relative return" requires significant explanation and justification. Is it an annualized return? What time horizon is this projection based on?)


The recent price increase of 0.61% is not significant enough to be classified as a sharp uptrend or downtrend. The combination of indicators presents a mixed signal. While the RSI suggests a potential oversold condition and the PPO indicates upward momentum, the price is still below its moving averages, and the high historical volatility highlights the risk.

**Conclusion:**

ETH-USD has historically shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500,  but this has been accompanied by considerable volatility. The current technical indicators suggest a potentially mixed outlook. The extremely high projected long-term expected return requires further validation and context. Investors should proceed with caution, considering the high risk associated with this asset and the need for careful risk management.  Further analysis using a longer historical data set, different methodologies for calculating expected return, and considering other relevant macroeconomic factors is strongly recommended.
