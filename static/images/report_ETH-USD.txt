**Analysis:**

*   ETH-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered, as indicated by the substantial cumulative return difference.
*   The Relative Divergence suggests the outperformance is not at its historical extreme, indicating potential for further upside, though context is needed.
*   **Alpha and Beta:**  The table shows high Alpha values in periods of strong growth (e.g., 2019-2021), indicating ETH-USD's return significantly exceeds what is predicted by the market (S&P 500).  Beta values are consistently low (close to 0) or low (0.1~0.3), suggesting ETH-USD has not been very correlated with the S&P 500's movements (though this may vary depending on the time frame). High volatility and market cycles appear to have the biggest influence.
*   **CAGR & MDD:**  CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies wildly, highlighting ETH-USD's volatile nature.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, reflecting the inherent risk in cryptocurrency investments.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 2979.90
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 2978.92, Previous Close: 2950.67, Change: 0.96% (Indicates a slight positive movement in the last trading session)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 2772.16
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 2540.06
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 2554.83

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is above all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), generally suggesting an upward trend.
*   The 5-day MA being above the 20-day MA and the 60-day MA further supports this short-term bullish sentiment.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3294 (Classified as Low Risk)
*   **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** 77.41 (Overbought territory)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 2.09 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34)" (Suggests a buy signal, but with caution due to the MRI value).
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 1.7 (+) (Indicates short-term upward momentum relative to the S&P 500)
*   **Expected Return:** 1416.5% (Long-term projected outperformance vs. S&P 500 if investing from the current point)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI being in the "Low Risk" range is somewhat contradictory given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. This could be specific to the model used to calculate the MRI.
*   The RSI being in overbought territory (above 70) suggests the asset might be due for a pullback or consolidation.
*   The PPO confirms the bullish momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a cautious buy, balancing potential upside with risk awareness.
*   The significant expected return indicates substantial potential upside over the long term (2+ years), but this should be viewed with caution given the historical volatility of ETH-USD.

### 5. Overall Summary & Recommendation

Based on the provided data:

*   **ETH-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically,** but this outperformance is not currently at its peak relative to past patterns.
*   **Recent price action is bullish,** with the price above key moving averages.
*   **The RSI indicates overbought conditions,** suggesting a potential pullback.
*   **The Market Risk Indicator is surprisingly low,** which should be viewed with caution given the volatile nature of cryptocurrency and historical MDD.
*   **News events are driving volatility,** and monitoring specific developments is essential.
*   **The long-term expected return is very high,** but this should be balanced against the asset's inherent risk.

**Recommendation:**

A cautious buy approach seems appropriate. Consider the Hybrid Signal recommendation of buying 80% of your intended allocation. Due to overbought conditions, consider layering into a position rather than deploying all capital at once. Closely monitor news and regulatory developments, as these can have a significant impact on ETH-USD's price. This is not financial advice. Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky, and investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before investing.
