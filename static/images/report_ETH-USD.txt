## ETH-USD Performance Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

ETH-USD, or Ether, is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain platform.  The provided data shows significantly higher cumulative returns for ETH-USD compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), but with considerable volatility.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **ETH-USD Cumulative Return:** 396.45%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 93.72%
* **Return Difference:** 302.7% (This is the difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 24.3% (This indicates that the current difference between ETH-USD and VOO's returns falls within the 24.3rd percentile of historical divergence, meaning it has been higher in the past).

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows highly variable performance across different time periods.  High CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is offset by significant maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The volatile nature of ETH-USD is clearly illustrated.  Alpha values are mostly low, suggesting limited ability to outperform the market (though these periods are short-term). Beta fluctuates indicating shifting correlation with the market.  Market capitalization increases significantly over time.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 2331.45
* **Last Market Price:** 2117.63 (a significant drop from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 2584.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 2654.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 3056.92

The last market price shows a notable decrease from the previous close, indicating a recent downward trend. All moving averages are considerably higher than the current price, reinforcing the bearish signal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 32.08 (This suggests the asset is currently in oversold territory.)
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.48 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.8% (This confirms a short-term downward trend.)
* **Last Market Change:** The significant negative change (-8.15%) indicates a potential sharp drop.  This should be carefully considered.

The provided last market data strongly suggests a recent sharp decline in ETH-USD price.

* **Expected Return:** 1261.5% This represents a very optimistic long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500.  This should be treated with considerable skepticism given the high volatility and risk inherent in cryptocurrency investments.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Conclusion:**

While ETH-USD has historically outperformed the S&P 500, its volatility is a significant concern.  The current price action, supported by technical indicators, suggests a bearish trend.  The extremely high expected return should be viewed with caution; it does not account for potential extreme losses during the investment period.  Any investment decision should consider risk tolerance and diversification strategies.
