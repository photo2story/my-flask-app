*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD indicates substantial risk and price declines at times.
*   **Alpha:**  Positive alpha in the more recent periods (2022-2024, 2023-2025) shows that HIMS is generating returns above what would be expected based on its beta.

*   20-day SMA: 36.06
*   60-day SMA: 41.59

**Analysis:** The stock price closed at 33.41 but the last market was traded at 34.71 (+3.89 fluctuation), meaning it closed much lower than the potential price. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating a recent downward trend. The fact that the 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA reinforces this downward trend.

*   RSI: 25.88 (Oversold)
*   PPO: -0.33 (Negative, but close to zero)

*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -1.7 (Negative, indicating short-term decline)
*   Expected Return (%): 45.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Indicates a medium level of investment risk based on the historical data.
*   **RSI:** The RSI value of 25.88 suggests that the stock is currently oversold and may be due for a rebound.
*   **PPO:**  The PPO is slightly negative, indicating that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, confirming the downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends buying the stock with 100% of available cash, indicating confidence based on a "Very Safe" rating and a high MRI score (0.90). It suggests a monthly investment of 1.3%.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** A 45.6% expected return is very optimistic and suggests significant upside potential if held long-term (more than 2 years).

The expansion into Canada and the share repurchase program are positive catalysts.  The mixed signals of insider selling versus institutional buying warrant further investigation.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

HIMS presents a mixed picture:

*   **Positives:** Strong historical outperformance vs. S&P 500, positive alpha in recent periods, increasing revenue, high profit margins, growth initiatives (Canadian expansion, share repurchase), and a buy recommendation from the Hybrid Signal based on a 'very safe' rating.
*   **Negatives:** High volatility (high beta and MDD), recent stock pullback, declining EPS, decreasing ROE, downward price trend (SMA analysis), and mixed analyst opinions.

**Conclusion:**

HIMS appears to be a high-growth, high-risk stock. The recent pullback may present a buying opportunity for long-term investors who are comfortable with volatility. However, the declining EPS and ROE, downward trend, and mixed analyst sentiment warrant caution. The extremely optimistic expected return (45.6%) should be viewed with skepticism, as it is based on projections and is not guaranteed. The stock may be a good fit for aggressive growth portfolios, but investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing. They should investigate the reasons for the recent EPS and ROE decline to understand if they are temporary or indicative of a more serious problem.
