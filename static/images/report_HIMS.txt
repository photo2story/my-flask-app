Hims & Hers Health Inc. (HIMS) has demonstrated strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the past, particularly in recent periods.  The company exhibits high revenue growth and strong profit margins.

Critically, the expected return is currently negative, indicating potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals – strong growth and profitability alongside high volatility and a negative expected return – a **cautious approach is warranted.**

*   **If already holding HIMS:** The hybrid signal suggests reducing exposure slightly and increasing your cash position.
*   **If considering investing:**  Conduct thorough due diligence, carefully consider your risk tolerance, and monitor upcoming news and earnings releases. The negative expected return is a significant concern that needs to be further investigated.
