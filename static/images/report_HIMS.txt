**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출       |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-11-03 | 0.07  | 0.60 B$    |
| 2025-08-04 | 0.19  | 0.54 B$    |

| 2025-11-03 | 0.35  | 0.40 B$    |

**Analysis:**

* There appears to be an error in the table, with 2024-11-04 and 2025-11-03 having identical values. Assuming that 2024 data is correct, the earnings per share (EPS) is decreased in 2025.
* The latest revenue (2025-11-03) shows revenue has increased, but EPS has decreased compared to previous periods. This suggests that although the company is selling more, it may be experiencing increased expenses, impacting its profitability.
