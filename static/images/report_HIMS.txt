**1. Performance Comparison and Company Overview:**

Hims & Hers Health Inc. is a telehealth company providing personalized healthcare products and services.  Over the period analyzed, HIMS significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 180.75% compared to VOO's 33.88%. The relative divergence of 63.5% highlights that this outperformance is substantial relative to the historical range of outperformance and underperformance.  However,  it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in performance across different years, ranging from negative returns to very high positive returns.  The high beta values (generally above 1) suggest HIMS is more volatile than the overall market.  The negative alpha values consistently indicate underperformance relative to the market after adjusting for risk (beta).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $40.82
* **5-day Moving Average:** $34.72
* **20-day Moving Average:** $29.15
* **60-day Moving Average:** $36.66

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential uptrend.  The significant daily change (12.89%) indicates recent volatility and a sharp price increase.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 75.79 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 5.60 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +22.7% (Short-term uptrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -14.1% (This suggests that despite the recent outperformance, the model predicts HIMS may underperform the S&P 500 over the long term relative to the market.  It's important to note that long-term predictions are subject to significant uncertainty)

The recent sharp price increase ('Last-market' data showing a 12.89% change) suggests a potential short-term overbought condition.  The high RSI confirms this. While the PPO is positive, the negative expected return and overbought RSI suggest caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|

| 2024-08-05 | $0.06 | $0.32 B     |
| 2024-05-06 | $0.05 | $0.28 B     |

| 2024-11-04 | -$0.04| $0.23 B     |

There seems to be a duplication in the data for November 2024.  Assuming the first entry is correct, earnings have shown substantial growth in the last quarter (Q4 2024), with EPS increasing significantly and revenue also increasing.  However, prior quarters exhibit lower profitability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

HIMS has demonstrated significant past outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this outperformance is coupled with high volatility and negative alpha, indicating that the outperformance may not be entirely due to superior stock selection. Recent earnings show strong growth, and financial information displays high profit margins and increasing revenue.  However, the high RSI, and negative projected long-term return,  combined with  the high beta, suggest a high risk profile.  Investors should proceed with caution and carefully consider the risks before investing in HIMS, especially given the high volatility displayed in historical data.  Further research into the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape is recommended.
