**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Hims & Hers Health Inc. is a telehealth company offering personalized healthcare products and services.  HIMS significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return vastly exceeding that of the benchmark index. While the current relative divergence of 63.5% indicates strong historical outperformance, it's crucial to consider this within the context of its historical volatility.


**2. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show HIMS exhibiting high volatility (high beta) and generally negative alpha, implying underperformance relative to the market risk-adjusted return, except in the most recent periods (2022-2025). This suggests that while returns have been high recently, significant risk is involved.  The increasing beta over time indicates increasing sensitivity to market movements.

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2019-2021  | -46.0% | 51.0% | -76.0% | 1.5   |       |
| 2020-2022  | -15.0% | 72.1% | -19.0% | 1.4   |       |
| 2021-2023  | -51.0% | 72.1% | -63.0% | 2.0   |       |
| 2022-2024  | 127.0% | 78.4% | 111.0% | 5.4   |       |
| 2023-2025  | 176.0% | 78.4% | 157.0% | 9.1   |       |


**3. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($40.82) is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance at higher price levels.

**4. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 75.79 suggests the stock is in overbought territory, implying a potential pullback.  The positive PPO value confirms bullish momentum, but this should be interpreted cautiously in light of the high RSI. The recent increase in relative divergence (22.7%) supports the short-term upward trend.  The MRI of 0.3776 indicates medium risk.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue    |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-05-05 | 0.22  | 0.59 B$    |
| 2024-11-04 | 0.35  | 0.40 B$    |
| 2024-08-05 | 0.06  | 0.32 B$    |
| 2024-05-06 | 0.05  | 0.28 B$    |
| 2024-05-05 | 0.05  | 0.28 B$    |


Revenue is showing a clear upward trend, with a significant increase in the most recent quarter. EPS also exhibits growth, particularly in the latest two periods.  However, further analysis of revenue and EPS data is required, particularly missing data.


**6. Financial Information:**

The absence of crucial financial data like Total Revenue and Gross Profit significantly hinders a complete financial analysis. This information is essential for evaluating the company's profitability and financial health.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

HIMS has shown remarkable growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this is coupled with high volatility and negative alpha (except recent periods) and an overbought RSI, suggesting caution.  The lack of complete financial data limits a thorough assessment.  The positive revenue and EPS trends are encouraging, but the high risk and -14.1% expected return against VOO over the long term suggest a potentially risky investment, even with a long-term outlook.  Further research, including the missing financial data, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Considering the high volatility, investors should be prepared for potential significant price swings.
