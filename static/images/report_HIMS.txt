| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 2019-2021  | -46.0% | 51.0%  | -84.0% | -0.0   | 1.5    |
| 2020-2022  | -15.0% | 72.1%  | -17.0% | -0.0   | 1.4    |

| 2023-2025  | 159.0% | 78.4%  | 110.0% | -0.1   | 10.7   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows highly variable performance across different periods, with significant negative growth in earlier periods (2019-2023) and very strong positive growth in recent periods (2022-2025). This suggests a period of high volatility and then a strong recovery and growth phase.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant downside risk. This is particularly important to consider given the volatile nature of the stock.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are extremely volatile. Initially, the negative Alpha suggests underperformance compared to the benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis. However, in recent periods (2022-2025), the Alpha turns strongly positive, indicating substantial outperformance relative to the risk taken.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are close to zero or negative, suggesting a very low correlation with the overall market (S&P 500). This could indicate that HIMS's stock performance is largely independent of broader market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has increased significantly, especially in the later periods, reflecting the company's growth.

**Analysis:**

The recent price decline (-\$5.52) is significant and is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This suggests a short-term downtrend. The price falling below the 20-day moving average is a bearish signal.  The large change from the previous close indicates substantial selling pressure.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a *Low Risk* environment.
*   **RSI:**  The RSI of 44.94 is nearing oversold territory (typically below 30), suggesting potential for a bounce.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.0995 indicates that the 20-day EMA is still above the 60-day EMA, indicating a possible bullish signal, although this signal should be considered with other parameters since other parameters are bearish.

**Analysis:**

*   **Equity Growth:**  Equity is growing, indicating the company is retaining earnings and/or raising capital effectively.
*   **ROE Volatility:** Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile. The recent decline in ROE despite equity growth suggests that the company's ability to generate profit from equity is weakening, possibly due to the declining profit margins.

### 7. Overall Summary and Conclusion

Hims & Hers Health Inc. (HIMS) exhibits a mixed profile:

*   **Positives:** Significant historical outperformance vs. the S\&P 500, strong revenue growth, recent positive alpha, and increasing market capitalization.
*   **Negatives:** High volatility (MDD), declining profit margins and ROE, recent stock price decline, and a negative long-term expected return based on the provided model.

**Key Considerations:**

*   The company's high growth comes with high volatility and risk, as indicated by the large MDD and fluctuating Alpha values.
*   The declining profit margins and ROE are concerning and warrant further investigation. Are these temporary, or do they reflect a fundamental shift in the company's business model?
*   The recent price decline, while potentially a buying opportunity, should be viewed with caution given the other negative indicators.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a neutral to cautious stance is warranted. Monitor the company's earnings reports, profit margins, and guidance closely.  The news flow indicates a dynamic situation, requiring constant evaluation of the company's prospects.  The technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce, but the negative expected return and declining profitability metrics raise concerns about long-term investment.
