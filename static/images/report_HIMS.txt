**0) Report Structure:**

*   First, the basic data points are presented numerically.
*   Then, a simple analysis of each section is provided.
*   Finally, a comprehensive summary tying everything together is presented.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (HIMS vs. VOO):**

*   **HIMS Overview:** Hims & Hers Health Inc. is a telehealth company providing personalized health and wellness solutions.

*   **Cumulative Returns:**
    *   HIMS: 114.24%
    *   VOO (S&P 500): 69.64%

*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 44.6
    *   Relative Divergence: 31.4 (This indicates the divergence is in the lower part of its historical range.)

*   **Analysis:** HIMS has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return. However, the relative divergence suggests that this outperformance, while substantial, is currently not as extreme as it has been historically within the dataset's tracked range.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -19.0%   | 67.1% | -17.0%   | 0.7    | 1.5    |
| 2021-2023  | -65.0%   | 67.1% | -66.0%   | 1.6    | 2.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 119.0%   | 42.0% | 99.0%    | 1.7    | 5.5    |
| 2023-2025  | 114.0%   | 57.5% | 52.0%    | 2.1    | 7.4    |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows a stark contrast between negative returns in earlier periods and substantial growth in the more recent 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods.
    *   **MDD:** The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is high, indicating significant volatility and potential risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally positive recently, suggesting HIMS is generating returns above what would be expected based on its beta.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta is consistently above 1, indicating HIMS is more volatile than the overall market (S&P 500). The increasing beta also suggests the stocks correlation is increasing.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 33.41
*   **Last-market:** price': 33.41, 'previousClose': 32.47, 'change': 2.89 (This shows a recent positive change.)
*   **5-day SMA:** 33.466
*   **20-day SMA:** 36.064
*   **60-day SMA:** 41.5878

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). The 5-day SMA is roughly around the price, with a recent market activity that showed upward activity. This suggests the price might be in a short-term consolidation phase, with potential for further decline or stabilization.

**3) Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 25.88 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.33 (Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (26 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) - This signal suggests a buying opportunity, likely based on the oversold conditions.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.7 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 45.6% (Long-term projection exceeding S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:** The RSI indicates that HIMS is currently oversold, which often precedes a price correction upwards. The PPO being negative supports a bearish short-term trend. The MRI suggesting "Medium Investment" is somewhat contradictory, given the other indicators, but it might be factoring in longer-term growth potential. The expected return of 45.6% is high, indicating potential optimism about future performance if held long-term.

    *   Recent Rating Changes: Not available in provided data.

*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus target price suggests potential for growth, but the wide range highlights the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future performance. The lack of recent rating changes limits the insight into current analyst sentiment.
