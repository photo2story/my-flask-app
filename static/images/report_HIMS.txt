**Report on Hims & Hers Health Inc. (HIMS)**

**0. Executive Summary**

Hims & Hers Health Inc. (HIMS) is a telehealth company that provides personalized health and wellness solutions. The stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) recently, but has demonstrated very high volatility and growth. Recent news and analyst opinions suggest a mixed outlook, with both positive momentum and potential concerns regarding regulatory scrutiny.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** HIMS
*   **Company:** Hims & Hers Health Inc.
*   **Description:** A telehealth company providing personalized health and wellness solutions.
*   **HIMS Cumulative Return:** 281.43%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 73.57%
*   **Absolute Divergence (Current):** 172.1
*   **Relative Divergence (Current):** 63.3

**Analysis:** HIMS has significantly outperformed VOO. The relative divergence of 63.3 indicates that HIMS's performance is positioned in the upper range of its historical divergence from the S&P 500.  This suggests potentially high past returns, but does not guarantee future performance.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -42.0% | 74.4% | -81.0% | 0.0   | 1.5    |

| 2023-2025  | 286.0% | 80.8% | 222.0% | 0.1   | 13.2   |

**Analysis:** The table shows HIMS's performance characteristics over rolling three-year periods.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates significantly, with negative values in earlier periods and exceptionally high growth in the most recent period (2023-2025). MDD (Maximum Drawdown) remains consistently high, indicating substantial risk. Alpha is also volatile, but shows a very strong positive value in the latest period, meaning HIMS far exceeded its benchmark during that time. Beta fluctuates around 0, suggesting HIMS's price movement is not as correlated with the overall market (S&P 500) with high volatility

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** $58.17
*   **Previous Close:** $57.97
*   **Change:** +$0.35 (Slight increase)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 56.262
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 55.2967
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 52.0599

**Analysis:** The stock is trading above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. The small price increase from the previous close ($0.35) indicates some positive momentum, but it is not a dramatic jump.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Signals**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 53.80 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.0126 (Potentially Bullish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (17 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.3% of total investment ($1,000.00)"
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -10.7 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 2.2% (Outperformance vs. S&P 500 in long-term)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, while the neutral RSI indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The positive PPO hints at potential bullish momentum. The hybrid signal suggests allocating all available cash to buy 17 shares, combined with monthly investment. The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days indicates recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  The expected return of 2.2% indicates projected long-term outperformance vs. the S&P 500.

The small price change from the previous close (+$0.35) doesn't suggest any major sudden change, so no specific volatility issues need highlighting.
