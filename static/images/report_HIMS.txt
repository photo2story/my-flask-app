2025-12-06 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's an analysis of Hims & Hers Health Inc. based on the provided data, broken down into sections with simple numbers and then analysis.

**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **HIMS:** Hims & Hers Health Inc. is a telehealth company focused on providing personalized health and wellness solutions.
*   **HIMS Cumulative Return:** 139.33%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 75.23%
*   **Divergence:** 82.8
*   **Relative Divergence:** 41.4

**Analysis:**

HIMS has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in cumulative return. The divergence of 82.8 indicates a substantial difference in performance. However, the relative divergence of 41.4 suggests that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range. The provided Alpha/Beta analysis is concerning. The company has had periods of significant underperformance versus the market (negative Alpha) despite exhibiting a Beta generally around 0 or slightly positive. This suggests that HIMS's performance is more driven by idiosyncratic factors than overall market movements. More recent results are more positive.

*   **60-day SMA:** $47.81

**Analysis:**

The stock price is currently below both its 5-day and 20-day simple moving averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downtrend. It is also far below the 60-day SMA, indicating that the recent price weakness is a departure from a longer-term upward trend.

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 7.5 (+) (short-term rise)

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Share Repurchase Program:** A $250 million share repurchase program was authorized (potentially boosting stock price).
*   **Stock Plunge:** A report indicated a significant drop (15.6%) in the stock price over 3 months (potentially due to lockup expiration and increased concerns with macroeconomics).

*   **Canadian Expansion:** HIMS has a new market opportunity in Canada.
*   **Past Surge:** A report questions if it's too late to invest after a significant surge in the past three years.

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed. While the share repurchase program and expansion into new markets are positive signals, the reported stock plunge and questioning of its valuation after a surge raise concerns. The focus on the obesity business and the success of the biotech bet are also promising developments.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 3.00 (Hold)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** $44.36 / $85.00 / $25.00

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is a "Hold" rating, suggesting a neutral outlook. The average target price of $44.36 represents a potential upside from the current price, but the wide range between the high and low targets indicates significant uncertainty among analysts.
