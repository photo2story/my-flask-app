|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|---------|

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $29.15

**5. Financial Information:**

No detailed financial information (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) was available, limiting a comprehensive financial health assessment.  This is a significant gap in the provided data.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

HIMS exhibits a history of high volatility and periods of significant underperformance. However, recent performance shows a remarkable turnaround with substantial growth and outperformance relative to the S&P 500. The high RSI and relative divergence suggest potential short-term overvaluation, while the positive PPO indicates continued upward momentum.  The discrepancy between the historical outperformance and the projected negative expected return needs clarification.  The lack of comprehensive financial data severely hinders a complete assessment.  Further investigation into the sustainability of recent earnings growth, the reasons behind the negative expected return, and a thorough analysis of the financial statements are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current situation is highly volatile, and investors should proceed with caution.
