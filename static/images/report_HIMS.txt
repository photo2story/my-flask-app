The data shows high volatility and negative alpha in most periods, suggesting underperformance relative to the market, except for 2022-2024.  The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.4% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -34.0% (This indicates a significant negative expected return, potentially reflecting market sentiment and risk assessment).  This is a substantial negative expected return; however, the context of this being the expected return for *long-term investment* (2+ years) in relation to the S&P 500 needs to be considered.  It may reflect a discounted valuation relative to the market's expectation of S&P 500 growth.

The recent price jump of 5.35% needs further investigation to determine if this is a sustained trend reversal or a temporary fluctuation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

HIMS shows high growth potential, evidenced by strong revenue and profit margin growth.  However, the stock exhibits significant volatility and has historically underperformed the market (except for a specific period). The recent price jump needs careful monitoring to determine if it's a sustainable trend. The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500, even for long-term investment, suggests that despite the impressive growth in financials, the market has not yet fully embraced the long-term positive growth outlook.  Further investigation into the company's fundamentals, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high beta suggests that any market downturn would significantly impact the stock's price.  Investors should carefully weigh the risk-reward profile before investing.  The duplicate earnings data point requires clarification.
