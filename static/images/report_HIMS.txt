Hims & Hers Health Inc. (HIMS) has experienced significant growth and outperformed the S&P 500 substantially in recent years. The company's revenue is increasing, and it has shown strong earnings in recent quarters. However, potential investors should be aware of the high volatility (indicated by the MDD and Beta values), and the RSI suggests that the stock might be overbought.
