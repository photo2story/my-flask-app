The lack of recent rating changes information makes it difficult to assess shifts in analyst sentiment.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출      |
|------------|------|-----------|

**Analysis:**

The data shows a somewhat inconsistent pattern.  Revenue generally increased over the past few quarters, but EPS figures have fluctuated. Recent EPS(0.07) is low when compared to previous EPS. This needs to be further investigated for potential margin compression or other factors.

**7. Overall Summary**

Hims & Hers Health Inc. (HIMS) has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but with considerable volatility. Recent price action suggests a potential reversal of a short-term downtrend, supported by oversold indicators (RSI) and a positive last trading session. However, analyst opinions are neutral, and there are some concerns about margin compression and ROE.  The strong revenue growth and high MRI are positive signals, but investors should carefully consider the risks and monitor developments related to profitability, particularly in light of recent changes in EPS and ROE. The negotiation with Novo Nordisk is a key event to watch.  A long-term investment horizon may be appropriate, given the positive expected return, but careful risk management is essential due to the stock's volatility.
