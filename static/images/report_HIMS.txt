2026-01-01 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the HIMS data you provided, following your requested format:

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** HIMS (Hims & Hers Health Inc)
*   **Company Overview:** Hims & Hers Health Inc. is a telehealth company that offers personalized health and wellness solutions.
*   **HIMS Cumulative Return:** 113.31%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 76.17%
*   **Divergence:** 37.1 (Relative Divergence: 30.2)

**Analysis:** HIMS has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, generating a 113.31% cumulative return compared to VOO's 76.17%. The divergence of 37.1% suggests substantial outperformance. The relative divergence of 30.2% indicates that while positive, the current divergence is not near its historical high within the observed range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | 113.0%  | 80.8% | 36.0% | -0.0  | 7.4    |

**Analysis:** The data shows an impressive CAGR of 113.0% over the 2024-2026 period. The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 80.8% indicates high volatility and potential for significant losses during downturns. The Alpha of 36.0% shows that HIMS has outperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) by a considerable margin, indicating strong stock-specific performance. The Beta of -0.0 suggests the stock price has very little correlation with the overall market. It is very unusual for a company to have a beta this low, as almost all companies are affected at least in part by the overall market. Market capitalization is $7.4 billion.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 33.04
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 32.49, Previous Close: 33.04, Change: -1.66
*   **5-day SMA:** 34.18
*   **20-day SMA:** 36.42
*   **60-day SMA:** 42.35

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all its moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a potential downtrend in the short to medium term. The negative change in the last market data further supports this observation. The gap between the shorter-term (5-day) and longer-term (60-day) moving averages suggests that the recent decline is impacting the overall trend.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 14.61 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.30
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (27 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.3% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.4 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 41.6% (Excess return compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.9 suggests a high investment recommendation *according to this indicator*. This is in contrast to many of the other results, so additional research should be done.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 14.61 indicates the stock is heavily oversold, suggesting a potential for a price rebound.
*   **PPO:** -0.30 is relatively neutral in the short-term.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "buy" signal is based on the MRI, but the oversold RSI suggests careful consideration.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence indicates short-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** A 41.6% expected return is attractive, suggesting that the model projects strong future growth relative to the S&P 500 if held long-term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **[2025-12-16] Hims & Hers Health (HIMS): Taking Stock of Valuation After a Sharp 90‑Day Pullback:** Suggests concern about recent stock performance.
*   **[2025-12-29] Hims & Hers stock slides into year-end as investors weigh Ohio buildout and macro calendar:** Ohio buildout is likely a reference to a new facility or expansion which will require a large capital expenditure.
*   **[2025-11-17] Hims & Hers Health, Inc. Announces $250 Million Share Repurchase Program Authorization:** Share buybacks can boost stock price but also indicate management believes the stock is undervalued and is using company funds.
*   **[2025-12-29] Why HIMS Stock Is Up 36% In 2025:** Positive overall for the year, but contradicts the recent pullback.
*   **[2025-12-13] $HIMS stock fell 6% this week. Here's what we see in our data.:** Confirms recent negative performance.
*   **[2025-12-07] Hims & Hers: The Market's Panic Is Irrational (NYSE:HIMS):** Suggests the recent sell-off is an overreaction.

**Analysis:** The news headlines present a mixed picture. While the stock has shown significant gains over the year, recent articles highlight a pullback, suggesting potential concerns about valuation and short-term performance. The share repurchase program and arguments against market panic offer some positive counterpoints. The headlines mentioning the "Ohio buildout and macro calendar" signals there are capital expenditures in the future.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Not available (Mean rating not provided)
*   **Opinions:** 12 analysts
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 44.67 / 85.00 / 25.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not available.

**Analysis:** The wide range in target prices (25 to 85) reveals uncertainty about the stock's future. The average target price of $44.67 suggests a potential upside from the current price, but the lack of consensus rating and recent changes makes it difficult to assess the overall analyst sentiment.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE   |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.58B  | 2.72% |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.56B  | 7.55% |

| 2024-12-31   | $0.48B  | 5.46% |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.44B  | 17.18% |

**Analysis:** Revenue has steadily increased over the quarters, indicating strong sales growth. Profit margins remain high, showing the company's ability to generate profits from its revenue. However, ROE (Return on Equity) has been declining recently, indicating a less efficient use of equity to generate profits.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

HIMS has demonstrated strong historical growth and has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but recent data suggests some short-term headwinds.

*   **Positives:** High CAGR, strong revenue growth, high profit margins, a buyback program and high MRI (potentially). High expectations of future returns.
*   **Negatives:** High volatility (MDD), recent stock price decline, declining ROE, and mixed news sentiment, with recent coverage focusing on a pullback. Discrepancy between high MRI rating, and other indicators.
*   **Key Considerations:** The oversold RSI suggests a potential rebound. The long-term investment horizon suggested by the expected return of 41.6% might be appropriate, but the short-term volatility and recent decline necessitate careful consideration of risk tolerance.
*   **Overall:** HIMS presents a potentially rewarding but risky investment. The company has demonstrated strong growth, but the recent pullback and declining ROE warrant caution. Investors should carefully evaluate their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing. The wide range in analyst target prices highlights the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future. Look out for news on the Ohio buildout and its implications for the company's bottom line.
