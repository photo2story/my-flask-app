- **Analyst Opinions:** Analyst opinions on IBM are mixed, with some analysts issuing "buy" ratings and others issuing "hold" or "sell" ratings. The average price target for IBM is $170, which suggests potential downside risk.
- **Performance Highlights:** IBM has been making progress in its transition to a cloud-centric business, but it faces stiff competition from established cloud providers.
