* **S&P 500 (VOO) Accumulated Return:** 89.66%
* **Difference:** 154.18%
* **Relative Divergence:** 63.68%

BX has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the historical period. Its relative divergence of 63.68% indicates that BX's performance has been higher than the S&P 500 for a majority of the time.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** 135.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 130.85

* **PPO:** 0.47
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 4.92 (Positive, short-term uptrend)
* **Expected Return:** 88.68% (Maximum 5-year expected return)

The RSI is in the overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback. The positive PPO and relative divergence signal a strong short-term trend, but the high RSI indicates a potential overbought situation. The expected return of 88.68% is promising, but it should be considered alongside the potential short-term pullback.

Investors should monitor market conditions and the company's performance closely to make informed investment decisions.
