**Analysis:**

XRP-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period. However, the relative divergence of 57.4 suggests the outperformance is not as extreme as it has been historically.  The Alpha/Beta analysis shows very high volatility, with periods of large negative alpha followed by periods of large positive alpha. The Beta is low, indicating that XRP-USD is not strongly correlated with the S&P 500.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values indicate substantial risk. CAGR 수치를 보면 변동성이 매우 심해서 투자에 유의해야 함.

The recent price action shows a positive change of 3.54% in the last market. The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, and the current price is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which might be interpreted as a short-term bearish signal.  However, the recent price increase could indicate a potential reversal.

*   **Expected Return:** 133.7% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

The MRI indicates low market risk, which is a positive sign. The RSI of 39.83 is nearing the oversold threshold, which could signal a potential buying opportunity. The negative PPO suggests a short-term bearish trend. The hybrid signal suggests a cautious approach, recommending selling a small portion of holdings. The negative change in relative divergence reinforces the short-term bearish outlook. However, the high expected return (133.7%) suggests that long-term investors might see significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**5. 종합 Summary**

XRP-USD has historically delivered very high returns compared to the S&P 500, but also carries significant risk, as demonstrated by its high volatility and MDD figures. Recent price action shows a bounce, but short-term technical indicators are somewhat bearish. The MRI indicates low overall market risk, while the RSI is nearing oversold territory. The news about Bitcoin's rally could be a positive catalyst. The hybrid signal indicates a cautious stance. While the expected return is very high, the lack of analyst consensus and high risk profile suggest that XRP-USD is a speculative investment suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance and long-term investment horizon.
