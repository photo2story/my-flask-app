    *   The **negative change in relative divergence** indicates a recent underperformance compared to the benchmark.
    *   The **Expected Return of 109.3%** is a projection of long-term outperformance versus the S&P 500, assuming a buy-and-hold strategy. However, this should be viewed cautiously given the current risk indicators.
