## XRP-USD Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

XRP-USD, representing Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency, shows significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  However, this is accompanied by high volatility and substantial maximum drawdown (MDD). Recent price action indicates a downtrend, supported by low RSI and negative PPO values.  The high relative divergence suggests potential for a reversal, but risk remains elevated.

The high beta values (especially in 2018-2020, 2021-2023 and 2022-2024) indicate significant sensitivity to market movements.  While alpha is positive in recent years, it's crucial to note the substantial negative CAGR and MDD in earlier periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 1.8977
* **Last Market Price:** 1.8503 (a -2.46% change from the previous close of 1.8970. This represents a small, but noticeable price drop.)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 2.0302
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 2.2319
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 2.3621

The price is below all three moving averages, confirming the downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Risk Assessment:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 19.20 (Oversold; signals potential for a price increase, but not guaranteed)
* **PPO:** -1.35 (Negative; suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.6 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 103.4% (Long-term expected return exceeding the S&P 500 by a significant margin.)

The combination of oversold RSI, negative PPO, and high MRI suggests a high-risk scenario. While the high expected return is appealing, the significant volatility and recent price drop warrant caution.  The large negative change in the last market price (-2.46%) suggests a recent sharp downward movement. The potential for a price increase is present due to the low RSI, but the negative PPO and high MRI indicate a high level of risk.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy with careful risk management is advised.
