The substantial historical outperformance, if sustained, would justify a higher risk portfolio allocation. Consider the news headlines, indicating that technical analysis might be showing 'doubts', while 'ETF buzz' is in the headlines.

It is essential to understand that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile.
