## XRP-USD Investment Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

XRP-USD, a cryptocurrency representing Ripple's native token, demonstrates significant performance divergence from the S&P 500 (VOO). While exhibiting high volatility and considerable risk, its long-term potential, based on projected excess returns, warrants consideration for long-term investors.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

XRP-USD is a cryptocurrency developed by Ripple Labs for facilitating international payments.  The cumulative return of XRP-USD (461.41%) massively outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (38.05%). The current divergence (423.4) places XRP-USD in the upper percentile of its historical range (relative divergence of 48.6%).  However, this high return is accompanied by substantial volatility, as evidenced by the high maximum drawdown (MDD) values and the fluctuating Alpha and Beta coefficients across the provided years.  The Beta coefficient, representing the volatility relative to the market, is considerably high and inconsistent.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD  | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) | Notes                                    |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 2.0238
* **Last Market Price:** 2.1448 (down 0.65 from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** 1.9469
* **20-day Moving Average:** 2.1372
* **60-day Moving Average:** 2.332

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend.  The recent closing price represents a slight dip.

**3. Technical Indicators and Risk Assessment:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4715 (High Risk) indicating a potential high level of volatility and risk.
* **RSI:** 42.14 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum but not oversold.)
* **PPO:** -0.41 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -1.7 (Short-term bearish movement.)
* **Expected Return:** 103.9%  This implies a substantial potential excess return over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). However, this high expected return should be considered alongside the high-risk profile outlined above. The significant negative change (-0.65) in the last market price does not indicate a sudden drastic movement (neither 급반등 nor 급하락) but still warrants caution.


**Conclusion:**

XRP-USD presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.  The historical data reveals significant volatility and periods of substantial losses.  The high expected return relative to the S&P 500 is appealing for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance.  However, rigorous risk management and diversification are crucial.  Further research into the regulatory landscape surrounding XRP and Ripple is strongly recommended before making any investment decision.
