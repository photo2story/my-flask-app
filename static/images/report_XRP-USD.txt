## XRP-USD Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

XRP-USD, often referred to as Ripple, is a cryptocurrency and payment network.  The provided data shows a significantly higher cumulative return for XRP-USD compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), although this performance has been highly volatile.  Recent price movements suggest a slightly bullish trend, but the market risk is moderate.  Long-term potential exists but involves substantial risk.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (XRP-USD):** 427.20%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 82.37%
* **Return Difference:** 344.8%  (This signifies that XRP-USD outperformed VOO by a substantial margin over the period considered. However, note that this is a single point in time and past performance is not indicative of future results).
* **Relative Divergence:** 43.0% (This indicates XRP-USD's performance is positioned relatively high compared to its historical performance range against VOO.  It doesn't directly translate to future outperformance).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals highly volatile performance across different periods.  While some periods show strong positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others show significant negative alpha and high betas, indicating high sensitivity to market fluctuations. The large swings in CAGR highlight the extreme risk associated with XRP-USD.  Capitalization shows significant fluctuation, potentially reflecting market sentiment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 2.379
* **Last Market Price:** 2.401
* **5-day Moving Average:** 2.398
* **20-day Moving Average:** 2.372
* **60-day Moving Average:** 2.565

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. However, it sits below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term bearish trend.  The recent increase (Last Market Price vs. Previous Close) shows a minor price jump of 1.32%, too small to be considered a rapid surge.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Moderate Risk)
* **RSI:** 49.91 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.13 (Positive; suggests a bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -3.3% (This suggests a negative expected return at the current moment.)
* **Long-Term Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** The provided data does not offer a basis for predicting long-term excess returns against the S&P 500. While XRP-USD has shown significant gains in the past, the high volatility and lack of consistent positive alpha make predicting long-term outperformance highly speculative and risky.  Any long-term investment should be done with a very high risk tolerance.


**Conclusion:**

XRP-USD has demonstrated significant past outperformance relative to the S&P 500, however, it's extremely volatile and carries substantial risk.  The current technical indicators suggest a slightly bullish short-term trend, but the long-term outlook is highly uncertain.  Investment decisions should be based on a thorough understanding of the cryptocurrency market and a high tolerance for risk.  The -3.3% expected return highlights that caution is warranted, and long-term investment decisions must account for the possibility of significant losses.
