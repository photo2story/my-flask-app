*   **Current Price:** 2.5561084747314453
*   **Last Market Data:** `{'price': 2.5565596, 'previousClose': 2.5863311, 'change': -1.15}` (A slight decrease of -1.15 from the previous close).
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 2.5052
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 2.2871
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 2.2123

*   **Analysis:** The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The price decrease in the last market data, while relatively small, shows recent volatility.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.0 (Indicates very Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 71.39223575893581 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a pullback.)
*   **PPO:** 1.6962 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (단기하락) - Short-term decrease in relative divergence, suggesting some recent underperformance.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0 (No predicted excess return over the S&P 500 based on the model.)

*   **Analysis:** The RSI suggests the asset may be overbought in the short term. The negative change in relative divergence indicates recent underperformance. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) is showing low risk, but keep in mind the specific scale used (0.45-0.35 is low, etc.). The fact that the last market data showed a slight price decrease is also a short term concern.
