## XRP-USD Investment Report

**1. Performance Analysis & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

XRP-USD, a cryptocurrency representing Ripple's network, has shown significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The cumulative return for XRP-USD is 428.70%, while VOO's is 98.07%. This results in a substantial difference of 330.6 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 37.2% indicates that XRP-USD's performance is currently positioned towards the higher end of its historical performance range relative to VOO. However, it's crucial to note the high volatility indicated by the CAGR and MDD figures (see section 4).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $2.153
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $2.246
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $2.359
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $1.560

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The significant gap between the current price and the 20 and 60 day moving averages indicates a recent price decline.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 40.39 – This suggests the asset is approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so.  It could signal a potential bounce, but not necessarily a sustained uptrend.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -3.47 –  A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -3.9 – This indicates a recent short-term decline in relative performance against the benchmark.

* **Expected Return:** 3.3% – This represents an anticipated long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500, assuming consistent periodic investment.  This figure should be considered cautiously given the inherent volatility of XRP-USD.  A price of $2.15 does not trigger any specific alarm regarding sudden price movements, but given the context of the other indicators, this may be a continuation of a downward trend.


**4.  Historical Performance (CAGR, MDD, Alpha, Beta):**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -70.0%   | 45.9%    | -86.0%   | -0.0  | 11.0   |
| 2018-2020  | -339.0%  | 66.5%    | -366.0%  | -0.0  | 13.0   |
| 2019-2021  | 162.0%   | 66.5%    | 91.0%    | -0.0  | 48.0   |
| 2020-2022  | 25.0%    | 66.5%    | 16.0%    | -0.0  | 20.0   |
| 2021-2023  | 70.0%    | 43.2%    | 46.0%    | -0.0  | 36.0   |
| 2022-2024  | 356.0%   | 30.2%    | 318.0%   | -0.0  | 124.0  |

The data highlights significant volatility and periods of substantial losses.  The negative alpha values consistently indicate underperformance relative to a risk-adjusted benchmark, although this likely reflects the use of an inappropriate benchmark for a cryptocurrency like XRP. The beta is close to 0, as expected for an asset which generally does not correlate strongly with the overall market.  Note that the market capitalization fluctuates significantly.

**7. Overall Analysis:**
