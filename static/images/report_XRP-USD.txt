| 2021-2023                  | 210.0%  | 80.5%  | 209.0%  | 0.0  | 37.1  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR is highly variable, ranging from significantly negative to very positive, indicating high periods of both loss and gain. Recent periods (2022-2025) show very high growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  MDD is consistently high, indicating significant risk.  Investors need to be prepared for substantial potential losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally high (either positive or negative), suggesting XRP's performance is often independent of the broader market.  A high positive alpha indicates outperformance compared to its risk-adjusted benchmark. A high negative alpha indicates underperformance compared to its risk-adjusted benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta is low and usually near zero, suggesting XRP's price is not strongly correlated with the S&P 500.  This can be both a benefit (in a down market) and a drawback (in a strong bull market).  The 2023-2025 period has a higher beta, suggesting a slightly increased correlation.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close Price:** 2.1605
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 2.1507
    *   Previous Close: 2.1552
    *   Change: -0.21%
*   **5-day SMA:** 2.1518
*   **20-day SMA:** 2.1499
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.3953

*   **Analysis:** The recent price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a possible short-term downward trend. The 60-day SMA is significantly higher, suggesting that longer-term trends have been more positive, but the short-term trend is weakening. The small negative change in the last market indicates a recent dip.

**3. Indicators Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 52.66 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.66 (Potentially bullish if trending upward)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (489 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.3 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 816.1% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** The high MRI suggests the model considers XRP relatively safe. However, this contradicts the high MDD figures. This is a significant point of conflict and suggests caution should be applied to the MRI.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI value suggests a neutral momentum. It's neither overbought nor oversold.
    *   **PPO:** The PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which is generally considered bullish.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying, further indicating a positive outlook based on the model's calculations.
    *   **Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence indicates a short-term downward trend.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return suggests significant potential upside but should be viewed with considerable skepticism. It's crucial to remember past performance is not indicative of future results, especially with highly volatile assets.

    *   Lack of correlation with the broader market (low Beta) can be a disadvantage in bull markets.
*   **Key Considerations:**

    *   **Risk Tolerance:** Investors should only consider XRP if they have a very high-risk tolerance and can withstand substantial potential losses.
    *   **Due Diligence:**  Thorough research is essential.  Understand the technology behind XRP, its use cases, and the regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies. Stay informed about any developments related to the Ripple lawsuit with the SEC, and the potential development and listing of Ripple ETFs.
    *   **Model Conflicts:**  The conflicting signals between the MRI and MDD suggest caution.  Don't rely solely on model-driven recommendations without independent analysis.

**In conclusion, based on this data, XRP is a speculative investment. The potential for high returns exists, but so does the risk of significant losses. A well-informed and risk-tolerant investor might consider a small allocation to XRP as part of a diversified portfolio, but only after conducting thorough due diligence.**
