| 2020-2022  | 25.0%    | 66.5%  | -0.0  | 20.0  |        |

| 2022-2024  | 382.0%   | 30.2%  | -0.0  | 132.0 |        |

The high volatility and inconsistent performance are evident, highlighted by the substantial maximum drawdown (MDD) values.  The near-zero alpha suggests it doesn't consistently outperform the market adjusted for risk (Beta).  The fluctuating Beta shows a changing correlation with the market.  Cap(B) likely represents market capitalization in billions, indicating significant growth in recent years.

The significant negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises concerns about long-term investment performance.  A potential investor should carefully weigh the high risk and volatility against the potential for high reward, considering the uncertain regulatory environment and market sentiment.  Due diligence and diversification are crucial.
