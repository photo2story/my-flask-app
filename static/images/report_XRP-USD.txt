**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

XRP-USD is a cryptocurrency, representing XRP tokens on the Ripple network.  Its performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500 (represented by VOO) over the analyzed period. The cumulative return of 638.77% is drastically higher than the VOO's 97.29%, resulting in a substantial 541.48% difference.  The high relative divergence (56.4%) shows this outperformance is substantial compared to its historical volatility. However, this high volatility is reflected in the significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) observed in the provided CAGR data.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile alpha and beta values.  While recent years (2022-2025) show a high positive alpha, indicating significant outperformance compared to the market, previous periods show substantial negative alphas and high betas, suggesting high market sensitivity.  The large swings in CAGR and MDD highlight the extremely risky nature of investing in XRP-USD.

| 2020-2022  | 25.0%    | 66.5%    | 16.0%   | 0.0     | 19.9    |
| 2021-2023  | 70.0%    | 43.2%    | 46.0%   | 0.2     | 36.0    |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of XRP-USD is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent minor downturn.  However, it's significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term uptrend. The recent price drop (-2.98%) reflects the negative change compared to the previous close.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (35.73):**  Indicates the asset is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible.
* **PPO (-1.33):** Shows negative momentum, confirming the short-term bearish trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-1.2%):**  Confirms a recent downward trend.  The negative change in the price (Last-market data) reinforces this observation.  There isn't a significant *sharp* drop to warrant a label like "급하락" (sharp decline).


The expected return of 0% against the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment is based on the assumption that XRP-USD’s extreme volatility will continue.  While past performance does not guarantee future results, the significant historical outperformance and current indicators suggest a potential for continued high volatility and either significant gains or losses.  This requires a high-risk tolerance and is not suitable for risk-averse investors.  It's important to note that this analysis is limited by the provided data.  A more comprehensive analysis would require additional factors.
