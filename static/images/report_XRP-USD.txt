**Conclusion:**

XRP-USD has shown exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with extremely high risk and volatility.  The negative recent price change and the below-average moving averages suggest a potential short-term downturn, though the positive PPO hints at continued bullish momentum. The high expected return should be treated cautiously due to the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. Long-term investment should be approached with a high risk tolerance and a thorough understanding of the cryptocurrency market.  The stated 100.3% expected return over the long-term needs more detailed justification and should be considered a high-risk, high-reward scenario.
