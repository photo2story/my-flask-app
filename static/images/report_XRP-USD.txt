*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown consistently high, often near or at 100%, suggesting significant risk of capital loss during the analyzed periods.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are predominantly positive, especially in recent years (e.g., 1516.0% in 2023-2025), indicating that XRP-USD has outperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis during those periods. However, negative Alpha values in earlier periods (e.g., -212.0% in 2018-2020) highlight periods of underperformance.

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests medium risk. RSI is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions. PPO is slightly negative.

**5. Summary and Conclusion:**

XRP-USD has delivered exceptional historical returns compared to the S&P 500. However, it exhibits high volatility and significant risk, as evidenced by the wide relative spread, high Maximum Drawdown, and the bearish Hybrid Signal.

While the expected return is very attractive, the technical indicators and risk assessment suggest caution. The recent price increase of 2.78% could signal a shift, but further confirmation is needed.

**Recommendation:**

Given the high risk and volatility, and the bearish hybrid signal, a cautious approach is warranted. The 84% Cash suggests moving into cash for safety, while the 20.4% selloff of holdings suggests risk reduction.
