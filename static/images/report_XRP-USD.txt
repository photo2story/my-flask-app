## XRP-USD Performance Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

XRP-USD, a cryptocurrency representing Ripple's network, has shown significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  However, this high return is accompanied by high volatility and significant drawdowns.  Recent price action shows a downward trend.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

XRP-USD boasts a cumulative return of 483.62% compared to the S&P 500's 97.43%  (as of the last data point). This represents a substantial outperformance.  However, this is highly volatile and potentially unsustainable in the long term, as demonstrated by the considerable variation in its Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) across different periods.  The alpha and beta coefficients highlight its high volatility and inconsistent correlation with the broader market.  Specifically:

* **High Volatility:** The large swings in CAGR and MDD reveal XRP-USD's extreme price volatility.
* **Inconsistent Beta:**  The beta fluctuates dramatically, indicating a changing relationship with the market.  Periods of high positive beta suggest strong market correlation, while negative betas imply an inverse relationship.
* **Positive Alpha (Recent):**  The positive alpha in recent periods (2022-2025) suggests potential outperformance relative to the market during these specific timeframes. However, this is offset by negative alpha in the majority of other intervals.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -70.0%   | 45.9%  | -0.1  | 11.1  |        |

| 2019-2021  | 162.0%   | 66.5%  | -0.1  | 47.9  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 25.0%    | 66.5%  | 0.0   | 19.9  |        |

| 2023-2025  | 475.0%   | 26.3%  | 2.2   | 139.5 |        |


The provided relative divergence (42.2%) shows that XRP-USD's performance currently sits above 42.2% of the historical spread between its performance and that of the S&P 500.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price action shows a downward trend.

* **Closing Price:** 2.4227
* **Last Market Price:** 2.4158
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 2.3929
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 2.7964
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 2.5876

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (25.28):**  Suggests the asset is currently in oversold territory.  However, in highly volatile assets like XRP-USD, RSI may not be a reliable indicator.
* **PPO (-2.74):** A negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence (-6.4%):**  Shows a recent decrease in the relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (-0.5%):**  The negative expected return reflects the current bearish market sentiment.  This is a short-term prediction, and long-term projections are highly uncertain.

The slight price decrease in the `Last-market` data (-0.28%) reflects a small downward movement, not a dramatic drop.


**Conclusion:**

While XRP-USD has historically outperformed the S&P 500, its extreme volatility makes it a high-risk investment.  The current indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy with regular contributions could potentially benefit from the high-growth potential, but this carries substantial risk, as demonstrated by the past periods of significant losses.  Consider this analysis carefully alongside your personal risk tolerance and investment goals.  The extreme volatility and lack of consistent historical correlation with the market necessitates detailed due diligence before making investment decisions in this asset.
