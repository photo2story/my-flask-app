**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

XRP-USD represents the Ripple cryptocurrency.  Its performance has vastly outpaced the S&P 500, showing a cumulative return significantly higher. However, the relative divergence suggests this outperformance is not unprecedented within the historical context.  The provided alpha and beta analysis shows highly volatile returns, with periods of both extreme positive and negative returns.  Noteworthy is the substantial negative CAGR for 2018-2020. The high beta values in some years demonstrate substantial sensitivity to overall market movements. The recent years, however, show impressively high positive CAGRs.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B)  |
|------------|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 2017-2019  | -45.0%   | 68.4%   | -60.0%  | 0.0     | 10.8    |
| 2018-2020  | -301.0%  | 68.4%   | -331.0% | -0.0    | 12.3    |
| 2019-2021  | 215.0%   | 77.1%   | 141.0%  | -0.0    | 46.6    |
| 2020-2022  | 77.0%    | 77.1%   | 56.0%   | 0.0     | 19.4    |
| 2021-2023  | 126.0%   | 77.1%   | 98.0%   | 1.1     | 35.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 486.0%   | 76.4%   | 470.0%  | 0.6     | 116.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 291.0%   | 75.4%   | 288.0%  | 0.5     | 119.5   |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $2.13
* **Last Market Price:** $2.05 (Down 4.36% from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $2.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $2.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $2.38

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The recent price drop of -4.36% is noteworthy and reflects a possible immediate downward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (32.63):** Indicates the asset is currently oversold, potentially suggesting a bounce is due, however this should be interpreted with caution considering the high volatility of XRP.
* **PPO (-1.01):**  Confirms bearish momentum, aligning with the price action and moving averages.
* **Relative Divergence Change (-0.3):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength versus the S&P 500.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI) (0.475):** High risk.
* **Expected Return (91.0%):** This suggests a significant potential for outperformance over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500.  However, this projection should be viewed with considerable caution given the inherent volatility of XRP and the uncertainty of long-term cryptocurrency markets.  The high risk indicated by the MRI should be carefully considered.


**Conclusion:**

XRP-USD shows a history of substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500, though with extreme volatility. Current indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend, although the oversold RSI might signal a potential near-term rebound. The high expected return is promising for long-term investors, but the high risk profile and extreme volatility necessitate a cautious approach, potentially involving diversification and risk management strategies.  The substantial negative CAGRs in some years highlight the potential for significant losses.  Thorough due diligence and risk tolerance assessment are crucial before investing in XRP-USD.
