## XRP-USD Performance Analysis

**0. Summary Statistics:**

XRP-USD, a cryptocurrency representing Ripple's network, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over an unspecified period, achieving a cumulative return of 460.53% compared to VOO's 98.02%.  However, this performance is highly volatile, as indicated by the wide range of CAGR and significant maximum drawdowns (MDD) observed in the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **XRP-USD Cumulative Return:** 460.53%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 98.02%
* **Return Difference:** 362.5%
* **Relative Divergence:** 40.1% (This indicates XRP-USD's performance is in the 40.1st percentile of its historical relative performance against VOO, considering the historical maximum and minimum differences).

The provided Alpha and Beta values show a highly volatile and often negatively correlated relationship with the market (S&P 500) over various periods. This highlights XRP-USD's significant risk compared to the relative stability of VOO.  The high positive alpha in recent years (2023-2025), however, demonstrates potential outperformance in specific periods.  Note that the meaning of "Cap(B)" is not provided, preventing a complete interpretation.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The table shows highly variable performance, with periods of extreme negative returns (-339%) alongside periods of substantial positive returns (452%). The beta values fluctuate, suggesting that the correlation with the broader market is not consistent. The high alpha in 2023-2025 is notable, implying potential outperformance relative to the market during that specific timeframe.  It is essential to note the limitations of relying on past performance to predict future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Price:** $2.33 (approximately; based on `previousClose`)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $2.51
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $2.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $2.58

The current price ($2.33) is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase indicated by `Last-market` (5.66% increase) needs further context regarding the timeframe of this increase to properly understand its significance.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (18.48):** This indicates the asset is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.  However, given the high volatility, it's not a definitive buy signal.

* **PPO (-3.98):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum. This aligns with the observation that the current price is below the moving averages.

* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence (-18.2):** This shows a recent weakening of the relative performance against the benchmark, indicating a short-term downward trend.

* **Expected Return (-0.4%):** The negative expected return suggests that, given the current market conditions, holding XRP-USD might generate a negative return relative to the investment in the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This reflects the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments.

**Conclusion:**

XRP-USD exhibits a volatile history with periods of extreme outperformance against the S&P 500 but also significant periods of underperformance. The currently oversold RSI and recent price drop suggest potential for a bounce, but the negative PPO and expected return, coupled with its high volatility, indicate significant risk.  A long-term investment requires careful consideration of this high risk and the potential for substantial drawdowns. Further analysis including volume and broader market conditions is recommended before any investment decisions are made.  The provided data's time frame is crucial for a comprehensive interpretation; without it, the analysis remains limited.
