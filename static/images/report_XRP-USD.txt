2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of XRP-USD (Ripple) based on the provided data.

**0. Report Summary**

XRP has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in cumulative return, but exhibits high volatility and a recent downward trend.  The Market Risk Indicator suggests medium investment risk. Analyst opinions are mixed, and recent news highlights both positive developments and continued price struggles.

**1. Return Rate Comparison (XRP-USD vs. VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Ripple is a technology company that developed the XRP Ledger, a blockchain network for facilitating faster and cheaper global payments.
*   **XRP Cumulative Return:** 680.12%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 78.07%
*   **Divergence:** 602.1
*   **Relative Divergence:** 31.5

**Analysis:**

XRP has drastically outperformed the S&P 500 in cumulative return over the tracked period. However, a relative divergence of 31.5 indicates that the current performance difference is in the lower end of its historical range. This suggests that while the overall return is high, recent performance relative to its own history might be weaker.

| 2019-2021  | 625.0%  | 89.9% | 579.0% | 0.1  | 50.4   |
| 2020-2022  | 266.0%  | 89.9% | 266.0% | 0.0  | 20.6   |

| 2023-2025  | 384.0%  | 78.8% | 320.0% | 0.2  | 109.8  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR fluctuates wildly, showing extreme gains and losses in different periods. This underlines XRP's high volatility.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** MDD consistently high, indicating substantial potential losses for investors.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally positive except for the initial periods. Alpha significantly exceeds the S&P 500 returns in many periods, indicating that it is generating returns above what would be expected based on market movements alone.
*   **Beta:** Beta is very low (close to zero). This suggests that XRP's price movements are not strongly correlated with the S&P 500 and overall market risk has little effect on the rate of return.
*   **Cap(B):**  The values show the market capitalization, and it fluctuates significantly in each period.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 1.8109
*   **Last-market:** price: 1.8159, previousClose: 1.8619, change: -2.47%
*   **5-day SMA:** 1.9064
*   **20-day SMA:** 2.0391
*   **60-day SMA:** 2.2325

**Analysis:**

The current price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is the lowest, further confirming the recent downward pressure. The negative change from the previous close reinforces this bearish signal.

**3. RSI, PPO Index Indicators and Divergence:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 24.42 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.7549
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (489 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.4 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 1202.0%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests medium investment risk.
*   The RSI indicates that XRP is currently oversold, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity.  However, oversold conditions can persist for extended periods.
*   The negative PPO reinforces the downward momentum indicated by the SMAs.
*   The recommendation to buy 100% suggests the algorithm is considering a potential upward swing with very safe value.
*   The large expected return is interesting, but should be treated with caution. This number is highly speculative and depends on many factors.
