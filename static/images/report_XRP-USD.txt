* **RSI:** 66.21 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.526 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.2 (Short-term bearish divergence)

**Conclusion:**

XRP-USD has demonstrated exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500. However, this performance comes with very high volatility and risk. The high beta, significant drawdowns, and inconsistent alpha across different time periods highlight the speculative nature of this investment.  The relatively high RSI and the negative divergence suggest caution; the market may be experiencing short-term selling pressure.  The extremely high projected long-term expected return should be viewed with skepticism unless a detailed justification of this projection is provided.  Further investigation is needed to fully understand the underlying drivers of these returns and risks before making investment decisions. The provided expected return needs careful scrutiny and should not be interpreted as a guaranteed outcome.
