The Alpha values consistently show significant outperformance (or underperformance in earlier years) compared to the benchmark (positive values indicate outperformance, negative values indicate underperformance). Beta is relatively low, suggesting that XRP-USD doesn't correlate strongly with the overall market represented by VOO.  However, the high volatility (MDD) indicates substantial risk.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 2.2045
* **Last Market Price:** 2.1857
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 2.16
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 2.0695
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 2.2244

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend, but below the 60-day average, indicating a potential pullback to the mean could occur.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3909 (Medium Risk) - This suggests a relatively moderate risk level.
* **RSI:** 74.41 -  Indicates the asset is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction may be imminent.
* **PPO:** 1.3542 - A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.8 - Shows short-term upward momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** Not provided in the data.
* **Expected Return:** 92.2% - This high expected return, over a long-term (2+ years) horizon relative to VOO, needs careful consideration in the light of the high volatility evident in the historical data.  The high expected return is likely partially driven by the substantial alpha values that XRP displayed in certain years.  Significant volatility warrants caution.

**Important Note:** The 'change' value in 'Last-market' is small (0.13), thus there is no significant indication of a sudden price jump or drop. The high expected return should be viewed with caution given the high risk associated with cryptocurrency investments.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.
