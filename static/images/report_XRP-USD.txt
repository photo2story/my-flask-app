The highly volatile nature of XRP-USD is evident in the large swings in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  The negative Alphas in several periods suggest underperformance relative to the market benchmark, while the positive Alphas in later periods, especially 2023-2025, highlight periods of significant outperformance.  The Beta values show a varying relationship with the market, sometimes exhibiting low correlation or even inverse correlation and sometimes displaying a high degree of market sensitivity (2.2 in 2023-2025 suggesting high volatility and risk).


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 2.145595

The price has experienced a recent decline, as indicated by the closing price being below the 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages. The substantial drop from the previous close (-14.43%) highlights a significant downward price movement.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 23.29 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -1.88 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -9.1% (Indicates a recent downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -1.1% (This is likely a short-term expectation; long-term projections are highly uncertain and depend significantly on the future regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and the overall market conditions).


**Conclusion:**

XRP-USD has demonstrated periods of substantial outperformance against the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by extremely high volatility and risk. Recent price action shows a significant drop.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and recent relative divergence indicate bearish momentum. The high volatility and significant regulatory uncertainty make predicting long-term returns extremely challenging. A long-term investment strategy should carefully consider the substantial risk associated with this asset.  The -1.1% expected return should be interpreted cautiously and is not a reliable prediction, especially in light of the high variability demonstrated by the historical data.
