*   **60-day Moving Average:** 2.7773

**Analysis:**

The price has risen 1.28% compared to the previous close. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the current price is below the 60-day moving average, which could indicate some resistance at that level.

*   **RSI:** 64.23 (Approaching overbought territory, but not yet extreme)

*   **Expected Return:** 609.1% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

The MRI of 0.9 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation. The RSI indicates increasing buying momentum. The positive PPO supports the idea of a short-term upward trend.  The hybrid signal is a strong buy signal, reinforcing the positive outlook. The large expected return suggests significant long-term outperformance potential compared to the S&P 500. The recent price change of 1.28% also suggests positive momentum, so special issues should be checked.
