## XRP-USD Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

XRP-USD, the cryptocurrency Ripple, exhibited significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods. However,  recent price action suggests a potential slowdown, indicated by moving averages and relative strength indicators.  While long-term expected returns are high,  volatility remains a key concern.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

XRP-USD is a cryptocurrency issued by Ripple Labs.  Its cumulative return of 487.97% drastically outperforms VOO's 52.13% return. The difference is substantial (435.8 points), placing it at the 50.3rd percentile of historical deviations relative to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals highly volatile performance across different periods.  While recent years (2022-2025) show positive alpha (0.4-0.6) suggesting outperformance relative to the market, earlier periods (2017-2020) saw significant negative returns and negative or near-zero alpha. Beta values fluctuate widely, highlighting XRP-USD's high sensitivity to market movements, especially during periods of market downturn (MDD values show frequent large drawdowns).  The high beta underscores its riskier nature compared to the relatively stable S&P 500.  The vastly increased market capitalization (Cap(B)) over time suggests a growing interest in the cryptocurrency.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -44.0%  | 64.6%  | -0.0  | 11.2  |        |
| 2018-2020  | -301.0% | 66.5%  | 0.0   | 12.8  |        |
| 2019-2021  | 215.0%  | 77.1%  | -0.0  | 48.4  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 70.0%   | 77.1%  | -0.0  | 20.1  |        |
| 2021-2023  | 172.0%  | 77.1%  | 0.6   | 36.3  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 614.0%  | 75.4%  | 0.5   | 121.1 |        |
| 2023-2025  | 416.0%  | 75.4%  | 0.4   | 128.6 |        |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is $2.21.  The short-term price action suggests some weakening momentum:

* **5-day MA:** $2.23 (slightly above current price)
* **20-day MA:** $2.16 (below current price)
* **60-day MA:** $2.21 (essentially equal to current price)

The 5-day moving average being higher than the 20-day and 60-day moving averages hints at a recent price decrease, but the 60-day MA indicates relative stability around the current price.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk) suggesting relatively moderate risk.
* **RSI:** 66.21 (above 70 would generally be considered overbought; still in the neutral to slightly overbought zone.)
* **PPO:** 0.526 (positive value indicates bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence:** -0.2 (Short-term downward trend)  This aligns with the moving average analysis suggesting a potential short-term price correction.
* **Expected Return:** 96.5% (over 2 years).  This significantly high projected return compared to the S&P 500 highlights the potential for substantial gains but also the substantial risk given the high volatility demonstrated in the historical data.  This figure should be interpreted with caution given the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments.


**Conclusion:**

XRP-USD has shown impressive long-term returns exceeding the S&P 500, but this has come with considerable volatility.  The current indicators point to a potential short-term correction, but the long-term expected return remains compelling. Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with this asset before making any investment decisions.  Diversification within a broader portfolio is crucial to mitigate the potential losses associated with such a volatile asset.
