## XRP-USD Investment Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

XRP-USD, often referred to as Ripple, is a cryptocurrency and payment network.  The provided data shows significantly higher cumulative returns for XRP-USD than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, but with considerable volatility.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **XRP-USD Cumulative Return:** 468.55%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 86.01%
* **Return Difference:** 382.54%  This indicates XRP-USD has significantly outperformed VOO.  The relative divergence of 41.9% shows that while it's outperformed, it sits at the 41.9th percentile of the historical relative divergence range (between -77.2% and 1020.4%).  This highlights the volatility and risk associated with XRP-USD.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The table shows highly volatile Alpha and Beta values.  High Beta values (above 1) indicate higher volatility than the market, while negative Alphas suggest underperformance compared to the benchmark after adjusting for risk.  However, recent years show improving Alpha, indicating potential outperformance.  Note that the considerable variation in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) throughout the years highlight the high risk.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B)  |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 2.38
* **Last Market Price:** 2.33
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 2.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 2.48
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 2.67

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (45.93):**  Slightly below the neutral level of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions, but leaning towards bearish.
* **PPO (0.70):** A positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (5.4+):** Shows a recent short-term upward movement in relative divergence.  This indicates that the price of XRP-USD has been moving upward, possibly diverging from the broader market trends.

**Change Analysis:** The provided `Last-market` data shows a small positive change (`change`: 0.059),  indicating a minor price increase, not a significant rapid movement.

**Expected Return (-0.9%):** The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) suggests a lower expected return than a simple investment in the S&P 500, given the data provided.  This is despite the historical high returns of XRP-USD.  This underscores the significant risk of investing in XRP-USD.


**Conclusion:**

XRP-USD has demonstrated exceptional past performance compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial volatility and risk, as evidenced by the high Beta, significant drawdowns, and fluctuating alpha values. Current price action suggests a potential downward trend, although short term momentum might be positive. The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 highlights the need for caution.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in XRP-USD.  The data does not reflect future performance, which is inherently uncertain, especially for cryptocurrencies.
