*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current Divergence:** 651.3
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 33.9  (This indicates the current divergence is relatively low compared to its historical range.)

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis & CAGR, MDD:**
    *   The table highlights varying performance across different periods.  Notably, 2019-2021 and 2022-2024 show substantial CAGR values, indicating periods of strong growth.  MDD values are high throughout, indicating significant downside risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Fluctuates significantly.  Positive Alpha suggests outperformance compared to the market, while negative Alpha suggests underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Consistently low (0.0 to 0.2), suggesting XRP's price movements are relatively independent of the overall market (S&P 500).
    *   **Cap(B):** Represents the Sharpe ratio as a proxy, indicating a higher risk-adjusted return. Periods 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 show highest Cap(B), implying better risk-adjusted returns during those times.

    *   The 5-day SMA (2.0013) is below the 20-day SMA (2.2244), which is below the 60-day SMA (2.5091). This indicates a recent downtrend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended). This suggests that based on the model, the current risk level is moderate.
*   **RSI:** 39.73. This indicates that XRP is nearing an oversold condition (typically below 30), which *could* suggest a potential buying opportunity (but should not be the sole basis for investment decisions).

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:**  -5.4 (-):  Short-term decrease. This supports the observed downtrend.
*   **Expected Return:** 1021.3%. This is a *very high* projected return, suggesting the model anticipates significant future growth (but is unlikely to be realistic).
