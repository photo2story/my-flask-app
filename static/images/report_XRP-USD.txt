## XRP-USD Stock Analysis Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

XRP-USD, the native cryptocurrency of Ripple Labs, showed a significantly higher cumulative return than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  However, its performance is highly volatile, as indicated by large maximum drawdowns (MDD) and fluctuating alpha and beta values. Recent price movements suggest a slight downward trend.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Company Overview:** XRP-USD is a cryptocurrency used for payments and remittances on the Ripple network.
* **Cumulative Return (XRP-USD):** 382.93%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 75.48%
* **Return Difference:** 307.4%  (This shows XRP significantly outperformed VOO at the last recorded date.  Note that the relative divergence of 38.7% indicates the current difference is near the upper-middle range of historical differences).

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals considerable volatility and inconsistent correlation with the market.  The near-zero betas in the earlier periods suggest very low correlation with the market, while later periods show slightly positive correlation. The high CAGR in some periods is offset by extremely negative CAGRs in others and significant MDDs.  This highlights the high-risk nature of XRP-USD.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 2.338
* **Last Market Price:** 2.110
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 2.405
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 2.328
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 2.493

The price is currently below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downward trend.  The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average. The relatively large negative change in the 'Last-market' data (-1.24%) suggests a recent price drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.428 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 54.53 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.42 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, though not extremely strong)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.1% (Short-term bearish)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 72.7% over the long term (2+ years).  This high expected return is likely due to the high risk and volatility inherent in cryptocurrency investments.

The combination of indicators paints a picture of moderate risk with a potential for growth, but considerable volatility must be considered.  The large negative price change in the 'Last-market' data (-1.24%) confirms a recent price drop and might indicate a potential short-term correction.  The high long-term expected return should be interpreted cautiously given the inherent risks associated with XRP-USD's volatile nature.  Past performance is not indicative of future results, especially in a highly volatile asset like XRP.
