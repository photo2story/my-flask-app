## XRP-USD Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

XRP-USD, a cryptocurrency representing Ripple's native token, shows a cumulative return of 495.38% over an unspecified period.  This is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 99.10% over the same period. The difference in cumulative returns is 396.3%, placing its relative divergence at the 43.1st percentile based on historical data. This indicates strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500, though past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided alpha and beta values show significant volatility and negative alpha for most periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market. The positive alpha and CAGR in the 2019-2021 and 2022-2024 periods are noteworthy but may be subject to significant risk.  The high beta values suggest substantial market sensitivity.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -70.0%    | 45.9%   | -86.0% | -0.1  | 10.0   |
| 2018-2020  | -339.0%   | 66.5%   | -366.0%| -0.1  | 11.0   |
| 2019-2021  | 162.0%   | 66.5%   | 91.0%  | -0.1  | 42.0   |
| 2020-2022  | 25.0%    | 66.5%   | 16.0%  | -0.1  | 17.0   |
| 2021-2023  | 70.0%    | 43.2%   | 46.0%  | -0.1  | 31.0   |
| 2022-2024  | 423.0%   | 30.2%   | 383.0% | -0.1  | 122.0  |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Price:** 2.42
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 2.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 1.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.95

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  However, the significant difference between the short-term and long-term moving averages indicates price volatility.  The Last-market price of 2.14, if significantly impactful, suggests a recent rapid price increase from 2.14 to 2.42.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (74.78):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.0877):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+13.6):**  Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.

The combination of a high RSI and positive PPO suggests conflicting signals, requiring further analysis.


**4. Expected Return:**

The provided expected return of -30% is significantly negative.  This, coupled with the high volatility and negative alpha observed in several historical periods, raises concerns about long-term investment suitability compared to the S&P 500.  Further analysis is needed to understand the basis for this expected return projection.


**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or profit data is available for XRP-USD, reflecting the nature of cryptocurrencies as non-traditional assets.  Traditional financial ratios are not applicable in this context.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific earning news or analyst opinions were provided.  Information on recent market outlook and other news related to XRP-USD (e.g., regulatory developments, market sentiment) is crucial for a complete analysis and is missing from this report.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

XRP-USD has demonstrated significant price appreciation exceeding that of the S&P 500 in certain periods. However, its high volatility, negative alpha (in several periods), and lack of traditional financial data present substantial risk. The current price action shows short-term bullish momentum, but the high RSI and negative expected return warrant caution.  A deeper dive into recent news, regulatory updates, and market sentiment is necessary before forming a conclusive investment opinion.  The current price may be experiencing a short-term spike from a lower price point.  The significant divergence between the short-term and long-term moving averages indicates considerable risk.
