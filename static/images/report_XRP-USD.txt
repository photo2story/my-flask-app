## XRP-USD Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

XRP-USD, a cryptocurrency representing Ripple's network, has shown significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, although with substantial volatility. Recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, indicated by moving averages and RSI.  However, the expected long-term return significantly surpasses that of the S&P 500.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

XRP-USD's cumulative return of 353.14% vastly outperforms the S&P 500's 69.73% return.  The relative divergence of 283.4, representing 36.3% on a scaled range, highlights XRP-USD's significant outperformance. However, this is crucial to understand this outperformance is highly volatile.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly inconsistent performance across different periods.  While positive alphas (outperformance relative to the market) are present in recent years, extremely negative CAGRs (Compound Annual Growth Rates) demonstrate substantial periods of significant losses. Beta values close to zero in the past and approaching one in the last couple years suggest a decreasing independence from the overall market movement. This highlights the high risk associated with investing in XRP-USD.  The large market capitalization fluctuations over time also indicate variability in the overall market interest and the influence of external factors.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $2.058
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $2.090
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $2.293
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $2.393

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4381 (Low to Medium Risk).
* **RSI:** 23.31 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for upward bounce but not confirming upward trend).
* **PPO:** -1.33 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum).
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -5.3% (Short-term downtrend).
* **Price Change:** The recent 1.62% increase is a relatively small change and doesn't signal a significant reversal.
* **Expected Return:** 92.4% (over S&P 500 over the long term). This high expected return should be viewed with caution given the inherent volatility of XRP-USD and past performance.


**Conclusion:**

XRP-USD has demonstrated remarkable long-term returns compared to the S&P 500 but with significant volatility and substantial downside risk. The current technical indicators suggest a short-term downtrend. While the projected long-term return is promising, investors should be aware of the high risk associated with this cryptocurrency and diversify their portfolio accordingly. The high expected return must be considered in the context of the high risk associated with the asset.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.
