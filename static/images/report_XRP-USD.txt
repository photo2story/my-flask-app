## XRP-USD Stock Analysis Report

**0. Overview:**

XRP-USD, representing Ripple's XRP cryptocurrency, exhibits significant volatility and high potential returns, but also carries substantial risk.  The following analysis examines its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) and various technical indicators.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

XRP-USD is a cryptocurrency representing Ripple's native token used within its payment network.

* **Cumulative Return (XRP-USD):** 463.71%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 38.54%
* **Return Difference:** 425.2%
* **Relative Divergence:** 48.8% (This means XRP-USD's performance relative to VOO currently lies at the 48.8th percentile of its historical range of divergence.  It does *not* imply a 48.8% outperformance.)


The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly volatile performance.  While impressive CAGR figures are presented (particularly in recent years), the massive Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight the extreme risk involved.  The Beta values, significantly greater than 1, confirm XRP's high sensitivity to market movements.  The fluctuating Beta further illustrates the inherent instability of this asset.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -44.0%  | 64.6%  | -61.0%| 0.1   | 10.7   |
| 2018-2020  | -301.0% | 66.5%  | -327.0%| 0.1   | 12.2   |
| 2019-2021  | 215.0%  | 77.1%  | 170.0%| 0.1   | 46.3   |
| 2020-2022  | 70.0%   | 77.1%  | 66.0% | 0.0   | 19.2   |
| 2021-2023  | 172.0%  | 77.1%  | 160.0%| 0.5   | 34.7   |
| 2022-2024  | 614.0%  | 75.4%  | 600.0%| 0.5   | 115.8  |
| 2023-2025  | 392.0%  | 75.4%  | 380.0%| 0.3   | 114.2  |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $2.05
* **Last Market Price:** $1.96
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $1.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $2.18
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $2.35

The price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend.  The negative change from the previous close (-0.37%) indicates a recent slight decrease in price.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.05 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -1.0693 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 102.8% (This represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, but it is crucial to remember the high volatility and risk inherent in XRP-USD)

The combination of a relatively low RSI, a negative PPO, and recent price decline points to potential further downside. However, the positive relative divergence suggests some short-term upward pressure, potentially indicating a temporary correction within a larger downward trend. The high expected return is a significant draw, but only for risk-tolerant investors willing to stomach substantial losses for potential long-term gains.  The substantial past volatility and current below-average price movement necessitates caution.
