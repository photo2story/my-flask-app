Okay, here's an analysis of XRP-USD based on the information you provided.

**Report on XRP-USD**

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** XRP-USD
*   **Company Overview:** XRP-USD represents a cryptocurrency, not a traditional company, and functions as a digital asset designed for payments.
*   **XRP-USD Cumulative Return:** 600.93%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 79.90%
*   **Spread (vs. VOO):**
    *   Max Spread: 954.0
    *   Min Spread: -58.7
    *   Current Spread: 535.3
    *   Relative Spread: 58.7

**Analysis:** XRP-USD has significantly outperformed VOO (S&P 500) based on cumulative returns. However, the "Relative Spread" of 58.7 indicates that while the current outperformance is substantial, it's not at the absolute peak of its historical range relative to VOO. The high volatility of XRP is also evident, given the large difference between the max and min spread.

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Average Growth Rate shows highly variable performance, with periods of significant losses (e.g., 2018-2020) and massive gains (e.g., 2022-2024). This highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of XRP-USD.

*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are also highly variable. Positive alpha indicates outperformance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500), while negative alpha indicates underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, suggesting that XRP-USD's price movements are not highly correlated with the S&P 500. In several periods, beta is zero or negative, meaning its changes are independent of the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap based on billions of XRP, it's increasing consistently.

**Analysis:** The price is currently above the 5-day moving average but below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. The recent price change of +2.29% and the price being above the 5-day moving average suggests a short-term upward trend.
