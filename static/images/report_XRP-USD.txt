## XRP-USD Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

XRP-USD, a cryptocurrency representing Ripple's native token, shows a cumulative return of 462.32% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 91.77%.  This represents a significant divergence of 370.55 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 40.8% indicates that the current performance is positioned in the upper 40th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  However,  historical volatility is substantial, as evidenced by the CAGR and MDD figures.

**Company Overview:** XRP-USD is a cryptocurrency used on the Ripple network for facilitating cross-border payments.

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2017-2019  | -70.0%    | 45.9% | -0.0  | 11.0  |       |
| 2018-2020  | -339.0%   | 66.5% | -0.0  | 13.0  |       |
| 2019-2021  | 162.0%   | 66.5% | -0.0  | 48.0  |       |
| 2020-2022  | 25.0%    | 66.5% | -0.0  | 20.0  |       |
| 2021-2023  | 70.0%    | 43.2% | -0.0  | 36.0  |       |
| 2022-2024  | 390.0%   | 30.2% | -0.0  | 131.0 |       |


**Note:**  The significant negative CAGRs highlight substantial periods of underperformance.  The high beta values indicate a strong correlation with market volatility, but also a potential for amplified returns (and losses).  The alpha consistently near zero suggests minimal excess return compared to the market, although this is likely influenced by the high beta.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $2.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $2.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $2.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $1.33

The price is currently below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  It's significantly above the 60-day moving average, however.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.94 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -4.00 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -1.7 (Short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -15.6% (relative to S&P 500)

The current price of $2.29 isn't exceptionally high or low based on the provided moving averages, but the negative PPO and downward relative strength change suggest caution.  The negative expected return indicates a lower projected long-term performance than the S&P 500.


**4. Financial Information:**

No financial data (revenue, gross profit, etc.) is available for XRP-USD as it is a cryptocurrency, not a publicly traded company in the traditional sense.


**5. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Earnings News (Past 2 days):**  Not applicable to cryptocurrencies.
* **Recent Market Outlook:** The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and subject to regulatory uncertainty, especially concerning XRP and Ripple's ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Market sentiment towards XRP can fluctuate significantly based on news related to this case.
* **Analyst Opinions and Performance Highlights:** Analyst opinions on XRP are varied and often depend on their outlook on the outcome of the Ripple SEC lawsuit and the overall cryptocurrency market.  It is crucial to consult multiple sources for a balanced perspective, keeping in mind that this is a highly speculative asset.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

XRP-USD has demonstrated significant historical volatility and periods of extreme performance, both positive and negative. While the current cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500, the past few years have shown significant periods of underperformance.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 and negative PPO value suggest a bearish outlook in the short-term. Technical indicators are mixed, and the substantial uncertainty surrounding the legal issues involving Ripple adds considerable risk.  Investing in XRP-USD requires a high-risk tolerance.  Long-term investors should carefully consider the ongoing regulatory uncertainty and market volatility before making any investment decisions.  Diversification is strongly recommended.
