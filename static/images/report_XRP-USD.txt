## XRP-USD Investment Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

This report analyzes the performance of XRP-USD, a cryptocurrency representing Ripple's network, against the S&P 500 (VOO) benchmark.  While XRP-USD has exhibited significantly higher cumulative returns than VOO, it also demonstrates higher volatility and risk, as evidenced by its alpha and beta values. The current technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment, though long-term prospects depend heavily on regulatory developments and market sentiment.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

XRP-USD is a cryptocurrency developed by Ripple Labs for faster and cheaper international money transfers.

The cumulative return of XRP-USD is significantly higher than that of VOO (646.33% vs 97.33%). The relative divergence shows XRP-USD's performance is currently at the 57.1 percentile of its historical range against VOO's performance (max: 1020.4%, min: -77.2%, current: 549.0%). This highlights the vast difference in performance but also its inherent volatility.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a complex picture:

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -70.0%  | 45.9%   | -86.0% | -0.1   | 11.1    |
| 2018-2020  | -339.0% | 66.5%   | -366.0%| -0.1   | 12.7    |
| 2019-2021  | 162.0%  | 66.5%   | 91.0%  | -0.1   | 47.9    |
| 2020-2022  | 25.0%   | 66.5%   | 16.0%  | 0.0    | 19.9    |
| 2021-2023  | 70.0%   | 43.2%   | 46.0%  | 0.2    | 35.9    |
| 2022-2024  | 338.0%  | 30.2%   | 305.0% | 0.3    | 119.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 637.0%  | 26.3%   | 577.0% | 2.2    | 176.7   |

Early years show negative alpha and beta close to zero, implying underperformance relative to the market and low correlation.  However, recent years show a significant positive alpha and increasing beta, indicating substantial outperformance and increased market correlation.  This volatility underscores the high risk associated with XRP-USD investment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 3.0683
* **Last Market Price:** 3.0908
* **Previous Close:** 3.1307
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 3.0637
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 2.9764
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 2.5538

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, indicating recent minor downward pressure.  However, it sits above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The recent price change shows a small decrease (-1.28%), suggesting minor short-term bearish pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (45.19):**  Indicates a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment;  below 50 suggests bearish momentum.
* **PPO (-1.23):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):**  -2.1% shows a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.1%):** This represents a minimal expected return for XRP-USD in the near term.

The provided data point to a bearish bias, but it's crucial to remember this is based on a limited snapshot. The market is heavily influenced by regulatory uncertainty.

**Long-Term Investment (2+ years):**  While XRP-USD's past performance has significantly outperformed VOO, its extremely high volatility makes long-term projections challenging.  A long-term investment strategy requires a high risk tolerance. The 0.1% expected return (relative to a long-term baseline) is far too low to justify this investment without additional research into possible future price changes based on Ripple's legal battles and cryptocurrency market conditions.  Any investment decision should be made only after thorough due diligence and consideration of your individual risk profile.
