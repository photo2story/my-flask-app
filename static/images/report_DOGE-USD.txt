    *   **Low Beta:** Beta values are generally low, suggesting relatively low correlation with the overall market (S&P 500).

*   **5-day Moving Average:** 0.2406
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 0.2559
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 0.2337

*   **Analysis:** The price is currently below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating a potentially stronger longer-term trend. The recent price drop reflects negative change.

**3. Technical Indicators & Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended). *Note: This seems counterintuitive given the volatility and other indicators.*

*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4356 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 2.5% (positive - short-term increase in relative performance vs. VOO)
*   **Expected Return:** 4343.9% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500, if dollar-cost averaging).

*   **Analysis:**  While the MRI strangely suggests high investment potential, other indicators paint a more cautious picture. RSI is neutral, and PPO indicates weakening momentum. The expected return is extremely high, but given the volatility and historical performance, it should be viewed with skepticism. The recent divergence change suggests a short-term relative outperformance.
*   **Price Fluctuation Note:**  The price change of -2.06% indicates a recent downward price movement.

**4. Recent News & Events**
