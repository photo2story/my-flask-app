**0. Introduction**

This report analyzes the performance and outlook for Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) based on provided financial data, technical indicators, recent news, and comparisons to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Return Rate Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** DOGE-USD
*   **Company Overview:** Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that originated as a meme-based altcoin but has gained significant popularity and market capitalization.
*   **Cumulative Return of DOGE-USD:** 2781.94%
*   **Cumulative Return of S&P 500 (VOO):** 79.35%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current:** 2774.5
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 24.9

**Analysis:**

*   Dogecoin has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative return. The returns since 2017 are staggering, although the comparison uses rolling timeframes which could make it a bit more volatile.
*   The relative divergence of 24.9 suggests that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range, meaning divergence was higher in the recent past.
*   The divergence is extremely high and signals that Dogecoin is much more volatile than the broad market index (S&P500).

| 2020-2022  | 1798.0%| 86.2% | 1799.0%  | 0.0   | 10.7   |

| 2023-2025  | 425.0% | 82.8% | 360.0%   | 0.2   | 22.3   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows wildly varying returns across different periods, highlighting extreme volatility.  Negative CAGRs in the earlier periods demonstrate significant losses, while later periods show enormous gains.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating substantial potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** Large positive alphas in periods of high growth mean DOGE vastly outperformed what its beta would suggest.  Large negative alphas in periods of negative returns suggest it underperformed relative to its beta.
*   **Beta:** Generally low, indicating DOGE is not strongly correlated with the broader market index (S&P500). The Beta is more or less zero, indicating that the movement of the S&P 500 has virtually no impact on the stock movement.
*   **Cap(B):** Large values indicate strong capitalization relative to beta. This likely results from the high Dogecoin price volatility.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 0.1467
*   **Last-market:** price: 0.1467, previousClose: 0.1356, change: 8.24%
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.146
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.1518
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.184

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price increased by more than 8% in the most recent period.
*   The close price is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a recent downtrend. The 5-day SMA being equal to the current price is not particularly indicative.
*   The recent price increase could be an indication that the trend is reversing.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.09
*   **PPO:** 0.3854
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (Very Safe, MRI: 0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.7 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 10994.3%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a *high investment recommendation*, which is questionable considering the volatility and speculative nature of Dogecoin.  This should be interpreted cautiously.
*   The RSI of 40.09 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), suggesting a possible buying opportunity, but also suggesting the stock could be further oversold.
*   The PPO is close to zero, indicating a convergence of moving averages and possibly a change in momentum.
*   The hybrid signal leans towards buying, reflecting the MRI's high rating.
*   The negative change in relative divergence suggests a recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   The extremely high expected return is unrealistic and should be considered with extreme skepticism. It is likely a consequence of extrapolating recent price trends.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

Dogecoin is a highly volatile and speculative cryptocurrency with the potential for extreme gains and losses. Its performance is driven by social media trends, news events, and influential figures like Elon Musk. While it has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past, its high maximum drawdown, low Beta, and mixed news flow indicate that it carries substantial risk.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in Dogecoin is highly speculative and should only be considered by investors with a high-risk tolerance. The provided data suggests potential for further price swings and the need for caution. While the MRI indicates a "High Investment Recommended," this is questionable considering the volatility of the investment. Potential investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance, diversification strategies, and thoroughly research Dogecoin before investing. Given the wildly unrealistic "Expected Return," any investment decision should be made with a critical and discerning eye, and perhaps not be made at all.
