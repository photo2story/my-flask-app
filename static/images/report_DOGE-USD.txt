**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has shown extraordinary returns compared to the S&P 500 in the past, but this comes with extremely high risk and volatility, as evidenced by the high beta and large maximum drawdown (MDD).  Current indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend. While the expected long-term return is exceptionally high,  investors should proceed with extreme caution and understand the inherent risks associated with this highly volatile asset.  The high expected return should not be considered a guaranteed outcome.  Diversification is crucial for any investment strategy involving DOGE-USD.
