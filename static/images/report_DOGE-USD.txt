**1) Return Rate Comparison (DOGE vs. VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** DOGE-USD
*   **Company Name:** Dogecoin
*   **Overview:** Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency featuring a Shiba Inu dog meme as its logo and primarily known for its strong community and use in online tipping and charitable causes.

*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 78.07%
*   **Divergence:** The current divergence between Dogecoin and the S&P 500's cumulative returns is 2215.4. This means Dogecoin has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period for which the cumulative returns were calculated.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -41.0% | 77.8% | -49.0%  | 0.1   | 0.3    |
| 2018-2020  | -79.0% | 77.8% | -103.0% | 0.0   | 0.7    |
| 2019-2021  | 3411.0%| 78.0% | 3364.0% | -0.0  | 26.2   |
| 2020-2022  | 1798.0%| 86.2% | 1799.0% | 0.0   | 10.8   |
| 2021-2023  | 1963.0%| 86.2% | 1961.0% | 0.0   | 13.7   |
| 2022-2024  | 4779.0%| 86.2% | 4758.0% | 0.0   | 48.5   |
| 2023-2025  | -63.0% | 82.8% | -127.0% | 0.2   | 18.7   |

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate shows periods of significant gains (e.g., 3411% in 2019-2021) and substantial losses (e.g., -79% in 2018-2020). This highlights Dogecoin's extreme volatility.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant potential losses from peak to trough during each period.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are also extreme, mirroring the CAGR and demonstrating the potential for both significant outperformance and underperformance relative to a benchmark. High positive Alpha during boom periods indicates returns beyond what would be expected based on the market's overall movement.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, close to zero, especially during periods of high gains. This suggests Dogecoin's price movements were largely independent of the broader market (S&P 500) during those times. The higher Beta in 2023-2025 suggests a bit more market correlation during that period.
*   **Cap(B):** This metric shows an increase of USD value for every 1$ spend of comparison stock (S&P500)

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close Price:** 0.1218
*   **Last Market Data:** Price decreased from 0.1262 to 0.1229, a -2.58% change. This indicates a recent downward trend.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 0.1295
    *   20-day SMA: 0.1395
    *   60-day SMA: 0.1615

    All moving averages are above the current price, and the shorter-term averages (5-day, 20-day) are lower than the longer-term average (60-day). This confirms the current price is trending downwards.

**3) Indicators Analysis**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended) - This suggests that, according to the MRI, Dogecoin carries a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI:** 27.54 - This is below 30, indicating that Dogecoin is currently in oversold territory. This *could* suggest a potential for a price rebound, but doesn't guarantee it.
*   **PPO:** -0.6156 - This suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The system recommends 100% allocation to Dogecoin with a monthly investment.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** A negative change (-3.0) in recent relative divergence indicates a short-term decline in Dogecoin's performance relative to its comparison.
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return (15088.5%) should be viewed with extreme caution. Such high returns are highly unlikely and not guaranteed.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive News (Mid-September):** Several headlines from mid-September highlight a price surge in Dogecoin, potentially driven by speculation about a Dogecoin ETF and treasury-related moves influencing a company linked to Elon Musk's lawyer.
*   **Reverse Merger (Mid-October):** The news of The House of Doge going public through a reverse merger is a significant event that could impact the price. Reverse mergers are often volatile.
*   **Price Decline (Late September):** One headline points to a subsequent price plummet in Dogecoin.
*   **Overall Sentiment:** The news suggests a mixed sentiment with initial positive movement followed by a decline, typical of highly speculative assets.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   No analyst consensus or target price information was provided.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Dogecoin is a highly volatile cryptocurrency with the potential for both significant gains and substantial losses, as highlighted by its historical CAGR and MDD figures. Its price movements often appear independent of the broader market, as indicated by its Beta values.

**Recent Trend:** Dogecoin is currently in a downtrend, as evidenced by its price being below its moving averages and the negative recent divergence change. The RSI indicates it's oversold, which could lead to a temporary bounce, but doesn't guarantee a sustained reversal.

**News Impact:** The news cycle reflects the volatile nature of Dogecoin. Positive news related to potential ETFs and corporate actions triggered a price surge, but a subsequent price decline occurred.

**Investment Recommendation:**

The Market Risk Indicator suggests a "Medium Investment Recommended," but this should be interpreted cautiously. The extremely high "Expected Return" is unrealistic.

**In summary:** Dogecoin is a high-risk, high-reward investment. Due diligence and risk management are extremely important, and any investment should be sized accordingly. Pay close attention to market sentiment, technical indicators, and further news developments.
