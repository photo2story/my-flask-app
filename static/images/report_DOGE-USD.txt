## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

DOGE-USD, or Dogecoin, is a cryptocurrency and a meme-based peer-to-peer digital currency.  Its price has exhibited extreme volatility, resulting in significantly higher returns compared to the S&P 500.  Recent price movement suggests upward momentum, but high RSI indicates potential overbought conditions.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Dogecoin's cumulative return (4070.16%) vastly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (52.13%). The difference is 4018.0 percentage points.  This places its relative divergence at the 90th percentile of its historical range, suggesting an extremely high deviation from the market benchmark.

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals significant inconsistencies:  while earlier years show negative or near-zero alpha and low beta, recent years exhibit exceptionally high alpha and beta, reflecting the extreme volatility and sensitivity to market movements (particularly during the 2019-2025 periods).  The high beta values indicate that DOGE-USD’s price movements are extremely sensitive to overall market changes.  The large swings in Alpha showcase its high outperformance over the market (mostly during the periods of rapid growth).  It's crucial to note that these metrics might not accurately capture Dogecoin's future performance, given the speculative nature of the asset.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term downward pressure; indicates a recent decrease in the relative strength of the asset compared to the market)
* **Expected Return:** 5137.7% (This extremely high figure over a long-term period (2+ years) should be treated with extreme caution.  Dogecoin's price is highly speculative, and such a return is highly unlikely and not a reliable prediction.)


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has demonstrated exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500.  However, this has come with extreme volatility. The current price action shows short-term upward momentum, but high RSI and relatively high Market Risk Indicator levels suggest caution.  The projected long-term return should be considered highly speculative due to Dogecoin’s unpredictable nature.  Investing in Dogecoin requires a high tolerance for risk.  This report should not be considered financial advice; conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.
