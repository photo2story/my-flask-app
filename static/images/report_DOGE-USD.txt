2025-12-22 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) based on the provided data.

**Dogecoin (DOGE-USD): A cryptocurrency known for its meme-inspired origins.**

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Divergence:**

*   **Dogecoin Cumulative Return:** 2451.54%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 79.87%
*   **Divergence:** 2215.4
*   **Relative Divergence:** 19.9

**Analysis:**

Dogecoin's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500. However, the relative divergence of 19.9 indicates that the current divergence is relatively low compared to its historical range. This suggests that while Dogecoin has historically experienced much greater peaks in divergence, the current outperformance, while substantial, isn't at its extreme. This means it's closer to its divergence minimum than divergence maximum, which can imply different things, from the asset correcting or the asset consolidating, depending on further indicators.

| 2023-2025  | 95.0%   | 82.8% | 30.0%    | 0.2    | 21.8   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Shows explosive growth in some periods (2019-2021, 2022-2024) but also significant losses in others (2017-2019, 2018-2020). This highlights Dogecoin's volatile nature.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD values indicate substantial risk of significant losses.
*   **Alpha:** The high positive Alpha during growth periods suggests Dogecoin's returns are not correlated with the market (VOO), it is generating excess returns independently. The negative Alpha during loss periods further reinforces this.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally low, and even sometimes negative, indicating that Dogecoin is less sensitive to market movements than the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Indicates the annualized return, which is the discount rate at which the expected future cash flows of Dogecoin are equal to the current price.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 0.1299
*   **Previous Close:** 0.1319
*   **Change:** -1.56%
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.1292
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.1375
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.1584

**Analysis:**

Dogecoin's price decreased by 1.56% in the last trading session. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, which is a bearish signal. This suggests a short-term downward trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 42.35 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.0395 (Positive)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (7338 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.0 (Negative)
*   **Expected Return:** 15088.5%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Indicates a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 42.35 is considered neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The positive PPO suggests a potential upward trend in price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 100% of cash" signal with a "Very Safe" classification and high MRI (0.90) is contradictory to the rest of the data and should be discarded as outlier information.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decrease in relative divergence suggests a short-term downward trend or correction.
*   **Expected Return:** The extraordinarily high expected return should be viewed with extreme caution. It is unlikely to be a realistic projection, given the inherent volatility of Dogecoin.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance):**

*   **Mixed Headlines:** The news headlines paint a mixed picture. Some articles predict future price increases, while others discuss price declines. A reverse merger is also mentioned.

**Analysis:**

The news is a mix of positive and negative sentiment, typical for a volatile asset like Dogecoin. The reverse merger with Brag House (TBH:NASDAQ) is potentially a significant event that could impact Dogecoin's price and future prospects.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Dogecoin is a highly volatile cryptocurrency with the potential for significant returns but also substantial risk. Its historical performance has been characterized by explosive growth periods followed by significant drawdowns. While it has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past, current indicators suggest a potential short-term downward trend or consolidation.

**Investment Recommendation:**

Given the high volatility and speculative nature of Dogecoin, this is considered a high-risk investment. While the provided data suggests a medium investment risk, and a very high potential expected return, this would be inaccurate. Any investment in Dogecoin should be a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio, and investors should be prepared for the possibility of significant losses.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Reliance on Sentiment:** Dogecoin's price is heavily influenced by social media sentiment and meme culture, making it difficult to predict future performance.
*   **Regulatory Uncertainty:** The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could impact Dogecoin's price and utility.
