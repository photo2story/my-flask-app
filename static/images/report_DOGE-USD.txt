## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency, exhibits extremely high volatility and significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative returns. However, this performance is characterized by periods of substantial drawdown and high risk, as indicated by its beta and market risk indicators.  Recent price movements suggest a short-term upward trend, though this must be considered within the context of its inherent volatility.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

DOGE-USD is a meme-based cryptocurrency, lacking fundamental company analysis like a typical stock.

* **Cumulative Return (DOGE-USD):** 3900.47%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 49.49%
* **Return Difference:** 3851.0% (This reflects a massive outperformance of DOGE-USD compared to the S&P 500.  However, the high volatility makes this less meaningful than other metrics.)

The high and volatile beta values (especially 26.3 and 48.7) indicate significant price movements relative to the market, highlighting the high risk associated with DOGE-USD.  Alpha, while positive in several periods, is not consistently high, suggesting inconsistent outperformance beyond market risk. The large fluctuations in CAGR reflect the extreme volatility of the asset.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.1723
* **Last Market Price:** $0.1784 (3.49% increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.1775
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.1676
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.1726

The price is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The 3.49% increase in the last market price indicates a recent sharp upward move.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3721 (Medium Risk)  This suggests a moderate level of risk associated with the asset.

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 70.55 (Overbought). This suggests the asset is currently overbought, indicating a potential pullback.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 1.01 (Positive). This signals a bullish momentum, but it is crucial to remember that the RSI suggests it might be unsustainable in the short term.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.0 (Short-term downward trend) This is a discrepancy between price and momentum, suggesting a potential weakening of the current uptrend.

* **Expected Return:** 5431.3% (Long-term, over 2 years, against S&P 500). This extremely high number reflects the historical volatility and past returns of DOGE-USD, but it does not guarantee future performance. It's crucial to remember that the massive expected return is likely based on past highly volatile performance that is highly unlikely to repeat in the future.

**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD demonstrates substantial historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with exceptionally high risk and volatility.  The recent price increase may be a short-term trend, and the overbought RSI suggests a potential correction.  The high expected return should be viewed with extreme caution due to the inherent volatility and lack of fundamental support for its valuation.  Any investment decision should carefully consider the high risk involved.  The high beta and historical MDD suggest substantial drawdowns should be expected.  Long-term investors should be prepared for significant price fluctuations.
