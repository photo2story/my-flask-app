### 3. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 0.248863
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 0.24886318, 'previousClose': 0.23736873, 'change': 4.84}  (a 4.84% increase)

**Analysis:** The price experienced a significant 4.84% increase. The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but above the 60-day moving average. This suggests a possible short-term downtrend or consolidation, but still above longer-term support.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.434 (Medium Risk)
*   **RSI:** 53.2 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -1.22 (Potentially oversold, but not strongly so)

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -3.5 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 4095.2% (Over S&P 500, long-term)

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates medium risk. RSI is neutral, and PPO suggests a slightly oversold condition. The Hybrid Signal's recommendation to sell holdings and move to 99% cash is a very bearish signal, further reinforced by the recent decline in relative divergence. However, the extremely high expected return suggests potential long-term gains, assuming the investment thesis holds.
