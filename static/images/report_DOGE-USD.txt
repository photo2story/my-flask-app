*   **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:**  A negative change (-2.0) confirms the recent short-term underperformance compared to the benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (4401.8%) should be viewed with caution. While it suggests significant potential upside for long-term investment, the high volatility and risk associated with DOGE-USD make this a speculative estimate.

Monitoring news and market developments closely is crucial for managing risk.
