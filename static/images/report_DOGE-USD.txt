**1. Company Overview and Performance Analysis:**

Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) is a cryptocurrency created as a meme, but it has gained significant traction as a medium of exchange and speculative asset.  The provided data shows extraordinarily high cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), but this is heavily influenced by periods of extreme volatility and doesn't represent consistent outperformance.  The alpha and beta values fluctuate significantly year over year, highlighting the high risk associated with this asset. The extremely high beta values indicate significant sensitivity to market movements in some years.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |

| 2018-2020  | -23.0%   | 72.7%    | -0.50 | 0.1   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 3254.0%  | 63.1%    | 3210.0% | 0.1   |        |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $0.1604
* **Last Price:** $0.1562
* **5-day Moving Average:** $0.154
* **20-day Moving Average:** $0.1695
* **60-day Moving Average:** $0.199

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent price change of -2.63% indicates a short-term downward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (33.75):**  Indicates the asset is currently in oversold territory. This could signal a potential bounce, but it's not a guarantee.
* **PPO (-0.56):**  Suggests bearish momentum.  The negative value confirms the downward trend observed in the moving averages.
* **Relative Divergence Change (-0.6):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the benchmark.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI) (0.5289):** Classifies the investment as high risk.
* **Expected Return (5982.4%):** This exceptionally high projected return should be treated with extreme caution.  Past performance is not indicative of future results, especially for a highly volatile asset like Dogecoin.  This projection likely reflects the potential for substantial upside but also carries substantial downside risk.

**Conclusion:**

Dogecoin's past performance has been extraordinarily volatile, leading to substantial gains but also substantial losses. While the current oversold conditions (RSI) might suggest a short-term bounce, the negative PPO and downward trend in moving averages suggest continued bearish momentum. The high MRI value underscores the significant inherent risk. The projected long-term return is exceptionally high and should be viewed with skepticism given the inherent volatility of the asset and unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market.  Any investment in DOGE-USD should be considered a high-risk, speculative venture.  Diversification is crucial, and investors should only allocate a small portion of their portfolio to such a volatile asset.
