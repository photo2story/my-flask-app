## Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) Investment Review

**Executive Summary:** Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) is a cryptocurrency.  This report analyzes its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering historical data, recent price movements, and technical indicators.  Note that Dogecoin's extreme volatility and lack of intrinsic value make it a highly risky investment.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Dogecoin's cumulative return (4584.61%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's return (99.23%) as of the last data point. The absolute difference is 4485.4%.  The relative divergence of 19.6% indicates Dogecoin's performance is considerably higher than the S&P 500, relative to its historical range of divergence (from -45.3% to 23063.5%).  However, this extreme volatility is a major risk factor.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly variable results across different time periods. While periods of extremely high positive CAGR (e.g., 4929% from 2019-2021) are observed, it's also characterized by significant negative returns and high maximum drawdown (MDD). The Beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, is erratic, indicating extremely high market sensitivity.  The low and even negative alpha values in several periods highlight the lack of consistent excess return generation compared to the market.

* **20-day Moving Average:** $0.2829
* **60-day Moving Average:** $0.3261

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 32.02 –  This indicates the asset is currently in oversold territory.  However, RSI should be interpreted cautiously for extremely volatile assets like Dogecoin.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.25 – A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, but its meaning is limited without considering the context of the asset's volatility and historical PPO readings.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.9 – This suggests a short-term upward trend in relative strength.

* **Expected Return:** 8726.9% –  This represents a *projected* long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500.  This projection is extremely high and relies on several assumptions that are highly uncertain, especially considering the historical volatility of Dogecoin. This projection should be treated with extreme caution.
