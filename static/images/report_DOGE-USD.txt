## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

DOGE-USD, commonly known as Dogecoin, is a cryptocurrency.  Its performance significantly outpaces the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison:**

* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 3379.28%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 93.55%
* **Return Difference:** 3285.7% (This shows that Dogecoin has outperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the measured period).  The relative divergence of 14.4% indicates that its performance lies towards the higher end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500, but it is not necessarily an indication of future performance.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show a highly volatile and unpredictable asset.  Negative alphas in earlier periods indicate underperformance against a benchmark (likely due to market conditions). The large positive alphas and high betas in later periods point to extreme price swings and high sensitivity to market movements. This suggests that Dogecoin is a very high-risk, high-reward asset with little correlation to the broader market.  The significant increase in beta from 0.3 to 48.3 over the examined period highlights its increasing volatility and its potential for massive gains or losses.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.20196
* **Last Market Price:** $0.20832 (a slight increase from the previous close)
* **Previous Close:** $0.23925 (showing a recent price drop)
* **Change:** -12.93% (significant negative change compared to the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.2074
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.2439
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.305

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 14.78  This indicates the asset is in oversold territory.  However,  RSI should be used cautiously with cryptocurrencies due to their high volatility.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.42  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.8%  This confirms the recent short-term downward trend.

* **Expected Return:** 12628.7%  This extremely high expected return reflects the high volatility and potential for significant gains (but also significant losses) inherent in Dogecoin.  However, this projection is highly uncertain given the asset's high risk.

**The significant price drop from the previous close (-12.93%) suggests a recent negative event or trend that triggered a sell-off.** The very high expected return should be viewed with extreme caution and is not a guarantee of future performance.  Dogecoin's high volatility makes long-term predictions unreliable.  Any investment should be made only after careful consideration and risk assessment.
