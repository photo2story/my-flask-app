    *   **CAGR:** Volatile, ranging from -79% to 4779%, reflecting Dogecoin's speculative nature.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Consistently high, indicating significant price swings and risk.
    *   **Alpha:**  Generally positive, showing outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but significantly negative in certain periods (2017-2019, 2018-2020, 2023-2025). This indicates that Dogecoin's performance is not always consistent and can significantly underperform.
    *   **Beta:**  Near zero for most periods, but a beta above zero in 2017-2019 and 2023-2025 indicates a slight correlation with the market.  The volatile returns are far more idiosyncratic than correlated with the general market.
    *   **Cap(B):** Highly variable, with a high in 2022-2024 (48.5), representing periods of high market capitalization changes.

    *   **20-day SMA:** 0.1395
    *   **60-day SMA:** 0.1615

    The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The fact that the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, further reinforces this bearish signal.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 27.54 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.6156 (Negative, indicating a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash" (Very Safe - MRI: 0.90). This signal suggests that, according to the model, it is a good time to buy Dogecoin.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 15088.5%

    The RSI indicates that Dogecoin is currently oversold, which could suggest a potential for a price rebound. However, the PPO is negative, reinforcing the downtrend. The MRI is at 0.7, which is at the lower end of the "Medium Investment" range, suggesting that the market conditions are not highly favorable. The large expected return suggests significant potential upside if held long-term, but should be viewed skeptically given the historical volatility.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Dogecoin's performance is characterized by extreme volatility and outperformance compared to the S&P 500, as evidenced by its high CAGR and MDD figures. Its alpha varies considerably across different periods, showcasing its potential for both significant gains and losses compared to the market. The current technical indicators point to a short-term downtrend, with the price below key moving averages and an oversold RSI. The MRI indicates a medium level of market risk, but the "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash" hybrid signal suggests a potentially opportune buying point based on the model's criteria.

The recent news headlines reflect the speculative nature of Dogecoin, with positive catalysts like the potential ETF launch and treasury moves contrasted by days of significant price declines. The reverse merger news could have implications, but its impact is uncertain.

**Overall Recommendation (Cautious):**

Investing in Dogecoin remains highly speculative. The potential for high returns is evident, but it comes with substantial risk. Consider the following:

*   **Short-term:** The technical indicators suggest caution in the short term due to the current downtrend.
*   **Long-term:** If you believe in the long-term potential of Dogecoin and are comfortable with extreme volatility, a small, well-considered investment might be appropriate. However, be prepared for potentially large losses.
*   **News & Events:** Monitor news and events closely, as they can have a significant impact on Dogecoin's price.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Only invest what you can afford to lose, given Dogecoin's high volatility.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** Without analyst consensus or target prices, investment decisions should be based on personal research and risk assessment.
