**Analysis:**

DOGE-USD has exhibited exceptionally high cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), significantly exceeding it by 4306.27%. However, this drastic difference is largely influenced by its volatile nature, highlighted by the large swings in its historical performance (max 28736.5%, min -27.3%). The high relative divergence suggests that its current performance is relatively weaker than during the most extreme historical bullish periods, although still significantly above average.

The provided CAGR data shows extreme volatility.  While several periods boast incredibly high growth, others demonstrate substantial negative returns. The high Beta values (particularly in 2019-2021 and 2022-2024) indicate significant price movements relative to the overall market, confirming its high risk profile.  Alpha values fluctuate but tend to be positive, suggesting some level of outperformance.  However, given the immense volatility, these figures should be interpreted cautiously.

The current price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), which suggests a downtrend. The RSI value below 50 further reinforces this bearish sentiment.  Although the PPO is positive, its relatively low value suggests the bullish momentum is weak. The recent negative 20-day relative divergence change also supports the short-term bearish outlook.  The large negative percentage change from the previous close (-1.68%) indicates a recent price drop.

The MRI suggests low to medium risk.  The expected return of 17254.5% over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years) is highly speculative and relies on assumptions about future price volatility which may or may not materialize.  It's crucial to understand that this is a high-risk investment, and past performance is not indicative of future results.  The substantial volatility calls for careful consideration and possibly a diversified portfolio strategy rather than relying solely on DOGE-USD.
