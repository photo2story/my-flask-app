## DOGE-USD Investment Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

DOGE-USD is a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin network.  The cumulative return of DOGE-USD is significantly higher (7201.74%) than that of the S&P 500 (VOO) at 99.47% over the observed period. The difference in cumulative returns is 7102.27%, placing it at the 90th percentile of its historical relative divergence against the S&P 500 (based on provided data).  This shows extremely high relative performance against the benchmark. However, the provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data demonstrates significant volatility and periods of substantial negative returns.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2017-2019  | -96.0%    | 49.9% | -113.0% | -0.0 | 0.0 |
| 2018-2020  | -157.0%   | 49.9% | -184.0% | -0.0 | 1.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 4929.0%  | 26.6% | 4859.0% | -0.0 | 25.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 1547.0%  | 36.4% | 1538.0% | -0.0 | 10.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 98.0%    | 36.4% | 75.0% | -0.0 | 13.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 3224.0%  | 39.4% | 3184.0% | -0.0 | 61.0 |

The high volatility and inconsistent performance highlighted by the CAGR and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures are crucial considerations.  The near-zero beta values indicate a very low correlation with the broader market, characteristic of high-risk, speculative assets.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** 0.429
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 0.421
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.2851

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's above its 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term upward trend.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -2.90 - Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.4 - Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 6696.4% -  This exceptionally high projected return, while based on historical data, must be viewed with extreme caution due to the inherent volatility of DOGE-USD.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

DOGE-USD has exhibited extraordinary returns compared to the S&P 500, but this performance is characterized by extreme volatility and periods of significant losses. The high expected return is enticing, but the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrencies, especially meme coins like Dogecoin, cannot be ignored.  Technical indicators suggest a slightly bearish short-term trend but a longer-term potential upward trajectory is possible.  However, this analysis is heavily dependent on the inclusion of the missing news and recent market developments (section 4).  **A long-term investment should only be considered after a thorough understanding of cryptocurrency risk and after reviewing recent news and market sentiment.**  The incredibly high expected return should be treated with skepticism given the volatile nature of DOGE-USD.  The low correlation with the broader market (low beta) further emphasizes its high-risk, high-reward profile.
