## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**Executive Summary:** DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin meme, exhibits extremely volatile performance with high growth potential but also significant risk.  While past performance shows substantial returns exceeding the S&P 500, its extreme volatility and lack of fundamental valuation metrics make predicting future returns challenging.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 3929.84%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 48.68%
* **Return Difference:** 3881.2%  This indicates a massive outperformance of DOGE-USD compared to the S&P 500. However, this is heavily influenced by extreme volatility (max difference 15239.2%, min -31.5%), as reflected in the relative divergence of 25.6%.  This high relative divergence suggests that while DOGE-USD has significantly outperformed in the past, the probability of such extreme gains repeating is relatively low.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta data highlight the extreme volatility and high risk associated with DOGE-USD.  The high Beta values (especially in 2019-2021 and 2022-2024) indicate extreme sensitivity to market movements. While Alpha values suggest periods of outperformance, these are unreliable indicators given the volatile nature of the asset.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is highly misleading given the significant fluctuations shown in MDD (Maximum Drawdown).

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -26.0%   | 75.6%   | -41.0% | 0.0   |        |
| 2018-2020  | -14.0%   | 75.6%   | -43.0% | 0.0   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 3416.0%  | 63.1%   | 0.1   | 23.7  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 1654.0%  | 74.4%   | 0.2   | 9.5   |        |
| 2021-2023  | 940.0%   | 74.4%   | 0.5   | 12.7  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 4186.0%  | 81.0%   | 0.4   | 43.9  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 1708.0%  | 81.0%   | 0.3   | 23.8  |        |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $0.171098
* **Last Market Close:** $0.160049
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.1676
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.1739
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.2073

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it is still significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term bearish trend. The recent price change of -5.32% from the previous close suggests a minor correction or short-term downward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.475 (High Risk)  This suggests a high level of risk associated with the current market conditions for DOGE-USD.
* **RSI:** 52.37  Slightly above neutral (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.40  Positive value, indicating bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -1.6% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 5886.7% This exceptionally high expected return highlights the potential for significant gains but also underscores the extreme risk involved.  This projection needs to be viewed with extreme caution given the historical volatility.  Such returns are unlikely to be consistent.

**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD presents an exceptionally high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. Past performance, while showing remarkable gains, is not indicative of future results.  The extreme volatility, indicated by the high Beta, MDD, and relative divergence, necessitates a very cautious approach.  The high expected return is predicated on a continuation of past extreme upward trends, which is unlikely to be a sustainable pattern.  Thorough due diligence and a high risk tolerance are absolutely essential before considering any investment in DOGE-USD.  Diversification is crucial to mitigate the high risk associated with this asset.
