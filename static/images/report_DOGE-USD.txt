## Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) Investment Review

**Executive Summary:** Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) is a cryptocurrency, a decentralized digital currency.  This report analyzes its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) based on provided data.  While DOGE has shown periods of extremely high returns, its volatility and negative alpha in several periods raise significant concerns.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

The cumulative return for DOGE-USD is 4584.61%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 99.23%.  The reported divergence is 4485.4, placing it at the 90th percentile (19.6% relative divergence) of historical divergence values. This highlights DOGE's extreme volatility and high risk.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -96.0%   | 49.9%    | -0.0   | 0.3   |        |
| 2018-2020  | -157.0%  | 49.9%    | -0.0   | 0.7   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 4929.0%  | 26.6%    | -0.0   | 25.8  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 1547.0%  | 36.4%    | -0.0   | 10.4  |        |
| 2021-2023  | 98.0%    | 36.4%    | 0.4    | 13.8  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 1484.0%  | 39.4%    | 0.4    | 47.8  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 2418.0%  | 39.4%    | 0.5    | 41.2  |        |

The highly variable beta (0.3 to 47.8) indicates substantial sensitivity to market fluctuations, particularly in certain periods. Negative alpha values in several years demonstrate underperformance compared to the market after adjusting for risk.  The positive alpha in recent years is likely driven by speculative behavior rather than fundamental strength.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.2719
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.2614
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.2829
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.3261

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (32.02):**  Indicates the asset is currently in oversold territory. This suggests potential for a price bounce but not necessarily a sustained uptrend.

* **PPO (0.25):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, but the relatively low value does not strongly confirm it.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (1.9+):** Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative divergence.

* **Expected Return (8726.9%):**  This extremely high expected return over the long term (2+ years) needs to be considered with extreme caution.  This projection is likely based on historical high-growth periods and does not account for the inherent volatility and speculative nature of DOGE.  It's not a reliable prediction.


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has demonstrated periods of remarkable returns, far surpassing the S&P 500. However, its extreme volatility, periods of negative alpha, and high beta highlight significant risks. While the current RSI and recent relative divergence suggest a potential short-term bounce, the long-term outlook remains highly uncertain.  The extremely high projected long-term return should be treated with skepticism.  Investing in DOGE requires a high tolerance for risk and a deep understanding of cryptocurrency markets.  It's crucial to consider this a highly speculative investment and not rely on past performance as an indicator of future results.
