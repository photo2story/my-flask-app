## DOGE-USD Investment Review

This report analyzes the performance of DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin network, and compares its returns against the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

DOGE-USD is a decentralized digital currency.  Its cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500.

* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 3490.72%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 42.12%
* **Return Difference:** 3448.6% (This indicates a substantial outperformance of DOGE-USD compared to the S&P 500. However, this is heavily influenced by periods of extreme volatility.)
* **Relative Divergence (0-100 scale):** 23.9% (This indicates DOGE-USD's performance is in the lower 24th percentile relative to its historical volatility compared to the S&P 500. This does not imply it underperformed, but rather it's currently less volatile than at other times in the historical range).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and significant variations in performance across different time periods:

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -27.0%   | 72.7%   | -0.0  | 0.3   |        |
| 2018-2020  | -23.0%   | 72.7%   | 0.0   | 0.7   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 3254.0%  | 63.1%   | 0.1   | 25.5  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 1530.0%  | 76.6%   | 0.1   | 10.2  |        |
| 2021-2023  | 960.0%   | 76.6%   | 0.4   | 13.6  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 4217.0%  | 80.4%   | 0.3   | 47.2  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 1439.0%  | 80.4%   | 0.3   | 23.1  |        |

Note the highly fluctuating Beta values, reflecting the extremely volatile nature of DOGE-USD.  High positive Alpha values indicate periods of significant outperformance against the market benchmark.  However, relying on past Alpha is risky given the highly speculative nature of the asset.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.154688
* **Last Market Price:** $0.155465
* **Previous Close:** $0.155753
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.1594
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.1617
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.187

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The price change from the previous close (-0.19%) shows a small decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.03 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.4539 (Positive; suggesting a bullish trend, though this should be interpreted cautiously in the context of high volatility.)
* **Recent Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.9 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 6294.6% (This extremely high expected return is highly speculative and relies on the assumption of continued extreme outperformance relative to the S&P 500, which is highly unlikely to be sustainable. Past performance is not indicative of future results.)

The small negative price change of -0.19% does not indicate a significant event requiring further analysis.


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has historically shown extreme volatility and periods of substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, this is highly unlikely to continue indefinitely.   The high expected return is highly speculative.  Investing in DOGE-USD carries significant risk, and any investment decision should be made after careful consideration of this risk and your own risk tolerance.  Relying solely on past performance is highly dangerous for this asset.
