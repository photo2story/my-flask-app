*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current Divergence:** 2215.4
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 19.9. This means the current divergence is relatively low compared to its historical range.
*   **Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Table:**

    *   The data reveals a period of significant volatility.
    *   **CAGR:**  Wide swings in annualized returns (CAGR).  Early periods (2017-2020) show significant losses, while later periods (2019-2024) show massive gains. 2023-2025 shows significant losses again.
    *   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD), highlighting the risk associated with Dogecoin.
    *   **Alpha:** Large positive Alpha values during the high-growth periods indicate Dogecoin's performance exceeded what would be expected based on its relationship with the market (S&P 500).  Negative Alpha values in losing periods show underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally low. High betas in 2019-2021 and 2022-2024 means more volatile than the S\&P500. Low or negative betas indicate less correlation with the S&P 500.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 - Suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** 27.54 - Indicates that Dogecoin is currently oversold, which could suggest a potential for a price rebound.
*   **PPO:** -0.6156 - The negative value of PPO suggests short-term downtrend.

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days confirms the short-term downtrend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return of 15088.5% is a projection and should be viewed with significant skepticism. It assumes that Dogecoin will continue its past high-growth trajectory, which is unlikely.
*   **Fluctuation Note:** The price change (-2.58%) indicates recent volatility.

*   There is no analyst consensus data provided.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Dogecoin is currently experiencing a downtrend, as indicated by its moving averages and recent price decrease. The RSI suggests it's oversold, which could lead to a potential bounce. However, the negative change in relative divergence and negative PPO confirm the short-term negative sentiment.

The news indicates that Dogecoin's price is highly susceptible to speculation and social media trends. Positive news catalysts, like the potential ETF launch and Elon Musk-related events, can drive the price up, while negative news leads to declines. The House of Doge going public is a significant event that could provide more legitimacy and stability.

The hybrid signal's recommendation of a full buy contrasts with the technical indicators and recent price action. The extremely high expected return is unrealistic and should not be the basis for investment decisions.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the high volatility, speculative nature, and recent downtrend, investing in Dogecoin is risky. The medium MRI suggests moderate risk, but the reliance on hype and news events makes it difficult to predict future price movements. While the RSI indicates a potential rebound, a cautious approach is advised.
