## DOGE-USD Investment Review

This report analyzes the performance of DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin token, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO) index.  Dogecoin is a decentralized digital currency known for its meme-based origins and community-driven development.


**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **Cumulative Return (DOGE-USD):** 3622.64%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 38.54%
* **Return Difference:** 3584.1%  (This shows a significantly higher return for DOGE-USD compared to VOO.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 24.8% (This indicates DOGE-USD's performance is in the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to VOO, not necessarily 24.8% better).

The provided alpha and beta data reveal high volatility and inconsistent performance relative to the market. While periods of exceptionally high returns (e.g., 3254% in 2019-2021) exist,  negative CAGR values are also observed,  demonstrating significant risk.  The high beta values (especially 24.4 and 45.1 in some periods) indicate extreme sensitivity to market movements.  This underscores the highly speculative nature of Dogecoin.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -27.0%   | 72.7%    | -44.0% | 0.1   |        |
| 2018-2020  | -23.0%   | 72.7%    | -50.0% | 0.1   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 3254.0%  | 63.1%    | 3210.0%| 0.1   |        |
| 2020-2022  | 1530.0%  | 76.6%    | 1526.0%| 0.2   |        |
| 2021-2023  | 960.0%   | 76.6%    | 947.0% | 0.3   |        |
| 2022-2024  | 4217.0%  | 80.4%    | 4203.0%| 0.3   |        |
| 2023-2025  | 1570.0%  | 80.4%    | 1559.0%| 0.3   |        |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.16037
* **Last Market Price:** $0.15399
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.154
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.1695
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.199

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 33.75 (Suggests oversold conditions, but in a volatile asset like DOGE, this should be interpreted cautiously.)
* **PPO:** -0.5643 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.6 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 5982.4% (This is a very high projected return, highly speculative, and should be considered with extreme caution given the inherent volatility of Dogecoin and the lack of fundamental basis for this prediction. This is simply what the data provides, not an endorsement of this likely unrealistic expectation).

The small positive change in the last market data (`change`: 0.23%) doesn't indicate a significant price jump or drop.  The high expected return is likely based on past highly volatile periods and should not be relied upon for future investment decisions.


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has shown periods of extremely high returns, but also significant periods of negative returns and high volatility. Its performance is vastly different from the relatively stable S&P 500.  The high beta signifies considerable market risk. The current technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  While the high projected return is intriguing, it's critically important to understand the extremely speculative nature of this cryptocurrency and the significant risk involved. Any investment decision should be based on a thorough understanding of this risk and should not rely solely on the past exceptionally high returns.  Conservative investors should avoid this asset.
