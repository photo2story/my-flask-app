## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

DOGE-USD, often referred to as Dogecoin, is a cryptocurrency and a decentralized digital currency.  The provided data shows significant volatility and high cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), although this performance is not consistently positive across all time periods.  Current indicators suggest a bearish trend.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 3292.51%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 88.92%
* **Return Difference:** 3203.6% (This signifies that DOGE-USD significantly outperformed VOO over the measured period.  However, note the highly volatile nature of DOGE-USD reflected in the wide range of past performance).
* **Relative Divergence:** 14.1% (This indicates that DOGE-USD's current outperformance compared to VOO sits at the 14.1% percentile of its historical range of outperformance/underperformance. This is not a measure of future performance.)

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha/Beta data shows extremely high volatility and inconsistent performance.  While periods of extreme positive returns exist (e.g., 2019-2021, 2020-2022, 2022-2024),  the negative CAGR values in some periods highlight the substantial risk associated with investing in DOGE-USD.  The high beta values (particularly in 2019-2021) further emphasize its sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The small positive alpha in recent years might be explained by the fact that Dogecoin is not a company or asset that provides a dividend or other traditional metrics and hence may not be fully accurate based on the usual measures of alpha.

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD       | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|

| 2018-2020  | -157.0%    | 49.9%     | -0.0   | 0.7   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 4929.0%   | 26.6%     | -0.0   | 25.2  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 1547.0%   | 36.4%     | -0.0   | 10.1  |        |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.1991
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.2107
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.2383
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.2994

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 31.89 (Below 30, suggesting the asset is oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.34 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum.)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -0.9 (Indicates a recent decline in relative strength).
* **Expected Return:** 12933.1% (This exceptionally high expected return, over a period of two years or more,  is likely based on historical highly volatile data that may not be representative of future performance. It should be interpreted with extreme caution.)

**The change in price (-0.056%) from the previous close is relatively small and not indicative of a significant price jump or drop.**  The negative values across several indicators combined (RSI below 30, negative PPO, declining relative strength) paints a bearish picture, and points to a high risk investment.

**Overall:**  DOGE-USD has demonstrated extreme volatility and significant returns in the past, but this should not be interpreted as a prediction of future performance.  The current indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend.  The extremely high expected return should be treated with significant skepticism due to the inherent volatility of this asset.  Any investment decision should be made after thorough research and consideration of your individual risk tolerance.
