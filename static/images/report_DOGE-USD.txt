*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR varies wildly. Negative values in early periods, followed by extremely high growth in later periods reflect the volatile nature of Dogecoin.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD values across all periods highlight the substantial risk and potential for significant losses.
*   **Alpha:**  The high Alpha values (especially in later periods) mean Dogecoin has outperformed its expected return based on its beta (risk) relative to the market.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values are unstable. The higher beta values in some periods suggest higher volatility and sensitivity to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** The 'Cap' values are not directly interpretable in this table without further context (e.g., market capitalization, trading volume).

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 0.2045
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 0.1880, Previous Close: 0.1963, Change: -4.25%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 0.2102
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 0.2355
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 0.2365

    Dogecoin's price is currently below all moving averages. The recent price decrease of -4.25% indicates a short-term bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 43.04 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -2.1996 (Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3736 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -3.1 (Short-term Decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** 4755.2% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

    The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, but the recent price drop and negative PPO suggest caution. The RSI is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The hybrid signal suggests buying, but given the recent downturn and negative momentum indicators, this should be approached with caution. The large "expected return" should be viewed skeptically, as it relies on past performance and doesn't guarantee future results, particularly given the volatility of Dogecoin. The recent 20-day relative divergence change reinforces the short-term bearish view. The significant negative change (-4.25%) in the last market data suggests a notable bearish event.

*   **Recent Downturn:** Recent price action is bearish, with the price below moving averages and a negative PPO.
*   **Lack of Relevant News:** The absence of Dogecoin-specific news makes it harder to identify short-term catalysts.
*   **Speculative Nature:** As a meme-inspired cryptocurrency, Dogecoin's value is heavily influenced by sentiment and social media trends, making it highly speculative.
*   **Unreliable Beta Values:** Beta values is unstable and meaningless.

**Conclusion:**

While the MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation and the hybrid signal indicates a buying opportunity, the bearish short-term indicators and speculative nature of Dogecoin warrant caution. This analysis is not a recommendation to buy or sell. It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your personal risk tolerance before investing in Dogecoin or any cryptocurrency. The provided "expected return" should be regarded cautiously due to Dogecoin's high volatility and dependence on market sentiment. The recent negative change in price suggests further downside potential.
