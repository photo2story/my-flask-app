* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 6769.2% (This is a projection of significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over a period of 2 years or more.  However, the extremely high volatility and speculative nature of DOGE-USD should be carefully considered.  This high expected return is driven largely by the historical data, which includes periods of extreme gains and losses.  The future performance may not align with this projection.)

**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has demonstrated extremely high volatility and periods of exceptional returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 at certain points.  However, this performance has not been consistent, and the recent price action suggests a downward trend. The high expected return projection should be viewed with extreme caution due to the inherent risk associated with this highly speculative asset.  Investors should conduct thorough due diligence and carefully assess their risk tolerance before investing in DOGE-USD.  The technical indicators currently suggest a bearish outlook, though the oversold RSI could indicate a potential short-term bounce.
