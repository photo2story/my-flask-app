## DOGE-USD Investment Review

**1. Performance Analysis:**

The difference between the cumulative returns is approximately 6904.3%, as of the last recorded date.  This large divergence is reflected in the high relative divergence value of 30.1%.  However, it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The provided CAGR data reveals extreme volatility with periods of massive gains and losses. While the periods 2019-2021 and 2022-2024 show substantial returns (4929% and 3026% respectively), the preceding periods show significant negative returns. The beta values fluctuate wildly, indicating high sensitivity to market movements in certain periods and near-zero correlation in others. This highlights the highly speculative nature of this asset.
