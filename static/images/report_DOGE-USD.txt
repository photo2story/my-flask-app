Okay, let's break down the provided Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) data and analyze its performance.

**1. Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** DOGE-USD (Dogecoin)
*   **Company Overview:** Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that originated as a meme based on the Shiba Inu dog.
*   **Dogecoin Cumulative Return:** 2405.62%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 73.30%
*   **Divergence:** 2163.2
*   **Relative Divergence:** 19.5

**Analysis:**

Dogecoin's cumulative return massively outperforms the S&P 500.  The sheer difference (2405% vs 73%) demonstrates the high-risk, high-reward nature of cryptocurrency investments, especially meme coins. The divergence of 2163.2 indicates the absolute difference in cumulative return. The relative divergence of 19.5 means the current divergence is relatively low compared to its historical range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR      | MDD   | Alpha     | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|-------|-----------|------|--------|
| 2018-2020  | -79.0%    | 99.9% | -100.0%   | 0.7  | 0.8    |
| 2019-2021  | 3411.0%   | 99.6% | 3368.0%   | 0.9  | 28.7   |
| 2020-2022  | 1798.0%   | 99.0% | 1800.0%   | 1.2  | 11.8   |
| 2021-2023  | 1963.0%   | 88.7% | 1962.0%   | 1.8  | 15.0   |
| 2022-2024  | 4779.0%   | 60.4% | 4759.0%   | 1.7  | 53.1   |
| 2023-2025  | -149.0%   | 76.3% | -211.0%   | 1.6  | 19.7   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR fluctuates wildly, showing periods of massive growth followed by significant losses. This high volatility is typical of Dogecoin.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD values (close to 100% in early periods) indicates significant potential for loss. More recent periods have lower MDDs, but a 76.3% MDD for 2023-2025 is still substantial.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is very high in positive growth periods, showing that Dogecoin is outperforming the market (S&P 500) by a huge margin. Conversely, the negative Alpha for 2018-2020 and 2023-2025 demonstrates Dogecoin's underperformance during down periods.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally above 1.0, indicating Dogecoin is more volatile than the S&P 500. This means Dogecoin's price tends to move more drastically than the overall market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 0.1286
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 0.12861328, 'previousClose': 0.12667692, 'change': 1.53} (Price increased by 1.53%)
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.1224
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.1268
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.1446

**Analysis:**

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, the price is still below the 60-day SMA, indicating that the longer-term trend may still be downwards. The 1.53% increase suggests a small positive momentum.

**3. Indicator Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - This is counter-intuitive, as Dogecoin is generally considered a risky investment.
*   **RSI:** 44.76 -  Neutral.  Below 50 suggests there's slightly more selling pressure than buying pressure, but not yet oversold.
*   **PPO:** 0.43 - The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is slightly positive.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (Very Safe - MRI: 0.90) - This signal is likely based on the MRI, which, as noted above, might be misrepresenting the risk.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (단기하락) - Indicates a short-term decrease in divergence.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 23379.99% - This is an extremely high expected return and should be viewed with extreme skepticism. It suggests Dogecoin is drastically undervalued based on the model used, and long-term investment (2+ years) may outperform S&P 500.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Reverse Merger:** The House of Doge going public via a reverse merger with Brag House (TBH:NASDAQ) is a significant event. This could bring more visibility and potentially more institutional investment to Dogecoin.
*   **ETF Debut:** The first U.S. Dogecoin ETF doubling forecast with $6M Debut is another positive sign, indicating growing mainstream acceptance of Dogecoin as an investment vehicle.
*   **Price Skyrockets:** News of Dogecoin massively outpacing Bitcoin and Ethereum gains will attract attention and potentially drive short-term price increases.
*   **Price Prediction:** The "DOGE Price Prediction" article is likely speculative and should be treated with caution.
*   **"Unleash Elon's Beast":** This article likely centers around the influence Elon Musk has on Dogecoin's price.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Dogecoin presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500, but this comes with extreme volatility as evidenced by high MDD values. Recent news seems generally positive: a reverse merger, the launch of a Dogecoin ETF, and price surges are positive indicators. However, an MRI of 0.9 suggesting it as a low risk, high reward investment is misleading. The high expected return should be treated with caution.
