## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency, shows significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods. However, this is accompanied by substantially higher volatility and risk, as evidenced by its high beta and maximum drawdown (MDD). Recent price action suggests a potential bearish trend, though its high expected return suggests long-term potential.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **Company Overview:** DOGE-USD is a decentralized digital currency.
* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 3616.09%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 38.05%
* **Return Difference:** 3578.04% (This is a substantial difference, indicating that DOGE-USD has massively outperformed the S&P 500.  However, this is not a reliable indicator of future performance.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 90th percentile (meaning the current divergence is in the top 10% of historical divergences, implying high deviation from S&P 500).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The table shows a high alpha and wildly fluctuating beta for DOGE-USD across different time periods. The high alpha suggests significant outperformance relative to the market, but this is likely attributable to extreme volatility rather than consistent outperformance.  The extremely high betas in recent years point to significant price sensitivity to market movements.

* **Last Market Price:** $0.158510

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.38 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.0247 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.8% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 5988.4% (This extraordinarily high expected return needs to be viewed cautiously given the high volatility inherent in DOGE-USD and the fact that it is a cryptocurrency, a very speculative asset class.)
* **Price Change:** A small positive change of 0.01 between `previousClose` and `price` is not significant enough to suggest a sudden upward or downward shift.

**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has historically shown exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with extremely high risk.  The current price is below its moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. While the expected return is exceptionally high, this should be considered in light of the inherent volatility and high risk associated with this cryptocurrency.  The high risk should be carefully considered before any investment decisions are made.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.
