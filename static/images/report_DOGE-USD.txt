## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency, has shown extreme volatility and significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, but with high risk.  Recent price action suggests a potential consolidation or slight downward trend.  The high expected return, despite volatility, suggests a potentially lucrative long-term investment *if* the current trend continues. However, this is highly uncertain given the inherent risk of cryptocurrencies.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **DOGE-USD Company Overview:** Dogecoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency.

* **Cumulative Return:** DOGE-USD: 3599.82%; VOO: 39.17%
* **Return Difference:** DOGE-USD significantly outperformed VOO by 3560.65 percentage points on the last day of the data.  However, this is a snapshot and ignores significant periods of underperformance.  The relative divergence of 24.7% indicates it's positioned relatively high compared to its historical range against VOO, but not necessarily indicating future outperformance.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided Alpha/Beta data reveals significant volatility and inconsistent performance against the market (Beta).  While several periods show exceptionally high returns (e.g., 2019-2021, 2020-2022), others show substantial losses (2017-2019, 2018-2020). The high Beta values in recent years indicate strong sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 0.159388
* **Last Market Price:** $0.1842 (3.09% increase from previous close)  This indicates a recent price jump.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 0.1571
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 0.1582
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.1787

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend, although the recent jump could signal a short-term reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk) – indicates a moderate level of risk.

* **RSI:** 56.94 – suggests the asset is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in a neutral territory.

* **PPO:** 0.72 – A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 – Indicates a recent decrease in relative strength.

* **Expected Return:** 6024.7% – This extremely high expected return relative to the S&P 500 is notable but needs to be viewed with caution given the substantial volatility inherent in DOGE-USD and the lack of fundamentals to support such high returns.  Past performance is not indicative of future results, especially in the highly speculative cryptocurrency market.


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD's performance has been highly volatile, with periods of extreme gains and losses. While its long-term potential relative to the S&P 500 seems high based on the provided data (6024.7% expected return), investors need to be acutely aware of the exceptionally high risk involved. The recent price jump should be interpreted cautiously, and further analysis is needed to confirm any sustained upward trend.  A long-term investment strategy needs careful consideration of risk tolerance, and diversification is highly recommended.  The high Beta suggests substantial market sensitivity, meaning that large swings in broader market conditions will likely cause significant price fluctuations in DOGE-USD.
