## Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) Analysis

**Company Overview:** Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that originated as a meme based on the Shiba Inu dog and has since gained popularity as a payment system and for its online community.

**1. Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Dogecoin Cumulative Return:** 2799.72%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 79.56%
*   **Divergence:** 2774.5 (Relative Divergence: 24.9)

*   **Beta:** Close to zero or even slightly negative, suggesting Dogecoin's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500).  The beta near zero during certain period might suggest less market correlation, while the larger beta toward the end of the period suggests increased influence.
