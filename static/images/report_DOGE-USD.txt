## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

DOGE-USD, or Dogecoin, is a cryptocurrency and a meme-based payment system.  The provided data shows significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, though with high volatility and negative returns in some years.  Recent price action indicates a downtrend, with the price below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages.  Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) suggest the asset is oversold and possibly entering a period of recovery, but this is not guaranteed.  Long-term expected returns are very high compared to the S&P 500, but this forecast must be viewed with extreme caution given the inherent risks of such a volatile asset.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 4423.13%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 99.22%
* **Return Difference:** 4323.91% (This is a massive difference)
* **Relative Divergence:** 18.9% (This indicates DOGE-USD's performance is in the upper 19th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, not an absolute measure of outperformance.)

The table below details the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta, and market capitalization across different periods. Note that the high CAGR and Alpha in recent years are accompanied by extremely high Betas indicating high volatility and correlation to market sentiment rather than inherent fundamental value.

* **Previous Close:** $0.2642

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price change shows a slight decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.19  (Oversold; often suggests a potential price bounce, but not guaranteed)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.36 (Negative; confirms the downtrend)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 1.1 (+) (Suggests a short-term upward trend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 9163.5% (This extremely high number requires a massive caveat.  The high expected return is primarily driven by the extremely high volatility and past performance of DOGE-USD which is not indicative of future returns.  This is not a reliable prediction.  High risk is inherent.)

The large negative change from the previous close (-0.605%) indicates a small but noticeable downward movement, reinforcing the downtrend indicated by the moving averages.
