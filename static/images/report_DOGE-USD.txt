**Analysis:**

*   DOGE-USD has shown *massive* outperformance compared to the S&P 500. The cumulative return difference is substantial.
*   The Relative Divergence of 30.3 suggests that while DOGE-USD is outperforming, it's not as extreme as it has been historically.
*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) varies wildly, reflecting the volatile nature of the asset.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures are very high, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are overwhelmingly positive and large, showing significant excess return compared to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are low, generally below 0.3, except for the 2019-2021 period, suggesting limited correlation with the S&P 500's movements. The low Beta values need to be interpreted with caution, especially given DOGE-USD's wild swings; they don't necessarily mean it's *less* risky, but rather that its movements aren't directly tied to the broader market.

*   **Previous Close:** 0.1710
*   **Change:** 0.96% (Slight positive change)

*   The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, which can be seen as a short-term bullish signal.
*   However, the price is below the 60-day moving average, suggesting the longer-term trend might be less positive or at least needs further observation.
