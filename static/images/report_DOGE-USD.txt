2026-01-06 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) based on the provided information:

**0. Summary of Data and Analysis**

First, let's summarize the given information:

*   **Dogecoin (DOGE-USD):** A cryptocurrency originally created as a joke.
*   **Return Comparison:** Dogecoin has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in cumulative returns, but this comes with significant volatility.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** Dogecoin exhibits high volatility (high beta) and significantly positive alpha, indicating it generates returns independent of the market but with considerable risk.
*   **Recent Price Action:** Dogecoin's recent moving averages suggest some bullish momentum (5-day SMA > 20-day SMA).
*   **Market Risk Indicator:** The MRI suggests medium investment risk.
*   **Technical Indicators:** RSI is approaching overbought territory, and PPO indicates bullish momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends a high buy percentage.
*   **News:** Recent news headlines are mixed, with price predictions, drops, and jumps reported.

**1. Return Comparison and Analysis**

*   **Cumulative Return (DOGE-USD):** 2874.84%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 72.90%
*   **Divergence:** 2801.9
*   **Relative Divergence:** 25.1

**Analysis:**

Dogecoin's cumulative return is astronomically higher than the S&P 500. The relative divergence of 25.1 indicates that the current divergence is relatively low compared to its historical range, meaning that there have been times when the divergence between Dogecoin and the S&P 500 was much higher. This extreme outperformance comes with extreme volatility and risk, as evidenced by its maximum and minimum divergence values. Simply, Dogecoin is far more volatile than the overall stock market.

**Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD  | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|------|---------|------|--------|
| 2018-2020  | -79.0% | 57.0% | -100.0% | 0.7  | 0.8    |
| 2019-2021  | 3411.0% | 70.8% | 3368.0% | 0.9  | 28.5   |
| 2020-2022  | 1798.0% | 83.6% | 1800.0% | 1.2  | 11.8   |
| 2021-2023  | 1963.0% | 83.6% | 1962.0% | 1.8  | 15.0   |
| 2022-2024  | 4779.0% | 54.8% | 4759.0% | 1.7  | 52.8   |
| 2023-2025  | -149.0% | 72.4% | -211.0% | 1.6  | 19.6   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows periods of massive gains (e.g., 3411% from 2019-2021) but also significant losses (e.g., -79% from 2018-2020). This highlights the highly speculative nature of Dogecoin.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Indicates substantial potential for loss, with drawdowns frequently exceeding 50%.  This is a critical risk factor.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently high positive alpha (except for 2018-2020 and 2023-2025) suggests Dogecoin's returns are largely independent of the broader market. This means it can generate returns even when the market is flat or down.
*   **Beta:** High Beta values (ranging from 0.7 to 1.8) indicate Dogecoin is significantly more volatile than the market. A beta of 1.8 means Dogecoin's price tends to move 80% more than the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Cap(B) suggests the market cap of beta

**Analysis:**

The recent price (0.1527) is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. The 5-day SMA being above the 20-day SMA and 60-day SMA further confirms this bullish signal.  The positive change in the last market session reinforces this momentum.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment rating suggests a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI near 70 indicates that Dogecoin is approaching overbought territory, which could signal a potential pullback or consolidation.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, confirming bullish momentum.
