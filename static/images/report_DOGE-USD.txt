## Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) Investment Review

This report analyzes the performance of Dogecoin (DOGE-USD), a cryptocurrency, against the S&P 500 (VOO) benchmark.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Dogecoin is a decentralized digital currency.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500.

* **Cumulative Return (DOGE-USD):** 4148.48%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 95.87%
* **Return Difference:** 4052.6% (This represents the difference in cumulative returns between DOGE and VOO as of the last day in the data set).
* **Relative Divergence:** 17.7% (This indicates that the current performance difference between DOGE and VOO falls at the 17.7th percentile of the historical range of differences, where the minimum difference is -45.3% and the maximum is 23063.5%).  This metric does *not* imply DOGE outperformed VOO by 17.7%, only that its current outperformance relative to historical differences lies at the 17.7th percentile.


The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and inconsistent performance.  While recent years show extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), earlier periods demonstrate significant losses.  The high Beta values (especially 2019-2021 and 2020-2022) suggest high sensitivity to market movements, particularly in those periods.  The consistently near-zero alpha values (except for the later periods) suggest that the returns are largely explained by market movements, with limited manager skill or alpha generating factors involved.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2017-2019  | -96.0%   | 49.9%    | -0.0  | 0.3   |       |
| 2018-2020  | -157.0%  | 49.9%    | -0.0  | 0.7   |       |
| 2019-2021  | 4929.0%  | 26.6%    | -0.0  | 26.4  |       |
| 2020-2022  | 1547.0%  | 36.4%    | -0.0  | 10.6  |       |
| 2021-2023  | 98.0%    | 36.4%    | 0.4   | 14.1  |       |
| 2022-2024  | 1484.0%  | 39.4%    | 0.4   | 48.8  |       |
| 2023-2025  | 1982.0%  | 39.4%    | 0.5   | 38.1  |       |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.2466
* **Last Market Price:** $0.2576
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.3177
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.3431

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend.  The recent price change shows a slight increase (0.92%) from the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 19.39 – This indicates the asset is oversold.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -3.11 – This suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.4% –  Indicates a recent short-term decline.


The provided `Last-market` data shows a slight price increase, which is relatively small and doesn't necessarily indicate a significant reversal (not a "sharp rebound").  The extremely high expected return of 10042.3% is likely based on past high-growth periods, but the extreme volatility and the fact this is a cryptocurrency make it difficult to consider this a reliable forecast for future performance, especially considering the relatively low current price and the negative momentum indicators.  Long-term investment in DOGE involves substantial risk.  While a long-term, disciplined approach could potentially yield returns exceeding the S&P 500,  the high risk associated with Dogecoin must be fully understood and accepted before any investment decision is made.
