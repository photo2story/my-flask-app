Okay, here's an analysis of DOGE-USD based on the data you provided, presented in English with a focus on key metrics and actionable insights.

**1. Performance Overview: DOGE-USD vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** DOGE-USD
*   **Company Description:** DOGE-USD represents Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency that originated as a meme.

**Key Performance Numbers:**

*   **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 5171.72%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 77.46%
*   **Spread (DOGE-USD vs. VOO):**
    *   Max Spread: 11337.3
    *   Min Spread: -39.0
    *   Current Spread: 5026.1
    *   Relative Spread Position: 44.5 (This indicates the current spread is in the lower half of its historical range, but still very significant positive difference)

**Analysis:**

Dogecoin has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. However, the "Relative Spread Position" of 44.5 suggests that while still significantly positive, the degree of outperformance isn't at its historical peak. The high volatility of DOGE-USD is evident in the large range between the maximum and minimum spread values.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -41.0%  | 77.8% | -49.0%  | 0.1  | 0.3    |
| 2018-2020  | -79.0%  | 77.8% | -103.0% | 0.0  | 0.7    |
| 2019-2021  | 3411.0% | 78.0% | 3364.0% | -0.0 | 25.4   |
| 2020-2022  | 1798.0% | 86.2% | 1799.0% | 0.0  | 10.5   |
| 2021-2023  | 1963.0% | 86.2% | 1961.0% | 0.0  | 13.3   |
| 2022-2024  | 4779.0% | 86.2% | 4758.0% | 0.0  | 47.1   |
| 2023-2025  | 2815.0% | 82.8% | 2752.0% | 0.2  | 37.8   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate fluctuates wildly, reflecting Dogecoin's volatile nature.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures indicate substantial risk of losses.
*   **Alpha:** The extremely high alpha values suggest significant outperformance relative to the market (risk-adjusted). However, this is coupled with high volatility.
*   **Beta:** Consistently low Beta values (close to 0 or negative in some periods) indicate a very weak correlation to the S&P 500. Dogecoin moves independently of the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization varies greatly, showing periods of intense growth and then significant contraction.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 0.2533
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 0.2497, Previous Close: 0.2586, Change: -3.43% (Suggests a recent downward pressure)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 0.2406
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 0.2559
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.2337

**Analysis:**

The current price is below the 20-day moving average (0.2559), suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average (0.2337), indicating it may still be within an upward trend when considering the longer time frame. The recent -3.43% change indicates immediate selling pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators and Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - *Important Note:* This MRI reading may not be ideally suited for highly speculative assets like Dogecoin. Consider it with caution.
*   **RSI:** 41.93 (Neutral, not overbought or oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.78 (Suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating potential downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" (Very Safe) - *Note:* This signal should be interpreted carefully. Given the volatility of Dogecoin, a 100% allocation might be considered aggressive for many investors.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** +2.5 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4343.9% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500) - *Highly speculative.* This projects significant outperformance but comes with substantial risk.

**Analysis:**

The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, but given Dogecoin's volatility, this should be taken with caution and is probably not suitable for risk-averse investors. The RSI is neutral. The PPO suggests a possible downtrend. The "Hybrid Signal" might be overly optimistic, and it is important to remember it's an automated signal.

The recent 20-day relative spread increase is positive, indicating recent outperformance versus the S&P 500, but the overall volatility remains a critical factor. The expected return is extremely high but comes with immense uncertainty.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

The provided news headlines are largely irrelevant to Dogecoin. They cover topics like:

*   Green Cross Health stock performance
*   Nicolas Cage's engagement ring story
*   Foley Wines dividend
*   AI protester's hunger strike
*   Texas shooting
*   San Joaquin County wine fee

**Analysis:**

*   **Lack of Relevant News:** The absence of news specifically about Dogecoin is notable. This could mean that there are no immediately pressing catalysts affecting the cryptocurrency.
*   **General Market Sentiment:** While these news stories are not directly related to Dogecoin, negative headlines (shooting) may contribute to overall market uncertainty, potentially affecting investor sentiment towards risk assets like cryptocurrencies.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   No analyst consensus data was provided.

**5. Summary and Conclusion**

Dogecoin has demonstrated remarkable historical returns compared to the S&P 500. However, this outperformance comes with extremely high volatility and risk, as evidenced by the high MDD values. Its price action suggests recent downturn, and technical signals are mixed. The AI-driven "buy" signal should be interpreted skeptically due to the speculative nature of the asset. The news headlines provided are unrelated, making a fundamental analysis difficult.

**Overall Recommendation (with strong caveats):**

Investing in Dogecoin is highly speculative and should only be considered by investors with a very high risk tolerance. The potential for substantial gains exists, but so does the risk of significant losses.

**Crucial Considerations:**

*   **Risk Tolerance:** This is paramount. Dogecoin is not a suitable investment for risk-averse individuals.
*   **Portfolio Allocation:** Any investment in Dogecoin should represent a very small percentage of your overall portfolio.
*   **Due Diligence:** Conduct thorough research and understand the underlying technology, market dynamics, and potential risks before investing.
*   **Lack of Fundamental Value:** Dogecoin's value is driven largely by sentiment and community interest, making it difficult to assess its long-term prospects using traditional financial metrics.
