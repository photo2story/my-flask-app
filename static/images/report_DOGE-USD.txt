2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) analysis based on the provided information.

**Report on Dogecoin (DOGE-USD)**

**1.  Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency featuring a Shiba Inu dog from the "Doge" Internet meme as its logo.
*   **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 2874.84%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 72.90%
*   **Divergence:** 2801.9 (Relative Divergence: 25.1)

**Analysis:**

Dogecoin has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The relative divergence of 25.1 suggests the current outperformance is closer to the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. The magnitude of the cumulative return difference highlights the highly speculative nature of Dogecoin, as traditional assets like the S&P 500 are far more stable.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| 2018-2020  | -79.0%  | 57.0%  | -100.0% | 0.7  | 0.8    |
| 2019-2021  | 3411.0% | 70.8%  | 3368.0% | 0.9  | 28.6   |
| 2020-2022  | 1798.0% | 83.6%  | 1800.0% | 1.2  | 11.8   |
| 2021-2023  | 1963.0% | 83.6%  | 1962.0% | 1.8  | 15.0   |
| 2022-2024  | 4779.0% | 54.8%  | 4759.0% | 1.7  | 52.9   |
| 2023-2025  | -149.0% | 72.4%  | -211.0% | 1.6  | 19.6   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows wildly varying performance, from massive gains to significant losses, highlighting Dogecoin's volatility.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Indicates substantial risk, with MDDs frequently exceeding 50%, showing potential for large losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:**  Generally very high (except in the 2018-2020 and 2023-2025 periods), indicating Dogecoin's returns are significantly driven by factors other than the market (S&P 500) performance.  The negative Alpha in some periods means it significantly underperformed what would be predicted by the market's movement.
*   **Beta:** Beta values range from 0.7 to 1.8. Generally indicating that Dogecoin's price moves more than the market, and so Dogecoin is relatively volatile. A beta less than 1 (as in 2018-2020) indicates that it moves less than the market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 0.1526788026094436
*   **Last Market:** Price: 0.1521245, Previous Close: 0.14306073, Change: 6.34%
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.1323
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.1283
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.144

**Analysis:**
The current price is above all Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This can be interpreted as a short-term bullish signal. The 6.34% price change between the previous close and last traded price indicates a recent upward movement.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 68.83 (Approaching overbought territory - typically above 70)
*   **PPO:** 2.56
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (58 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-04)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 4.9 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 11322.8%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk, which is relatively high.
*   The RSI value indicates the asset is nearing overbought levels, which could suggest a potential pullback is imminent.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying 90% of cash with 0% cash reserves, and the MRI indicates that the signal is relatively safe.
*   The positive recent divergence change confirms the short-term upward trend.
*   The extremely high expected return should be viewed with extreme caution, especially considering Dogecoin's volatile nature.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance):**

*   **Early 2026 Price Predictions:**  An article discussing future price predictions suggests ongoing interest and speculation around Dogecoin.
*   **Plummeting Prices (November 2025):** This news item indicates potential for rapid price declines, reinforcing Dogecoin's volatile nature.

*   **Price Jumps (September & July 2025):** News about price jumps highlights the potential for significant short-term gains.
*   **Inclusion in Treasury (July 2025):**  The inclusion of Dogecoin in Thumzup Media's treasury, alongside Bitcoin, suggests increasing (though still limited) acceptance as a potential asset.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Dogecoin is a highly volatile cryptocurrency with the potential for significant gains and losses. Its performance is driven more by speculation and external factors than by underlying fundamentals, as indicated by its high Alpha and wildly varying CAGR.  Recent positive price movement, SMA indicators, and news events have created a short-term bullish outlook. The extremely high expected return is unrealistic.
