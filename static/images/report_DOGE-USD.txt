## DOGE-USD Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

DOGE-USD is a cryptocurrency, not a company with traditional financial statements.  Therefore, traditional metrics like revenue and profit are not applicable.  This review will focus on price performance.

The provided data shows a cumulative return of 8589.7% for DOGE-USD compared to 101.84% for the S&P 500 (VOO).  The significant difference underscores the high volatility and potential for both substantial gains and losses inherent in cryptocurrency investments. The relative divergence of 8487.86 indicates DOGE-USD's performance significantly outpaces the S&P 500, though this is heavily influenced by the extreme volatility of DOGE-USD.  It's crucial to understand that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Analysis:** The table highlights the extreme volatility of DOGE-USD.  CAGR fluctuates wildly, and Alpha is significantly positive in periods of high growth, indicating outperformance relative to the market benchmark (though Beta is highly variable, showing varying degrees of market sensitivity).  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) underlines the considerable risk associated with this investment.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.38 (Last market: $0.40)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.18

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum, but below the 60-day average, indicating a longer-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (79.39):**  Indicates the asset is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (-1.11):** Shows a bearish divergence, potentially indicating weakening momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+20.11):** Suggests recent short-term upward momentum.

Given the last market price of $0.40 and current price of $0.38, there has been a slight dip, not a significant drop.   The high RSI and positive relative divergence highlight potential for short-term upward movement, although this is counteracted by the bearish PPO reading. The expected return of 439.69% over the long term is extremely high and should be viewed with extreme skepticism.  It's crucial to remember that this is a prediction, not a guaranteed outcome.
