## DOGE-USD Investment Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin meme, shows extremely high volatility and unpredictable returns.  The provided data highlights significant periods of both massive gains and substantial losses. The cumulative return vastly outperforms the S&P 500, but this is heavily influenced by periods of extreme price swings.  Further analysis is needed to determine if this outperformance is sustainable.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 3440.92%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 93.72%
* **Return Difference:** 3347.2%

The cumulative return of DOGE-USD significantly outperforms the S&P 500. However, the provided relative divergence (14.7%) indicates that while currently high, this outperformance isn't at its historical peak. The extremely high maximum relative divergence (23063.5%) shows that DOGE-USD has experienced periods of far greater outperformance in the past.  The volatility is a critical factor to consider.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The alpha and beta values highlight DOGE-USD's high volatility and lack of consistent correlation with the market.  The significantly high beta values (especially 2019-2021) indicate extreme sensitivity to market movements during certain periods, while the near-zero alpha suggests little consistent outperformance independent of market trends.  The fluctuating Beta emphasizes that its market relationship is unpredictable.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|-------|

| 2018-2020  | -157.0%  | 49.9%    | -0.0  | 0.6   |       |
| 2019-2021  | 4929.0%  | 26.6%    | -0.0  | 23.1  |       |
| 2020-2022  | 1547.0%  | 36.4%    | -0.0  | 9.3   |       |
| 2021-2023  | 98.0%    | 36.4%    | 0.4   | 12.3  |       |
| 2022-2024  | 1484.0%  | 39.4%    | 0.4   | 42.8  |       |
| 2023-2025  | 1274.0%  | 39.4%    | 0.5   | 27.9  |       |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Closing Price:** $0.2055
* **Last Market Price:** $0.1878
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.2236
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.2485
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.3086

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend. The recent price drop (-9.18%) is a significant factor to consider, indicating a negative short-term momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 21.91 (Indicates oversold conditions, potentially suggesting a bounce but not guaranteeing it)
* **PPO:** -1.28 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.6% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** 12359.5% (This extremely high expected return needs significant scrutiny.  It's likely based on highly volatile past performance and may not be realistic for future long-term performance.)

The provided data shows a sharp price drop recently (-9.18%). This should be considered a potentially significant event and influences the interpretation of the indicators.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and recent price drop indicate continued downward pressure.


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has shown extraordinary returns in the past, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this has been accompanied by extreme volatility and periods of massive losses.  The current situation, with the price below moving averages, negative technical indicators, and a recent sharp drop, presents a high-risk scenario.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return should be treated with extreme caution.  Any investment decision should be made after thorough due diligence and careful consideration of risk tolerance, given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.
