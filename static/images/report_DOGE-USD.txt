## DOGE-USD Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) shows exceptionally high cumulative returns (4090.09%) significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with 75.48% cumulative return. However, this performance is highly volatile, as evidenced by large swings in its CAGR, MDD, and beta. Current price action suggests a potential short-term overbought condition (RSI > 65), but long-term expected returns remain significantly higher than the S&P 500.  Further investigation is needed to mitigate significant risks associated with high volatility.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

DOGE-USD is a cryptocurrency and a meme-based internet phenomenon.  Its cumulative return vastly exceeds that of the S&P 500 (VOO), a difference of approximately 4014.6 percentage points.  This places its current relative divergence at the 90th percentile of historical data (using min/max scaling).  Note that the high relative divergence does not guarantee future outperformance, just that historically, the performance has been in the top 10% of what was observed from the given data. The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and periods of extreme returns. High Beta values (exceeding 8.9 in some periods) indicate significant sensitivity to market movements.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -39.0%    | 45.2%    | -51.0% | 0.0   |     |
| 2018-2020  | -56.0%    | 45.2%    | -90.0% | 0.0   |     |

| 2020-2022  | 1802.0%  | 51.0%    | 1791.0% | 0.0   |     |
| 2021-2023  | 223.0%   | 51.0%    | 205.0%  | 0.4   |     |
| 2022-2024  | 2922.0%  | 69.7%    | 2899.0% | 0.3   |     |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** 0.19049
* **Last Market Close:** 0.16636
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 0.1863
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 0.1743
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.2263

The price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend, but a possible longer-term bearish trend.  The very slight negative change in the `Last-market` data does not indicate a significant price movement event.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 65.397 (Overbought territory â€“ suggests potential short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 2.9409 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 1.9 (+) (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 12237.8% (This exceptionally high value likely reflects the historical volatility and extreme returns experienced by DOGE-USD. It is crucial to treat such projections with extreme caution, due to the inherently unpredictable nature of the asset.)

The high RSI and the relatively low MRI suggest a potentially overbought condition in the short-term.  The extremely high expected return should be interpreted cautiously; while it indicates a possible outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, the high volatility inherently associated with Dogecoin makes this prediction highly uncertain.

**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD exhibits an exceptionally high return compared to the S&P 500, but carries substantial risk due to its high volatility.  While the long-term expected return is attractive, investors must carefully consider the high risk profile before investing. The current technical indicators suggest a possible short-term correction, and extreme caution is advised when using the reported expected return as a primary decision-making factor.  Further due diligence is needed to justify investment.
