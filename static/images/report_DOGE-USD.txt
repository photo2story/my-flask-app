**1. Company Overview and Performance Analysis:**

DOGE-USD, or Dogecoin, is a cryptocurrency.  Its performance has vastly outpaced the S&P 500, with a cumulative return significantly higher than that of the VOO. The provided data show significant volatility, with periods of both extreme gains and losses.  The large swings are highlighted by the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values in the table. Note that while the relative divergence suggests strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, this does not guarantee future performance.  The high Beta values, particularly in 2019-2021, indicate high sensitivity to market movements.  Alpha values close to zero suggest that the returns aren't consistently outperforming a market benchmark after adjusting for risk.  However, the recent positive alpha could suggest a shift.


**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

The table shows highly volatile CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values, reflecting Dogecoin's extreme price swings.  The negative CAGR values in earlier periods highlight substantial losses. The significantly high Beta values indicate significant market sensitivity.  The recent positive Alphas suggest that, in those periods, Dogecoin outperformed the market, but the historically low and sometimes negative alphas need further consideration.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2017-2019  | -96.0%   | 49.9% | -113.0% | -0.0 | 0.3 |
| 2018-2020  | -157.0%  | 49.9% | -185.0% | -0.0 | 0.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 4929.0% | 26.6% | 4858.0% | -0.0 | 25.8 |
| 2020-2022  | 1547.0% | 36.4% | 1538.0% | -0.0 | 10.4 |
| 2021-2023  | 98.0%    | 36.4% | 74.0% | 0.4 | 13.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 1484.0% | 39.4% | 1451.0% | 0.4 | 47.8 |
| 2023-2025  | 2418.0% | 39.4% | 2355.0% | 0.5 | 41.2 |



**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.2719
* **Last Market Price:** $0.2783 (Slight increase from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $0.2614
* **20-day Moving Average:** $0.2829
* **60-day Moving Average:** $0.3261

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible bearish trend.  However, the recent price increase (2.33%) indicates a potential short-term upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (32.02):** Suggests the asset is potentially oversold, implying a possible bounce.  However, RSI should be interpreted cautiously for volatile assets like cryptocurrencies.
* **PPO (0.25):** A positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+1.9):**  Indicates a recent short-term price increase, consistent with the last market price.
* **Expected Return (8726.9%):** This is a projected long-term return significantly exceeding that of the S&P 500, but this projection is highly speculative given the inherent volatility of Dogecoin.  The prediction should be treated cautiously and not as investment advice.


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has demonstrated exceptionally high volatility and returns that significantly exceed the S&P 500's performance over certain periods.  However, its extreme volatility, historically high Beta, and periods of significant losses make it a very high-risk investment.  The current technical indicators suggest potential short-term upward movement, but this is not a guarantee.  Long-term investment requires careful consideration of the extreme risks involved.
