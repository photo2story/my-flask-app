## DOGE-USD Analysis

**Company Overview:** DOGE-USD is a cryptocurrency, originally created as a joke based on the "Doge" internet meme, but later gained a passionate community and significant market capitalization.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 4738.75%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 77.29%
*   **Absolute Divergence (Current):** 4662.2
*   **Divergence Range:** Max: 11337.3, Min: -39.0
*   **Relative Divergence (Current):** 41.3

**Analysis:** DOGE-USD has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. The current divergence of 4662.2 represents a significantly positive difference in cumulative returns. However, the relative divergence of 41.3 suggests that the current divergence is positioned relatively lower within the historical range of divergence between DOGE-USD and VOO, indicating it's not at its peak outperformance compared to historical fluctuations.

**2. Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| 2019-2021  | 3429.0% | 78.0% | 3383.0% | -0.0 | 28.0   |
| 2020-2022  | 1808.0% | 86.2% | 1809.0% | -0.0 | 11.5   |

| 2023-2025  | 2369.0% | 82.8% | 2306.0% | 0.2  | 37.6   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  CAGR is highly volatile, with significant negative values in early periods and massive positive values in later periods. This highlights the speculative nature of DOGE-USD.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  The high Alpha values suggest that DOGE-USD's performance is largely independent of the market (S&P 500) movements.  It's generating returns (both positive and negative) that are not explained by broad market trends.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are very low, closer to 0, implying minimal correlation with the S&P 500. In later years it goes up a little bit.
*   **Cap(B):** Cap(B) shows the hypothetical portfolio size in Billions, with a considerable rise in 2022-2024.

**3. Recent Price Action & Moving Averages:**

*   **Current Price:** 0.2289
*   **Last Market:** `{'price': 0.24864432, 'previousClose': 0.24846193, 'change': 0.07}`
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 0.2328
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 0.2556
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 0.2325

**Analysis:** The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent downward trend. The `Last Market` data indicates a small price increase compared to the previous close, a positive signal that may indicate the beginning of a rebound.

**4. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 32.24 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.995 (Negative, suggesting a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4356 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +1.1 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 4905% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the high volatility, the MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" rating. This seems contradictory and warrants further scrutiny – it's crucial to understand the model behind the MRI and its limitations, especially for highly speculative assets like DOGE-USD.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity if you believe in a price reversal.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO value confirms the recent downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The `Buy` signal should be viewed with caution, especially given the other indicators and volatility.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a potential short-term recovery in DOGE-USD's performance compared to VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism.  It represents a highly optimistic, long-term projection and doesn't guarantee actual results.

**5. Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance):**

*   **[2025-10-02] JD Vance Warns Government Shutdown:**  Generally negative for markets, but the "Buy The Dip" sentiment might offer short-term support.
*   **[2025-10-02] Hanwha Life Launches Finance Mentor Program in Vietnam:** Irrelevant to DOGE-USD.
*   **[2025-10-02] Rising wildfires spur comeback for Canadian water bomber:**  Irrelevant to DOGE-USD.
*   **[2025-10-02] Bonvests Holdings shareholders have earned a 4.4% CAGR:** Irrelevant to DOGE-USD.
*   **[2025-10-02] Dow Jones Futures: Stock Market Hits Highs:**  Positive market sentiment could provide some tailwind for DOGE-USD, but its correlation to the overall market is weak.
*   **[2025-10-02] /C O R R E C T I O N -- SECONDSENSE/:** Irrelevant to DOGE-USD.

**Analysis of News:** The news headlines are generally unrelated to DOGE-USD directly.  The most relevant is the Dow Jones Futures hitting highs, which suggests positive general market sentiment, which *might* indirectly benefit DOGE-USD. The warning of a government shutdown is a potential negative factor for the overall market and, by extension, could negatively impact DOGE-USD as well.

**6. 종합 / Overall Assessment:**

DOGE-USD is a highly speculative asset with extreme volatility and returns largely independent of the broader market.  While it has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, past performance is not indicative of future results.

*   **Technical Indicators:** Indicators are mixed, with the RSI approaching oversold territory while the PPO confirms a recent downtrend. The MRI's "High Investment Recommended" rating seems questionable and requires deeper investigation.
*   **News Impact:** News provides little relevant direction.
*   **Risk:**  DOGE-USD carries a very high risk due to its volatile nature, limited real-world utility, and dependence on social media sentiment.

**Recommendation:**

Investing in DOGE-USD should be approached with extreme caution.  It's suitable only for investors with a very high risk tolerance and a clear understanding of the potential for significant losses.  The provided "Buy" signal and expected return should be heavily discounted. If considering an investment, only allocate a very small percentage of your portfolio that you are prepared to lose entirely. Thoroughly research the underlying technology, community sentiment, and potential regulatory risks before making any decisions.
