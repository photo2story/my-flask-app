## DOGE-USD Stock Report

This report analyzes DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin digital currency.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

DOGE-USD has exhibited significantly higher cumulative returns (3370.78%) compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 29.21% as of the last data point. This represents a substantial divergence of 3341.6 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 23.2% indicates that DOGE-USD's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, although this doesn't imply future outperformance.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals highly volatile performance across different periods.  While CAGR shows extremely high returns in several years (3254%, 1530%, 960%, 4217%, 1319%),  the Beta values fluctuate wildly, suggesting significant sensitivity to market movements, especially in the periods 2019-2021 and 2022-2024. The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) further underscores the substantial risk associated with investing in DOGE-USD.  Alpha values generally stay positive although small, suggesting some degree of outperformance compared to the benchmark after accounting for risk. However, this is likely due to the high volatility and therefore should be treated with caution.  Note that the high beta values suggest that the performance of DOGE-USD is heavily influenced by market conditions rather than its own specific fundamentals.  The capitalisation is not consistently reported.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.1495
* **Last Market Price:** $0.1448 (a -3.15% change from the previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $0.1601
* **20-day Moving Average:** $0.1717
* **60-day Moving Average:** $0.2022

The price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent price drop of -3.15% signals a short-term decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)  The MRI indicates a high-risk environment.
* **RSI:** 31.89 (Oversold territory) A RSI below 30 usually indicates that the asset is oversold.
* **PPO:** -0.61 (Bearish) A negative PPO suggests a bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 6544.1% (Long-term, 2+ years, relative to S&P 500)  This exceptionally high figure should be treated with extreme caution.  Given the high volatility and uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, such a projection is highly speculative and unrealistic.

**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has historically shown extremely high returns, but this comes with extremely high volatility and risk as evidenced by the high beta and MDD values. Current indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend. The extremely high projected long-term return should be viewed with extreme skepticism due to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market.  Any investment decision should be made after thorough due diligence and a comprehensive understanding of the risks involved.  The historical high returns do not guarantee future performance.
