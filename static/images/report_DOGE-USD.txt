**1. Performance Analysis:**

The table below shows a significant outperformance of DOGE-USD compared to the S&P 500 (represented by VOO) over various periods.  Noteworthy is the extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in several periods, particularly from 2019-2021 and 2020-2022. However, this is accompanied by high maximum drawdown (MDD), indicating substantial volatility.  The alpha values suggest periods of outperformance relative to the market (though beta values reflect periods of extremely high volatility and market sensitivity.) Capitalization (Cap) fluctuates dramatically.

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2018-2020  | -23.0%     | 72.7% | -53.0% | 0.0   | 0.7    |
| 2019-2021  | 3254.0%   | 63.1% | 3206.0%| 0.1   | 24.4   |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.181577
* **Last Market Price:** $0.174061
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.1777
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.1693
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.1714

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend.  However, it sits above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential support levels. The recent price change of -0.96% reflects a small dip.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 74.32 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.94 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 5137.7% (This is a very high expected return compared to the S&P 500, but it's crucial to acknowledge the extreme volatility inherent in Dogecoin.)

The high RSI value and negative relative divergence suggest potential short-term price weakness. However, the positive PPO and overall high long-term expected return, although highly uncertain, indicates potential for long-term growth.  The large expected return is, however, based on past performance which is not indicative of future results.  The extremely high volatility and inherent risk of Dogecoin should be carefully considered.  Any investment decision should be based on a thorough risk assessment and understanding of the underlying asset.
