## Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) is a cryptocurrency featuring a Shiba Inu dog meme as its logo.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO), although volatility is extremely high.  Recent price action shows a short-term upward trend, but the high RSI suggests potential overbought conditions. Long-term expected returns are exceptionally high compared to the S&P 500, but this is based on highly volatile historical data.


**1. Performance Analysis:**

Dogecoin has shown remarkable returns compared to the S&P 500.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 4614.76% for DOGE-USD versus 51.53% for VOO. This represents a substantial divergence. The relative divergence, considering historical fluctuations, is 31.6%, implying the current outperformance is near the higher end of the historical range. However, historical data shows extreme volatility with high maximum drawdown (MDD) values. Alpha and Beta values fluctuate significantly across periods indicating a high degree of risk and lack of consistent correlation with the market. Note that the provided Alpha and Beta figures are likely unreliable and require a more robust methodology of calculation based on risk-adjusted returns and statistical significance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is 0.2053.  The last market price shows a recent decrease of 5.69% from the previous close (0.2349 vs 0.2491).  Moving averages suggest a short-term upward trend:

* 5-day moving average: 0.1835
* 20-day moving average: 0.1775
* 60-day moving average: 0.1705


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3707 (Medium Risk)  This suggests a moderately risky investment.

* **RSI:** 68.09 –  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70). This suggests a potential pullback.

* **PPO:** 1.3641 – A positive value indicating upward momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 3.8 (+), indicating a short-term upward trend.  The significant negative change in the `Last-market` data (-5.69%) suggests a recent price drop, counter to the positive delta. This could indicate a short-term correction within the upward trend.

* **Expected Return:** 4283.9% – This extremely high expected return compared to the S&P 500 is based on historical performance which is highly volatile and might not be sustainable in the future.  This forecast should be treated with extreme caution.  Any investment decision should consider the significant risks involved.  A more robust approach would model expected returns considering factors beyond historical returns.


**Conclusion:**

Dogecoin's past performance has been exceptionally strong relative to the S&P 500, but this has been accompanied by extremely high volatility and periods of significant negative returns.  Current indicators suggest a short-term upward trend, but overbought conditions and recent price action call for caution. The exceptionally high projected long-term return must be viewed with substantial skepticism due to the inherent risk and volatility of the asset.  Thorough due diligence and risk assessment are crucial before investing in Dogecoin.
