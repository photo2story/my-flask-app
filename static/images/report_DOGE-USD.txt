**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

DOGE-USD is a cryptocurrency, not a company with traditional financial statements.  Therefore, conventional financial metrics like revenue and earnings are not applicable.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 8589.7% for DOGE-USD, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 101.84%. The difference in cumulative returns is a staggering 8487.86%. The relative divergence of 31.47% indicates that the current performance relative to historical performance against the S&P 500 is in the upper range.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B)  |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| 2017-2019  | 43.3%    | 82.0%    | -8.4%   | 0.8     |         |
| 2018-2020  | -48.8%   | 82.0%    | -96.2%  | 0.8     |         |
| 2019-2021  | 6983.3%  | 77.0%    | 6883.3% | 0.9     |         |
| 2020-2022  | 3304.9%  | 92.1%    | 3281.3% | 1.3     |         |
| 2021-2023  | 832.1%   | 92.1%    | 797.1%  | 2.0     |         |
| 2022-2024  | 126.2%   | 70.6%    | 96.6%   | 1.7     |         |

**Note:**  The high Beta values (especially in 2019-2021 and 2021-2023) suggest high volatility and significant correlation to the overall market, though this correlation is seemingly broken in periods of extreme price movements. The Alpha values indicate significant outperformance of the market during certain periods, though again, these metrics may not be entirely reliable for cryptocurrencies.  The missing Cap(B) data highlights the difficulty in applying traditional market cap valuations to cryptocurrencies.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.38 (Last Market: $0.40)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.18

The price is currently above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (79.39):**  Indicates the asset is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term pullback.
* **PPO (-1.11):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum, possibly contradicting the RSI and price action. This discrepancy highlights the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+20.11):** Shows a significant positive change in relative strength over the last 20 days, confirming the short-term uptrend.  A rapid price movement (as suggested by the higher closing price) could be influencing these short-term technicals.
* **Expected Return (439.69%):**  This exceptionally high projected return is likely based on past volatility and should be viewed with extreme caution.  It does *not* guarantee future performance, especially given the high risk inherent in Dogecoin's price swings.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

**No earnings data available.**  As DOGE-USD is a cryptocurrency, it does not have traditional earnings reports or financial statements.  Traditional financial analysis methods are not applicable.

**6. Financial Information:**

**No 'Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit' data available.** Again, traditional financial reporting is not applicable to DOGE-USD.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific earnings news for DOGE-USD was found in readily available sources within the past two days.  General market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies and the overall economic climate significantly influence DOGE-USD's price.  Recent news articles on general cryptocurrency market trends (from sources like Finbold) should be consulted for up-to-date information.  Analyst opinions are highly variable and often contradictory due to the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

DOGE-USD shows extremely high volatility and massive past returns. However, its price movements are primarily driven by speculation and market sentiment rather than fundamental financial data. The high RSI and positive relative divergence suggest a short-term uptrend, but the negative PPO and overbought conditions warn of potential short-term corrections. The projected long-term return is exceptionally high and should not be considered a reliable prediction.  Investing in DOGE-USD carries significant risk, and any investment decision should be based on a thorough understanding of this risk and a tolerance for significant potential losses.
