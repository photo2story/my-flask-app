## DOGE-USD Investment Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin meme, shows exceptionally high cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500 (VOO). However,  high volatility and negative alpha in several periods raise significant concerns.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 4702.28%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 94.86%
* **Return Difference:** 4607.42%  This highlights the substantial outperformance of DOGE-USD, but this is misleading without considering the risk.  The relative divergence indicates DOGE-USD's performance is in the 20.1st percentile of its historical range relative to the VOO, suggesting a relatively low position within its historical volatility context compared to its extreme returns.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values highlight substantial volatility and periods of significant underperformance relative to the market.  While recent years show positive alpha, the large negative alphas in earlier periods and the high beta demonstrate substantial market risk. The fluctuating market capitalization also points to a highly speculative asset.

|------------|----------|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -96.0%   | 49.9%    | -113.0% | -0.0  |       |
| 2018-2020  | -157.0%  | 49.9%    | -185.0% | -0.0  |       |
| 2019-2021  | 4929.0%  | 26.6%    | 4858.0% | -0.0  |       |
| 2020-2022  | 1547.0%  | 36.4%    | 1538.0% | -0.0  |       |
| 2021-2023  | 98.0%    | 36.4%    | 74.0%   | 0.4   |       |
| 2022-2024  | 1484.0%  | 39.4%    | 1451.0% | 0.4   |       |
| 2023-2025  | 2535.0%  | 39.4%    | 2477.0% | 0.5   |       |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.2787
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.303
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.3453
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.3556

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change of 4.17% shows a minor upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 26.77 (Suggests oversold conditions, but in a highly volatile asset like DOGE-USD, this may not hold significant weight)
* **PPO:** -2.51 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.4% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 8600.6% (This exceptionally high figure needs to be viewed with extreme caution given the volatility and speculative nature of DOGE-USD.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.)


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has demonstrated extraordinary returns in certain periods, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this performance is accompanied by extremely high volatility, substantial periods of negative alpha, and a high beta. The current price is below key moving averages, and technical indicators suggest bearish momentum.  While the projected long-term return is high, the inherent risk associated with DOGE-USD mandates extreme caution.  Investment decisions should consider a highly diversified portfolio and a thorough risk assessment, recognizing that the substantial upside potential is balanced by equally substantial downside risk.  The 8600.6% expected return should not be considered a reliable prediction.
