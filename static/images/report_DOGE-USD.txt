*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant risk and potential for substantial losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting DOGE-USD has significantly outperformed its benchmark.  The alpha values are also highly volatile, mirroring the CAGR.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values are generally low (below 0.3), suggesting DOGE-USD's returns are relatively independent of the S&P 500 index (market). However, the 2019-2021 period stands out with an unusually high beta of 25.6.

**Summary:**

DOGE-USD has demonstrated periods of exceptional growth, but also carries very high risk, indicated by the high MDD and volatile CAGR.

*   The recent positive change in relative divergence suggests short-term upward momentum against the S&P 500.
*   The very high **Expected Return** indicates significant potential upside over the long term, but should be viewed as speculative due to the high volatility and meme-driven nature of DOGE-USD. The negative price change is reflecting issue that is happening now.

### 5. Overall Analysis

DOGE-USD presents a highly speculative investment opportunity with the potential for significant returns, but also substantial risk.  Its historical performance shows periods of explosive growth, but also significant drawdowns.  The low beta suggests it's not strongly correlated with the broader market, which can be both a benefit and a risk.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **High Volatility:** DOGE-USD is prone to extreme price swings, making it unsuitable for risk-averse investors. The recent -5.57% price change and high MDD underscore this risk.
*   **Meme-Driven Nature:** A significant portion of DOGE-USD's value is driven by social media trends and online sentiment, making it difficult to predict its long-term performance based on traditional financial metrics.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** The low MRI contradicts the inherent volatility of DOGE-USD, suggesting caution when relying solely on this indicator.
*   **News Monitoring:**  Given the recent news events, actively monitoring news and company announcements is crucial for making informed investment decisions.

**Recommendation:**

Investing in DOGE-USD should be approached with extreme caution.  Due to its high volatility and speculative nature, it's suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a deep understanding of the cryptocurrency market. Consider allocating a small portion of your portfolio to DOGE-USD, and be prepared for significant losses. The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, but with caution, reinforcing the need for careful monitoring and risk management.
