## DOGE-USD Investment Report

**Executive Summary:** DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency, shows extremely volatile performance with significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 (VOO) in certain periods, but also substantial periods of massive losses. Current indicators suggest a potentially undervalued asset, but extreme risk is inherent.


**1. Performance Analysis:**

DOGE-USD is a cryptocurrency, a decentralized digital currency.  The cumulative return of DOGE-USD is 2651.11%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 82.37% cumulative return. The difference is substantial (2568.7 percentage points). The relative divergence (11.7) indicates that its current performance is relatively low compared to its historical volatility range.

The provided CAGR data shows extreme volatility.  While periods of massive gains exist (e.g., 4767.0% from 2019-2021), equally massive losses are present (-89.0% from 2018-2020).  Beta values fluctuate dramatically, indicating high sensitivity to market conditions, especially during periods of high growth.  The generally low alpha values suggest that performance isn't consistently outperforming the market after considering its beta.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B)  |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| 2017-2019  | -51.0%   | 48.2%   | -67.0%  | 0.0     |         |
| 2018-2020  | -89.0%   | 48.2%   | -116.0% | -0.0    |         |
| 2019-2021  | 4767.0%  | 26.6%   | 4696.0% | 25.9    |         |
| 2020-2022  | 1499.0%  | 36.4%   | 1490.0% | 10.4    |         |
| 2021-2023  | 95.0%    | 36.4%   | 72.0%   | 0.4     |         |
| 2022-2024  | 1420.0%  | 39.4%   | 1387.0% | 0.4     |         |
| 2023-2025  | 559.0%   | 39.4%   | 513.0%  | 0.5     |         |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.167
* **5-day Moving Average:** $0.171
* **20-day Moving Average:** $0.182
* **60-day Moving Average:** $0.244

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible bearish trend.  The recent price change of 2.09% indicates a minor upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.13 (Below 50, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.98 (Positive, but interpretation requires further context)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.4 (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** 15256.0% (Extremely high; this figure likely requires clarification on its calculation and assumptions).  This extremely high projected return needs substantial scrutiny.  It's crucial to understand the underlying assumptions and potential risks.  A 15,000%+ return expectation over the long term is highly improbable and potentially misleading without more detailed context.

The combination of an oversold RSI and a negative relative divergence suggests potential for a short-term price increase. However,  the high risk indicated by the MRI, the volatility shown in the historical data, and the extremely high expected return warrant caution.


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.  While its past performance has vastly outpaced the S&P 500 in certain periods, the extreme volatility and inherent risks associated with cryptocurrencies must be considered. The relatively low RSI and negative relative divergence could signal a short-term rebound; however,  long-term investment decisions should be based on a thorough understanding of the cryptocurrency market and risk tolerance.  The provided "Expected Return" requires significant clarification and is, in its current form, unreliable for investment decisions.  Further analysis, including deeper technical indicator study and risk assessment, is crucial before any investment decision.
