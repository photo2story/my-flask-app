## DOGE-USD Investment Review

**1. Performance Overview:**

DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin meme, has demonstrated significant price volatility.  The cumulative return of DOGE-USD is 7575.49%, vastly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 99.59%. The difference in returns is 7475.9%, placing it at the 32.5th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  However, this massive outperformance is highly influenced by periods of extreme volatility, as evidenced by the significantly negative CAGR figures in some periods presented in the table below.  Note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -96.0%    | 49.9%  | -0.0  | 0.0   |        |
| 2018-2020  | -157.0%   | 49.9%  | -0.0  | 1.0   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 4929.0%   | 26.6%  | -0.0  | 26.0  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 1547.0%   | 36.4%  | -0.0  | 11.0  |        |
| 2021-2023  | 98.0%     | 36.4%  | -0.0  | 14.0  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 3598.0%   | 39.4%  | -0.0  | 67.0  |        |


The high beta values reflect DOGE-USD's extreme sensitivity to market movements, particularly during periods of significant price appreciation.  The near-zero alpha suggests it doesn't consistently outperform the market after adjusting for risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 0.4357
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 0.4262
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 0.4085
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.2584

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, the significant gap between the 60-day and shorter-term averages indicates considerable price volatility.  The last market price of 0.46 suggests a recent small dip.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 56.25 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -2.51 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +0.3 (Indicates a short-term upward trend)

The conflicting signals from the RSI and PPO suggest caution.  While the recent relative strength change is positive, the negative PPO hints at potential weakness.


**4. Expected Return and Volatility:**

The expected return of 6266.6% is based on past performance and is highly unreliable for future predictions.  The extremely high volatility makes any long-term projection highly speculative.  This expected return is in comparison to the S&P 500 and is only a projection.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

DOGE-USD has exhibited extraordinary price volatility and returns, vastly outperforming the S&P 500 in the past. However, this performance has been extremely uneven, with periods of massive losses. The high beta signifies significant risk. Current technical indicators offer mixed signals.  Before investing, a thorough review of current market trends, regulatory risks, and technological developments is critical.  The projected long-term returns are highly speculative and should not be the sole basis for an investment decision.  Due to its high volatility, DOGE-USD is unsuitable for risk-averse investors.  Remember that cryptocurrencies are highly speculative assets.
