## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin meme, exhibits extremely volatile performance with significant divergence from the S&P 500 (VOO). While historical returns have been exceptionally high in certain periods, the high risk is evident in substantial maximum drawdowns (MDDs) and a high beta. Current indicators suggest moderate risk, but the asset's long-term prospects remain uncertain and heavily dependent on market sentiment and speculative activity.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

**Company Overview:** DOGE-USD is a decentralized digital currency, primarily driven by community sentiment and social media trends, lacking intrinsic value tied to a company's fundamentals.


**Cumulative Return Comparison:**

* DOGE-USD Cumulative Return: 3929.84%
* VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 48.68%
* **Difference:** 3881.16%

This stark difference highlights the significant outperformance of DOGE-USD compared to the S&P 500. However, this should be viewed in the context of the extremely volatile nature of the asset.  The relative divergence indicator (25.6) suggests its current position is relatively high compared to its historical range but this does not imply sustainability.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -26.0%   | 75.6%    | -41.0% | 0.0   |        |
| 2018-2020  | -14.0%   | 75.6%    | -43.0% | 0.0   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 3416.0%  | 63.1%    | 0.1   | 25.4  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 1654.0%  | 74.4%    | 0.2   | 10.2  |        |
| 2021-2023  | 940.0%   | 74.4%    | 0.5   | 13.5  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 4186.0%  | 81.0%    | 0.4   | 47.0  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 1708.0%  | 81.0%    | 0.3   | 25.4  |        |

The high and fluctuating beta values (especially 25.4 and 47.0) underscore the extreme volatility and sensitivity of DOGE-USD to broader market movements.  The positive alpha values in later years indicate periods of outperformance relative to the market, but this is inconsistent and unreliable.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $0.1711
* 5-Day Moving Average: $0.1676
* 20-Day Moving Average: $0.1739
* 60-Day Moving Average: $0.2073

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend. The 5-day moving average is also below the 20-day and 60-day averages, indicating a downward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.475 (High Risk)  The MRI suggests a high level of risk associated with the asset.

* **RSI:** 52.37 (Slightly above neutral)  The RSI is near the neutral level, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.

* **PPO:** 0.40 (Positive) A positive PPO suggests potential upward momentum.

* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -1.6 (Short-term downward trend)

* **Price Change:** 5.57% increase from the previous close. This represents a noticeable, but not extreme, daily price jump.  It's not a sharp, sudden spike that would be categorized as a 'rapid rebound.'

* **Expected Return:** 5886.7% This extremely high expected return is likely an outlier reflecting the extreme volatility and past speculative behavior of DOGE-USD and should be treated with extreme caution.  It's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, especially with such a highly volatile asset.

**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has shown periods of extraordinary returns, far exceeding the S&P 500. However, this comes with exceptionally high risk, as evidenced by the high beta, significant MDDs, and high market risk indicator. While current technical indicators show mixed signals, the extreme volatility and lack of fundamental value warrant caution.  Any investment decision should account for this substantial risk and should not solely rely on the high potential returns presented.  Long-term investment requires extreme risk tolerance.
