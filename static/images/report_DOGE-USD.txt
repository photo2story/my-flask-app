## DOGE-USD Investment Report

**1. Performance Overview and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO)**

DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin meme, shows a cumulative return of 7575.49% since its inception.  This is significantly higher than the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 99.10%. The difference in cumulative returns between DOGE-USD and VOO on the last day of the data is 7476.4%. This large difference is reflected in the high relative divergence of 32.5% (relative to the historical range of divergence).  However,  it's crucial to remember that this extreme performance is not indicative of consistent, stable returns.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided Alpha and Beta values indicate a highly volatile asset with low or negative correlations to the market (S&P 500) during several periods.  The high beta values in some periods suggest periods of extremely high sensitivity to broader market movements.  The negative alphas highlight periods of underperformance against the benchmark.

**6. Summary:**

DOGE-USD has exhibited exceptionally high volatility and returns in the past.  While past performance is not indicative of future results, the current price action shows a short-term bullish trend.  However, the negative PPO and high historical volatility suggest caution. The extremely high projected long-term return is unrealistic.  A thorough understanding of the current market conditions, regulatory environment, and technological developments is crucial before considering any investment in DOGE-USD.  Given its speculative nature and high risk, investing should only be done with a small portion of your portfolio that you can afford to lose.  The absence of fundamental value makes it particularly susceptible to market sentiment swings.  Always conduct your own thorough research before making any investment decisions.
