## Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) Report

**0. Executive Summary:** Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency.  While exhibiting periods of extreme volatility and high growth, its long-term performance relative to the S&P 500 is highly uncertain and characterized by significant drawdowns.


**1. Performance Analysis:**

Dogecoin has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) based on cumulative returns.  The cumulative return for DOGE-USD is 5541.52%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 97.33%. This represents a substantial divergence. The relative divergence (based on the provided min/max range) is 23.8%, indicating its current position is relatively high compared to its historical range of performance against the S&P 500.  However, this high relative divergence should be interpreted cautiously given the highly volatile nature of Dogecoin.

The provided CAGR data shows wildly fluctuating returns, highlighting the extreme risk involved in investing in Dogecoin.  Alpha values are consistently low or near zero, suggesting it doesn't consistently outperform the market after accounting for its risk (Beta).  High Beta values (especially in 2019-2021) indicate high sensitivity to market movements.  The recent high CAGR figures are likely to reflect periods of speculative bubbles and should not be taken as indicative of future performance.  The market cap, while fluctuating significantly, showcases its increasing market presence (though still considerably smaller than the market represented by the S&P 500).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.323864
* **Last Market Price:** $0.3378
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.3334
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.3548
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.3660

The price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The last market price shows a recent small price increase (1.89%), which is not significant enough to consider a 'rapid rebound'.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (33.71):**  Suggests the asset is currently in oversold territory.  However, given Dogecoin's volatility, this indicator should be interpreted with caution.
* **PPO (-1.51):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence (-2.9):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (6913.9%):**  This exceptionally high expected return is likely unrealistic and is heavily dependent on repeating past speculative bubbles.   Such high projected returns should be treated with extreme skepticism.  The considerable uncertainty of Dogecoin's future performance makes this long-term S&P 500 outperformance projection highly improbable.

**Conclusion:**

Dogecoin has shown periods of extraordinary growth, far surpassing the S&P 500.  However, this growth has been characterized by extreme volatility and substantial drawdowns. The high expected return and high relative divergence, considering the historical data provided, are not reliable indicators of future performance.  Investors should be fully aware of the substantial risks involved before considering investing in Dogecoin. The high beta values consistently demonstrate a highly volatile asset sensitive to market fluctuations, and the lack of significant alpha indicates no consistent ability to beat the market risk-adjusted.  Any investment decision should be based on a thorough understanding of cryptocurrency risks and a diversified investment strategy.
