**Analysis of Alpha, Beta Table:**

*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility associated with DOGE-USD.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values largely mirror the CAGR, showing very strong outperformance (positive Alpha) during periods of high growth and significant underperformance (negative Alpha) during periods of losses relative to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally low, especially considering the extreme volatility and returns.  This suggests that DOGE-USD's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). The rise in Beta over time suggests market correlation has increased.

### 5. Comprehensive Analysis & Conclusion

DOGE-USD has demonstrated tremendous historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but also exhibits extremely high volatility and risk, as indicated by its high MDD and fluctuating CAGR. While the MRI suggests a low-risk environment, the cautious Hybrid Signal (selling recommendation) points to short-term concerns and the recent price decline further reinforces this. The negative trend, as indicated by the PPO and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence, suggests potential further short-term downside. The expected return remains exceptionally high, but it is crucial to consider this within the context of DOGE-USD's volatile nature and the inherent risks of cryptocurrency investments. The news highlights ongoing volatility and sensitivity to various market and regulatory events.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted. The "cash_70%_Sell" signal is appropriate. While the long-term expected return is very attractive, the high volatility, recent negative price action, and reliance on speculative events make DOGE-USD a high-risk investment. Investors should closely monitor news and market trends and be prepared for significant price swings.
