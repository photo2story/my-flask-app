## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Overview & Key Figures:**

DOGE-USD, or Dogecoin, is a cryptocurrency and a meme-based payment system.  The following analysis uses provided data to assess its performance.

* **Cumulative Return (DOGE-USD):** 5637.93%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 97.29%
* **Return Difference (DOGE-USD - VOO):** 5540.64%
* **Relative Divergence:** 24.2% (This means the current outperformance of DOGE-USD relative to VOO sits at the 24.2nd percentile of its historical range of divergence)


**1. Performance Analysis:**

Dogecoin has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period, exhibiting a cumulative return vastly exceeding that of the index.  However, this is a very volatile asset.  The provided CAGR data (compound annual growth rate) reveals periods of extreme gains and losses. The high Beta values indicate significant sensitivity to market movements (especially in 2019-2021), while the consistently low Alpha values suggest underperformance relative to the broader market over most periods, except the most recent years. The recent period has higher alpha, however this is prone to change and doesn't represent long term market behavior.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values highlight the substantial risk associated with Dogecoin investments.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.3294
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.3275
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.3541
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.3626

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day averages indicates a recent price stagnation.  However, the substantial gap between the current price and the 60-day average suggests a longer-term downward pressure. The last day's price change (-0.64%) shows a minor decrease which does not represent a significant shift in price.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 21.42  This indicates the asset is currently in oversold territory, implying potential for upward correction but not guaranteed future performance.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.20  Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.6% This reflects a recent short-term downward trend.

The provided data points to a potentially volatile asset currently in a bearish phase. The expected return of 6731.2% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is highly speculative, given the past volatility and lack of predictive power.  While the high expected return is tempting, it must be interpreted cautiously considering the extremely high risk associated with this asset class.  While the last market change reflects a small drop, it’s important to continuously monitor price action and avoid reading too much into a single day’s movement.



**Conclusion:**

Dogecoin has demonstrated exceptionally high returns in certain periods but also carries extremely high risk.  Its volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations are substantial.  The current technical indicators suggest a bearish momentum. While the extremely high projected long-term return is appealing, it's critical to approach any investment in Dogecoin with extreme caution and a thorough understanding of its inherent volatility and lack of fundamental value.  The extremely high risk makes long-term investing a gamble, not a certainty.
