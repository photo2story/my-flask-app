## DOGE-USD Investment Report

**1. Performance Analysis:**

DOGE-USD is a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin token.  Its cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  While the S&P 500 shows a cumulative return of 103.85%, DOGE-USD boasts a staggering 9093.39% return. This represents a substantial divergence, with a difference of 8989.5%, placing it in the 33.2nd percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility and inconsistent correlation with the market, with significant Alpha only appearing in recent years (2021-2024).  The large variation in Beta across different periods highlights the unpredictable nature of this asset.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

DOGE-USD is currently priced at $0.41 (last market: $0.40).  The short-term trends are mildly positive:

* **5-day moving average:** $0.41
* **20-day moving average:** $0.36
* **60-day moving average:** $0.21

The price is above its short-term moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (51.44):**  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions, suggesting a relatively neutral momentum.
* **PPO (-3.18):** Suggests bearish momentum in the short-term.  The negative value indicates that the 12-period moving average is below the 26-period moving average.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** A positive change of 19.6% indicates recent short-term upward momentum.

The expected return of 7551.6% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is exceptionally high and should be viewed with extreme caution due to the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

DOGE-USD has shown extraordinary returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with significant risk.  The high volatility, as evidenced by the Beta and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures, makes it a highly speculative investment.  While the recent price movement and relative strength indicators show some positive short-term momentum, the long-term outlook remains highly uncertain.  The extremely high projected return should be treated with skepticism, as such projections rarely prove accurate for volatile assets like cryptocurrencies.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence, including independent research and consideration of your risk tolerance, is crucial.  The current positive short-term indicators should be interpreted cautiously in light of the inherent volatility and speculative nature of Dogecoin.
