## DOGE-USD Investment Review

This report analyzes DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin network,  comparing its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

DOGE-USD exhibits significantly higher cumulative returns (3599.82%) compared to VOO (39.17%) as of the last data point.  The difference is substantial (3560.7), placing it at the 90th percentile (relative divergence of 24.7) of its historical range against VOO. However, this high return is not necessarily indicative of consistent outperformance.  The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals considerable volatility and inconsistent performance across different periods.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) | Notes                                         |
|------------|----------|--------|-------|-------|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 2017-2019  | -27.0%   | 72.7%  | -0.0  | 0.3   |        | Significant negative return. Low Beta.        |
| 2018-2020  | -23.0%   | 72.7%  | 0.0   | 0.7   |        | Still negative return, slightly higher Beta. |
| 2019-2021  | 3254.0%  | 63.1%  | 0.1   | 26.1  |        | Massive positive return, extremely high Beta. |
| 2020-2022  | 1530.0%  | 76.6%  | 0.1   | 10.5  |        | High positive return, high Beta.              |
| 2021-2023  | 960.0%   | 76.6%  | 0.4   | 13.9  |        | High positive return, high Beta.              |
| 2022-2024  | 4217.0%  | 80.4%  | 0.3   | 48.3  |        | Extremely high positive return, very high Beta.|
| 2023-2025  | 1548.0%  | 80.4%  | 0.3   | 24.4  |        | High positive return, high Beta.              |

The high Beta values consistently indicate significant sensitivity to market movements.  The substantial swings in CAGR highlight the extreme volatility of DOGE-USD.  While periods of exceptionally high returns exist, they are punctuated by periods of substantial losses.  Positive alpha values in recent years suggest some degree of outperformance, but this needs to be considered in the context of high risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 0.159388
* **Last Market Price:** 0.163644 (2.68% increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 0.1571
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 0.1582
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.1787

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent 2.68% increase in the last market price indicates a potential short-term upward correction, but further observation is needed.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 56.94 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.72 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 6024.7% (This extremely high number needs further context.  Is this an annualized return? What assumptions underpin this projection?  The high volatility makes any long-term projection highly uncertain).

The recent price increase needs to be interpreted cautiously given the historical volatility.  While the PPO suggests bullish momentum, the RSI is not significantly overbought and the negative relative divergence suggests some short-term downward pressure. The projected long-term expected return of 6024.7% against the S&P 500 is exceptionally high and requires critical evaluation of the underlying model and assumptions.  Given the inherent risks associated with DOGE-USD, this projection should be treated with extreme skepticism.


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has demonstrated periods of extraordinary returns but also significant losses.  Its high volatility and high Beta make it an extremely risky investment. While the recent price movement and some indicators hint at potential short-term gains, long-term investment decisions should carefully consider the historical data, the inherent volatility, and the significant uncertainty associated with the extremely high projected return relative to the S&P 500.  Further due diligence and risk assessment are strongly recommended before any investment.
