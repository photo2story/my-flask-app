## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Overview:**

DOGE-USD, or Dogecoin, is a cryptocurrency and a peer-to-peer digital currency.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

Dogecoin has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The cumulative return for DOGE-USD is 3273.71%, while the cumulative return for VOO is 86.01%.  This results in a substantial divergence, with a current difference of 3187.7%. The relative divergence of 14.0% indicates that DOGE-USD's performance is positioned relatively higher than the vast majority of past performance data points when compared to the S&P 500's performance, considering the maximum historical difference (23063.5%) and minimum (-45.3%).  However, this high relative divergence needs to be considered alongside the high volatility indicated by the MDD and the Beta values in the following table.

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -96.0%     | 49.9%  | -0.0  | 0.3   |        |
| 2018-2020  | -157.0%    | 49.9%  | -0.0  | 0.7   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 4929.0%    | 26.6%  | -0.0  | 24.3  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 1547.0%    | 36.4%  | -0.0  | 9.8   |        |
| 2021-2023  | 98.0%      | 36.4%  | 0.4   | 13.0  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 1484.0%    | 39.4%  | 0.4   | 45.0  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 1107.0%    | 39.4%  | 0.5   | 28.2  |        |

The high Beta values (especially in 2019-2021) indicate a high sensitivity to market movements, magnifying both gains and losses.  The consistently low or near-zero Alpha values suggest that DOGE-USD's returns are largely explained by market movements rather than unique factors.  The substantial volatility (high MDD values) highlights the risk associated with this asset.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.19797
* **Last Market Price:** $0.19014
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.2005
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.2249
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.2871

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change shows a small decrease (-1.08%).

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 36.1 – Suggests the asset is approaching oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -0.15 – Indicates a bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.4 – Shows a recent decrease in relative strength against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 12959.2% – This extremely high projected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism. Given the high volatility and inherent risks associated with cryptocurrencies, especially one as volatile as Dogecoin, such a high expected return is unlikely to materialize, and in fact is probably unrealistic.  This projection likely doesn't factor in potential regulatory changes, market crashes, or technological advancements that could significantly impact Dogecoin's price.


**Conclusion:**

While Dogecoin has shown exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500 in the past, its high volatility, high Beta, and low Alpha, coupled with the bearish signals from technical indicators (PPO and RSI) and recent price action, suggest a significant risk profile. The exceptionally high projected return should be treated with caution.  Any investment in Dogecoin should be considered a highly speculative venture, and should only be undertaken with a full understanding of the inherent risks involved and with capital that one can afford to lose entirely.
