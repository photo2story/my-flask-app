The cumulative return of DOGE-USD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

The relative divergence indicates that DOGE-USD's performance is at the 90th percentile relative to its historical performance compared to the S&P 500.  This high relative divergence highlights the significant outperformance, but it's crucial to remember this is relative to its own volatile history and not a guarantee of future returns.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**  Dogecoin's high volatility is evident in the table below. The high beta values, especially in 2019-2021 and 2020-2022, show extreme sensitivity to market movements.  Alpha values suggest periods of outperformance, but these are overshadowed by the extremely high risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

| Metric           | Value |
|-------------------|-------|
| Closing Price     | $0.38 |

| 60-Day MA        | $0.18 |

The price is above all moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, the large difference between the short-term and long-term moving averages highlights the volatility of the asset.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (79.39):**  Indicates the asset is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (-1.11):**  Shows a bearish signal, indicating that the price momentum is weakening.
* **Relative Divergence (20-Day):** Positive and significant, suggesting a strong short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (439.69%):** This represents a significant potential return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), but it's crucial to note that this projection is based on past volatile data and doesn't guarantee future performance.  The high potential return is accompanied by high risk. A price of $0.4 would suggest a recent sharp price increase.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DOGE-USD has shown spectacular returns in the past, massively outperforming the S&P 500. However, this performance is accompanied by extreme volatility and risk.  The current overbought RSI and bearish PPO signal suggest a potential short-term correction is likely. The extremely high expected return over the long-term is contingent on continued market speculation and adoption, and it remains highly uncertain.  Before investing, a thorough understanding of cryptocurrency markets and risk tolerance is crucial. The lack of traditional financial data makes fundamental analysis impossible, relying solely on technical analysis and market sentiment.  Further research into recent news and analyst opinions is critical before making any investment decisions.
