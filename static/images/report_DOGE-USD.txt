## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) is a cryptocurrency.  Its performance significantly outpaces the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility and substantial risk.  While past performance shows enormous gains,  the high RSI and PPO suggest potential overbought conditions.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Dogecoin's cumulative return (4070.16%) vastly exceeds the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (52.13%). The current divergence is 4018.0, representing the 27.8th percentile of its historical range (max: 14531.5, min: -34.2).  This illustrates extremely high volatility and significant deviation from the market benchmark.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance. Early periods show negative or near-zero alpha and low beta, suggesting poor performance relative to the market. However, more recent periods (2019-2025) show extremely high positive alpha and substantially elevated beta, indicating exceptional returns but also exceptionally high risk correlated to overall market movements.  The large swings in beta highlight the significant influence of market sentiment on DOGE's price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)  Indicates a moderate level of risk associated with the asset.
* **RSI:** 74.32  High RSI suggests the asset is overbought, increasing the likelihood of a price correction.
* **PPO:** 0.94  Positive and relatively high PPO indicates bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.4  This short-term downward shift suggests potential weakening momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 5137.7%  This extremely high expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) needs to be viewed in the context of the extreme volatility and risk associated with Dogecoin.  Such projections should be treated with extreme caution.


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has shown extraordinary returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this performance is coupled with extreme volatility and high risk. The current technical indicators suggest potential overbought conditions. Investors should proceed with extreme caution, understanding the inherent risks associated with this highly speculative asset. The high expected return, while enticing, is not a guarantee and should be viewed with significant skepticism given the asset's unpredictable nature.
