## DOGE-USD Investment Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin meme, has exhibited exceptionally high cumulative returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods. However, this performance is characterized by high volatility and risk, as indicated by substantial maximum drawdown (MDD) and beta values.  Recent price action suggests a potentially overbought condition, warranting caution.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Ticker:** DOGE-USD
* **Company Overview:** A decentralized, meme-based cryptocurrency.
* **Cumulative Return (DOGE-USD):** 4046.89%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 42.27%
* **Return Difference:** 4004.6%  (This represents a massive outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, the relative divergence of 27.7% indicates this level of outperformance is relatively high compared to historical ranges of outperformance and underperformance).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a highly volatile investment.  While Alpha values suggest periods of outperformance relative to the market (especially from 2019-2025), the extremely high Beta values (particularly 24.9 and 46.2 in some periods) highlight significant market sensitivity and risk.  The large swings in CAGR and substantial MDD emphasize this volatility.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD (%) | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -27.0%   | 72.7    | -0.0  | 0.3   |        |
| 2018-2020  | -23.0%   | 72.7    | 0.0   | 0.7   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 3254.0%  | 63.1    | 0.1   | 24.9  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 1530.0%  | 76.6    | 0.1   | 10.0  |        |
| 2021-2023  | 960.0%   | 76.6    | 0.4   | 13.3  |        |
| 2022-2024  | 4217.0%  | 80.4    | 0.3   | 46.2  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 1995.0%  | 80.4    | 0.3   | 26.1  |        |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.1786
* **Last Market Price:** $0.1757 (down -1.65% from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.1616
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.1589
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.1777

The price is slightly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term correction after a recent rally.  The price is above both the 5 and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 72.03 (Approaching overbought territory; values above 70 typically suggest an overbought condition).
* **PPO:** 1.579 (Positive value indicates bullish momentum but the magnitude should be considered in context).
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.2 (Short-term upward trend).
* **Expected Return:** 5138.7% (This extremely high expected return is likely based on past volatile performance and not a reliable prediction of future returns)

The recent price drop of -1.65% is a relatively small move and does not represent a significant "crash" or "sharp decline".  However, the high RSI value (72.03) and medium market risk indicator suggest a potential for a pullback in the near term.

**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has demonstrated remarkable returns but comes with substantial risk. The high volatility, significant MDD, and extremely high beta values highlight the speculative nature of this investment. While the long-term expected return is impressive, it should be viewed with extreme caution given the inherent risk and potential for large price swings.  Current indicators suggest a potential short-term correction may be due.  Any investment decision should be made only after careful consideration of the associated risks and a thorough understanding of the cryptocurrency market.
