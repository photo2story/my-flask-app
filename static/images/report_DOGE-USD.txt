**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Dogecoin's CAGR fluctuates wildly.  Periods of massive gains (e.g., 2019-2021, 2022-2024) are interspersed with periods of significant losses (e.g., 2018-2020, 2023-2025). This highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of Dogecoin.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD figures are consistently high, indicating substantial potential losses for investors who buy at peaks. This underscores the volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values generally mirror the CAGR, showing strong positive Alpha during boom periods and negative Alpha during downturns, when compared to S&P500.
*   **Beta:** Dogecoin's Beta is greater than 1 in all periods except for 2018-2020, indicating that its price tends to be more volatile than the market as a whole (S&P 500). In the period of 2021-2023 the beta value is equal to 1.8, so Dogecoin is 80% more volatile than the S&P 500
*   **Cap(B):**  This metric shows large values, indicating a higher level of volatility compared to the S\&P500.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Dogecoin is exhibiting high volatility and a speculative nature. Its recent performance has outperformed the S&P 500 significantly. However, past performance is not indicative of future results, especially with volatile assets like Dogecoin.

*   **Positive Factors:** The MRI suggests a favorable investment environment, and the Hybrid Signal recommends buying. The last market data shows an increase of 2.71%.
*   **Negative Factors:**  The high MDD, fluctuating CAGR, negative PPO, and negative change in relative divergence all point to risk. The dependence on hype and social media sentiment makes it prone to sudden price swings.

**News Impact:** The news articles highlight both potential future growth and inherent risks, from price predictions to market corrections. The reverse merger announcement could introduce new dynamics.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in Dogecoin is a high-risk, potentially high-reward proposition. It's suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a thorough understanding of the cryptocurrency market. Based on the data and news, further research and risk assessment are advised before making any investment decisions.
