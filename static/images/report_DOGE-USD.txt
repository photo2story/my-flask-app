## DOGE-USD Stock Report

This report analyzes the performance of DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin token.


**1. Performance Analysis & Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

DOGE-USD has shown a cumulative return of 4290.55%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 99.47%.  The difference in cumulative returns between DOGE-USD and VOO is 4191.1%, placing it at the 18.3rd percentile of its historical range (max: 23063.5%, min: -45.3%). This high relative percentile indicates that the current outperformance is significant compared to its historical volatility.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis across different years shows highly volatile performance. While recent years show extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), earlier years demonstrate substantial losses.  The high Beta values (especially in 2019-2021) indicate high sensitivity to market movements, which is typical of volatile cryptocurrencies.  The near-zero Alpha values in earlier periods suggest the returns were primarily driven by market movements, whereas the positive Alpha values in recent years imply some degree of outperformance.  It's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 0.25486
* **Last Market Price:** 0.24428
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 0.2569
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 0.2621
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.3184

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  However, the recent change of 2.07% indicates a slight upward movement compared to the previous close.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.04  (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.66 (Positive value suggests a bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.7 (Indicates a short-term bearish trend)

The provided `Last-market` data shows a recent price increase of 2.07%. While not a dramatic surge, it's worth noting this small positive change.

The expected return of 9476.4% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a very high figure.  This projection is highly speculative given the extreme volatility of DOGE-USD and should be interpreted cautiously.  It's critical to remember that such high returns are accompanied by significantly increased risk.


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD's performance has been highly volatile and vastly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past. However, its high volatility and beta suggest substantial risk. The current price is below its moving averages, signaling a possible downward trend, despite a recent minor price increase.  The extremely high projected long-term return should be viewed with considerable skepticism due to inherent risks in cryptocurrency investments.  Thorough research and risk assessment are crucial before any investment decision.
