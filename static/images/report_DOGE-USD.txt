**Analysis of Alpha, Beta:**

*   **CAGR:** Dogecoin's Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) varies wildly depending on the period. Some periods show significant losses, while others show enormous gains. This highlights the extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating substantial risk of loss.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is the excess return compared to the benchmark. The values swing wildly.
*   **Beta:** Beta is close to 0 in several periods, indicating very low correlation with the market (S&P 500). When beta is near 0, the stock is not being largely affected by market movements, or the company is not influenced much by overall market trends.
*   **Cap(B):** Cap is a measurement that compares the market cap of the security relative to the benchmark index. The higher the Cap Beta, the greater the difference between the security market cap and the benchmark's market cap.

*   **5-day SMA:** 0.1455
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.1507
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.1826

**Analysis of Price Fluctuations:**

*   The current price is above the 5-day SMA but below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a recent upward trend, but it's still below longer-term moving averages.
*   The positive price change reflects fluctuation, showing positive momentum.

**3) Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)

*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.56

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.7 (Negative: Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 10994.3%

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** Contradictory to the high volatility suggested by the MDD figures, the MRI indicates that Dogecoin is deemed 'High Investment Recommended' because of the algorithm output of how undervalued it is
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 45.15 suggests that Dogecoin is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** The PPO is positive, suggesting the short-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  This signal indicates a strong buy recommendation.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative recent change in relative divergence indicates a short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return should be viewed with skepticism, considering the historical volatility of Dogecoin.

However, there are also articles suggesting alternative investments and cautioning against certain Dogecoin-related stocks. The news cycle seems to be contributing to the volatility.
