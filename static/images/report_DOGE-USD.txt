## DOGE-USD Report

**0. Overview:**

DOGE-USD, also known as Dogecoin, is a cryptocurrency based on the popular Doge meme.  This report analyzes its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) using provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 4135.31%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 47.37%
* **Return Difference:** 4087.94% (DOGE significantly outperforms VOO)
* **Relative Divergence:** 28.3% (This indicates DOGE's performance is in the higher range of historical relative performance compared to VOO, but it's not a measure of future performance.)


The table below shows the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta, and market capitalization for DOGE-USD over different periods.  Note that high Beta values (particularly those above 1)  indicate much greater volatility than the benchmark (S&P 500).  Alpha, showing excess return above the market, is surprisingly consistent despite massive return swings.

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -27.0%     | 72.7%  | -0.0  | 0.3   |        |
| 2018-2020  | -23.0%     | 72.7%  | 0.0   | 0.7   |        |
| 2019-2021  | 3254.0%   | 63.1%  | 0.1   | 25.8  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 1530.0%   | 76.6%  | 0.1   | 10.3  |        |

| 2022-2024  | 4217.0%   | 80.4%  | 0.3   | 47.7  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 2083.0%   | 80.4%  | 0.3   | 27.6  |        |

**Analysis:** DOGE-USD demonstrates extremely high volatility and significant performance swings, as indicated by both the large CAGR variations and the high Beta values.  While Alpha shows some outperformance, the massive swings and high Beta suggest extremely high risk. The dramatically high CAGR figures in recent years highlight its speculative nature and sensitivity to market sentiment.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.182
* **Last Market Price:** $0.185  (1.84% increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.171
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.160
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.176

The price is currently above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, given the historical volatility, this trend may be short-lived.  The small price change indicates a relatively mild positive movement.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 73.27 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction.)
* **PPO:** 2.41 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.4% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 4990.5% (This is a very high expected return with a high degree of uncertainty, given the inherent volatility of Dogecoin.)


The relatively small price change of 1.84% is not significant enough to indicate a drastic uptrend or downtrend.  However, the combination of the high RSI and the high expected return indicates caution. The high expected return likely reflects the potential of a high-growth asset but also indicates elevated risk.

**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has historically shown extreme volatility and significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  While current indicators suggest a short-term uptrend, its high risk profile is undeniable.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution and fully understand the speculative nature of this asset before investing.  The high expected return is coupled with extreme risk and uncertainty, making a long-term investment decision heavily dependent on individual risk tolerance.
