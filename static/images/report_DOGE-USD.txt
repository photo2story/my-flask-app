## DOGE-USD Investment Report

**1. Performance Analysis & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing the Dogecoin digital asset, shows a cumulative return of 5755.28% over an unspecified period.  This is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 92.79%. The difference in cumulative returns between DOGE-USD and VOO is approximately 5662.5%, placing its relative performance at the 24.7th percentile based on historical data (relative to its historical maximum and minimum divergence from the VOO).  While the sheer magnitude of the return is impressive,  the high volatility and beta (as shown in the subsequent table) highlight considerable risk.

| 2023-2025  | 3588.0%  | 39.4%    | -0.0    | 50.0   |        |

The highly volatile nature of DOGE-USD is evident in the fluctuating CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and significant maximum drawdown (MDD) figures. The near-zero alpha suggests it doesn't consistently outperform the market after adjusting for risk (beta).  The dramatically changing Beta values indicate substantial shifts in its sensitivity to market movements.
