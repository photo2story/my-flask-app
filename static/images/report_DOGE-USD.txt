**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 0.1815769970417022
* **Last Market Price:** 0.1730005
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 0.1777
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 0.1693
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.1714

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it sits above the 20 and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential support levels.  The recent price change of -1.57% signals a minor decrease.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 74.32 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.94 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 5137.7% (This extremely high figure should be treated with caution due to the inherent volatility of DOGE-USD.)


The relatively high RSI and positive PPO present a conflicting signal.  While PPO suggests upward momentum, the RSI suggests that the price might be overbought, potentially leading to a price correction.  The negative 20-day relative divergence change further supports the short-term bearish outlook.  The provided -1.57% change in the last market price suggests a minor downward movement rather than a sharp drop.  The extremely high expected return highlights the potential for significant gains but also underscores the substantial risk involved.

**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has demonstrated exceptional returns but exhibits extreme volatility. While the long-term expected return is high, the current technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction.  Investors should proceed with caution, considering the inherent risks associated with this highly volatile asset. A well-defined risk management strategy is crucial for any investment in DOGE-USD.
