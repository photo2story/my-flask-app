DOGE-USD has demonstrated exceptionally high volatility and returns in the past.  While the current price is above its recent moving averages, suggesting potential short-term upward momentum, the extremely high projected long-term return should be treated with extreme caution.

The highly positive cumulative return is largely driven by past performance, which is not a reliable indicator of future gains.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough research into the current market sentiment, regulatory landscape, and technological developments is crucial.  The extremely high expected return needs a critical assessment given its inherent risks.  Considering the risks involved, a diversified portfolio approach would be strongly recommended.
