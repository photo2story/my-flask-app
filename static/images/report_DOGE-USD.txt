## Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) Investment Review

**0. Key Figures & Summary:**

Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) is a cryptocurrency, a decentralized digital currency.  The following analysis examines its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) using provided data.  Note that Dogecoin's high volatility significantly impacts its risk profile.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 4669.12%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 73.72%
* **Return Difference:** 4595.40% (This shows DOGE-USD significantly outperformed VOO over the measured period. However, this is a historical figure and not indicative of future performance.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 16.1% (This places the current performance within the upper range of historical performance relative to VOO; it is not a prediction of future performance).


The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals extremely volatile performance.  While periods of exceptionally high returns exist (e.g., 6117% CAGR in 2019-2021), this is offset by significant drawdowns (MDD). Beta values fluctuate wildly, indicating highly variable correlation with the market (sometimes extremely high positive correlation and sometimes low).  The large market cap (reaching over 46 Billion) indicates there is a considerable investment volume and is another indicator of its speculative nature. This volatility makes it crucial to consider risk tolerance before investing.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $0.1719
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.1709
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.1745
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.2133

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  However, the recent price change of 3.15% indicates a recent price increase, which might be a temporary fluctuation.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4444 (Low-Medium Risk) – This suggests a relatively low to moderate risk level.  However, the historical volatility of DOGE warrants further caution.
* **RSI:** 52.36 – This is near the neutral level (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.76 – A positive value suggests potential bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.0% (Short-term downtrend) – This reinforces the observation from moving averages.
* **Expected Return:** 15965.0% – This extremely high projected return over a long-term (2+ years) horizon is noteworthy but highly speculative given the inherent volatility of DOGE and its speculative nature.  It is crucial to view this figure with significant skepticism and awareness of the risks.  The extremely high value likely stems from the historically high return rates previously shown in the provided data, and does not account for future market conditions.

**Conclusion:**

Dogecoin's performance has historically been highly volatile, showing periods of massive gains and losses.  While its cumulative return far exceeds that of the S&P 500 over the measured historical period, this is not indicative of future performance. The current indicators suggest a potential short-term downtrend, but the high expected return over the long term (while not impossible) requires an extremely high risk tolerance due to the cryptocurrency's inherent volatility. Investors should carefully consider their risk profile before investing in Dogecoin.  This analysis is based solely on the provided data and does not constitute financial advice.
