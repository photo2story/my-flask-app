**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 3515.14%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 42.21%
* **Return Difference:**  3472.93% (DOGE-USD significantly outperforms VOO)

The table below shows that while DOGE-USD has experienced periods of massive gains, it's also highly volatile, indicated by large Maximum Drawdowns (MDD). The alpha values suggest periods of outperformance against the market, but beta values, especially in recent years, are very high, indicating extreme sensitivity to market movements.  The high beta values significantly impact the interpretation of the alpha.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.1557
* **Last Market Price:** $0.1579
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.1571
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.1605
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.1852

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.66 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.4633 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but needs context of historical values)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.4 (+), indicating short-term upward movement.
* **Expected Return:** 6227.1% (This exceptionally high expected return needs careful consideration.  It's likely based on historical volatility and doesn't account for potential future market corrections or changes in investor sentiment).

The small positive change in the last market price (0.22%) does not suggest a significant upward or downward shift. The extremely high expected return warrants caution.  The historical data shows extremely high volatility, making any long-term projection highly uncertain.  While a long-term investment *could* result in high returns, the risk is substantial.  The extremely high beta indicates that market downturns will likely severely impact its value.
