2025-10-29 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's an analysis of Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) based on the data you provided, presented in a structured format suitable for a report:

**Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) Analysis**

**Company Overview:** Dogecoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency that started as a meme-inspired alternative to more traditional cryptocurrencies.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 3796.68%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 83.03%
*   **Absolute Divergence:** 3760.7
*   **Relative Divergence:** 33.6 (meaning the current divergence is at the 33.6th percentile of its historical range).

**Analysis:** Dogecoin has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. However, the relative divergence of 33.6 suggests that while positive, the current outperformance is not at the extreme high end of its historical range. This high level of outperformance needs to be heavily discounted because it is a speculative asset.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| 2017-2019  | -40.0%   | 77.9%   | -49.0%   | 0.0    | 0.3    |
| 2018-2020  | -78.0%   | 77.9%   | -102.0%  | 0.0    | 0.7    |
| 2019-2021  | 3429.0%  | 78.0%   | 3383.0%  | -0.0   | 25.8   |
| 2020-2022  | 1808.0%  | 86.2%   | 1809.0%  | -0.0   | 10.7   |
| 2021-2023  | 1973.0%  | 86.2%   | 1972.0%  | 0.0    | 13.6   |
| 2022-2024  | 4805.0%  | 86.2%   | 4784.0%  | 0.0    | 47.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 1426.0%  | 82.8%   | 1358.0%  | 0.2    | 29.3   |

*   **CAGR:**  Extremely volatile, ranging from negative returns to massive growth, reflecting Dogecoin's speculative nature.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values indicate significant price volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Very high Alpha values suggest substantial outperformance relative to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally low, except for a period (2019-2021) with an outlier beta. This indicates a change in correlation during this time (market beta during this period was significantly skewed).

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 0.1934
*   **Previous Close:** 0.1938
*   **Price Change:** -0.17%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 0.198
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 0.1983
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 0.2279

**Analysis:** The price is slightly down from the previous close. The short-term (5-day and 20-day) moving averages are below the 60-day moving average, which *could* indicate a potential short-term downward trend or consolidation phase.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 47.87 (Neutral - Neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.6041 (Positive, suggesting a possible upward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.3 (+) (Short-term increase in outperformance)
*   **Expected Return:** 6865.4% (Long-term projected excess return vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a *High Investment Recommended*, but this should be viewed with extreme skepticism for a volatile cryptocurrency like Dogecoin.
*   The RSI is neutral.
*   The PPO indicates a possible upward trend.
*   The recent increase in relative divergence supports a short-term upward trajectory.
*   The extremely high "Expected Return" should be heavily discounted due to the speculative and unpredictable nature of cryptocurrencies.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

The provided news headlines are *unrelated* to Dogecoin or cryptocurrencies. They cover topics like:

*   Analyst price target adjustments for Globe Life and Fiserv.
*   Construction of a palliative care unit.
*   Deutsche Bank Q3 earnings.
*   Bank of Canada interest rate cut.

**Analysis:**  The lack of relevant news makes it difficult to assess the impact of external events on Dogecoin.

**5. Overall Assessment:**

Dogecoin has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but also exhibits substantial volatility and risk. Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with a positive PPO and increasing relative divergence, but a neutral RSI. The MRI should not be considered reliable for such a speculative asset.

The key concern is the disconnect between the quantitative data and the *qualitative reality* of Dogecoin. Its price is heavily influenced by social media trends, sentiment, and overall cryptocurrency market dynamics, making it difficult to predict based solely on historical price data.

**Recommendation:**

Investing in Dogecoin is highly speculative and carries substantial risk. The potential for high returns is balanced by the potential for significant losses. Any investment should be made with extreme caution and should represent only a small fraction of an overall portfolio. The "Expected Return" figure should be regarded as highly unreliable. Investors should closely monitor news and social media sentiment related to Dogecoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.
