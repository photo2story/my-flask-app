## DOGE-USD Stock Report

**0. Overview:**

DOGE-USD, commonly known as Dogecoin, is a cryptocurrency and a meme-based token.  It's known for its volatility and community-driven nature.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

The cumulative return of DOGE-USD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns between DOGE-USD (3688.17%) and VOO (73.72%) is substantial, at approximately **3614.5 percentage points**.  While the relative divergence (14.8%) indicates that the current divergence is within the historical range, the absolute difference highlights the markedly different performance trajectories.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows highly volatile performance with periods of extreme gains and losses. The high beta values in several periods suggest high sensitivity to market movements, particularly between 2019 and 2022.  The alpha values, while largely near zero, show some positive alpha during 2021-2025, indicating potential outperformance in those periods.  However, the significant volatility and risk (as reflected in the Maximum Drawdown - MDD) must be considered.

**3. Technical Indicators & Risk Assessment:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 53.56 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.8435 (Positive; suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.7 (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 13955% (This is a very high number, suggesting extremely high potential return versus VOO over the long term; However, it's crucial to understand this is based on past performance which is not indicative of future results. The volatility inherent in Dogecoin makes this figure unreliable as a prediction.)

The small price change (-$0.17) doesn't signal a significant event (no sharp upward or downward movement).  The high expected return needs considerable caution, given the highly volatile nature of DOGE-USD.  Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.  Long-term investment requires a high risk tolerance and a thorough understanding of the cryptocurrency market.  The 13955% figure should be treated with extreme skepticism.
