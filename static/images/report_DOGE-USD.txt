This report analyzes the performance of DOGE-USD, a cryptocurrency representing Dogecoin, a peer-to-peer digital currency.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

DOGE-USD has shown a cumulative return of 3953.77%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 49.41%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 3904.4%, placing it at the 27th percentile of the historical range (-34.2% to 14531.5%).

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis highlights the high volatility and significant performance swings of DOGE-USD. While the alpha values suggest periods of outperformance, the extremely high betas demonstrate its sensitivity to market fluctuations and extreme risk.  The substantial market capitalization variations also reflect the asset's unpredictable nature.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 0.1746
* **Last Market Price:** 0.1745
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 0.1794
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 0.1666
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.1732

The price is currently below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potentially more positive longer-term outlook. The small negative change in the last market price (-0.08%) indicates minimal price movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.379 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 75.22 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 1.45 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.7 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 5343.5% (This exceptionally high figure needs to be viewed with extreme caution, given the inherent volatility of DOGE-USD and the limitations of forecasting such high returns.  It likely reflects past performance, not a guaranteed future outcome.)


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has historically exhibited exceptional returns, far surpassing the S&P 500.  However, this comes with extremely high volatility and risk. The current indicators show a mixed signal:  while momentum is positive (PPO), the RSI suggests the asset may be overbought and the price is slightly below its 5-day moving average.  The exceptionally high projected return should be treated with significant skepticism; past performance is not indicative of future results.  Investing in DOGE-USD requires a high tolerance for risk.  Any investment decision should be made after thorough due diligence and consideration of personal risk tolerance.
