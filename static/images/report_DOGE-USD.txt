## DOGE-USD Performance Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) is a cryptocurrency, a decentralized digital currency.  This report analyzes its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering price movements, technical indicators, and projected returns.  While DOGE-USD has shown significantly higher cumulative returns than VOO in certain periods, it also exhibits higher volatility and risk.

**1. Cumulative Return and Comparison to S&P 500:**

* **DOGE-USD Cumulative Return:** 4135.31%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 47.37%
* **Return Difference:** 4087.94%

DOGE-USD's cumulative return drastically outperforms VOO. However, the provided relative divergence of 28.3% indicates that while currently significantly outperforming VOO, this performance is not unprecedented within its historical context.  The substantial difference highlights the significantly higher risk associated with DOGE-USD compared to the relatively stable S&P 500.


The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows wildly fluctuating performance, with large periods of negative returns followed by periods of explosive growth.  The high Beta values (particularly in 2019-2021 and 2020-2022) indicate that DOGE-USD's price is highly sensitive to market movements, reflecting significant volatility.  The Alpha values, while positive in recent years, are not consistently high, suggesting performance that is not consistently outperforming the market beyond the influence of its high Beta.  The market capitalization fluctuates significantly.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $0.1825
* **Last Market Price:** $0.1818
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $0.1709
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $0.1603
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $0.1755

The closing price is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages but significantly above the 20-day moving average.  This suggests a recent price increase, but the small negative change (-0.37%) from the previous close indicates limited recent momentum.  The price is relatively close to its 60-day moving average, suggesting some consolidation or potential sideways movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 73.27 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.41 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 4990.5% (vs. S&P 500)

The MRI suggests a medium level of risk. The high RSI value indicates that DOGE-USD is approaching overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback. The positive PPO confirms the short-term upward trend, consistent with the 20-day relative divergence change.  The extremely high expected return of 4990.5% highlights the potential for significant gains but also the inherent high risk associated with this projection. This projection is highly dependent on the continued and extreme volatility seen in the past and should be viewed cautiously.


**Conclusion:**

DOGE-USD has demonstrated periods of exceptional returns exceeding the S&P 500. However, this performance is characterized by high volatility and risk, as reflected in the high Beta, fluctuating CAGR, and technical indicators.  While the expected return is enticing, investors should proceed with caution, understanding the substantial risk involved and the potential for significant price swings.  Long-term investment requires a high tolerance for risk and a clear understanding that historical high returns are not guaranteed to continue.
