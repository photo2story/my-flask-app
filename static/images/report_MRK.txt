This places MRK at a relative divergence of 7.7, indicating its performance is in the lower percentile compared to its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

While some periods show significant positive alpha (outperformance relative to the benchmark), others show substantial negative alpha.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

MRK's closing price is 100.06, with the last market price at 100.53.  Short-term moving averages (5-day: 100.14, 20-day: 100.22) are very close to the current price, suggesting a relatively flat trend. However, the 60-day moving average (103.79) is higher, indicating a decline in price over the past two months.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 47.70 suggests MRK is neither overbought nor oversold.
* PPO: 0.15 is slightly positive, hinting at potential upward momentum.
* Recent Relative Divergence Change: -0.6 indicates a decreasing trend in relative performance against the S&P 500 over the past 20 days.
* Expected Return: 0.0% suggests no expected outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* Latest Quarterly Results: Q3 2024 EPS (1.25) declined compared to Q2 2024 (2.15) and Q1 2024 (1.88).  Revenue ($16.66B) slightly increased compared to Q2 2024 ($16.11B) and Q1 2024 ($15.78B). The November 2024 figures are seemingly duplicated from November 2023. 
* Revenue Growth Trends: Revenue shows a generally increasing trend over the reported periods.
* EPS Trends: EPS shows volatility with a significant decline in the most recent quarter.
* Beats/Misses:  Without consensus estimates, it's impossible to determine if these results beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* Revenue and Profitability: Revenue shows a consistent upward trend. Profit margins remain strong and relatively stable in the high 70% range.
* Capital and Profitability:  Equity has generally increased over the quarters. ROE fluctuates considerably, with a negative value in Q4 2023 but rebounding in subsequent quarters. The most recent ROE (7.09%) is lower than the preceding quarters, despite higher revenue and similar profit margins. This warrants further investigation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* Earnings News: The most recent earnings release (Q3 2024) showed a decline in EPS despite revenue growth. This should be investigated further to understand the underlying reasons.
* Market Outlook and Analyst Opinions:  This information is not provided and would be crucial for a complete analysis.


**7. Summary:**

MRK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While revenue has been growing and profit margins remain strong, recent earnings showed a concerning drop in EPS. The ROE has also declined in the latest quarter. Technical indicators suggest a neutral near-term outlook with no expected long-term outperformance against the S&P 500.  Further investigation is needed regarding the reasons behind the declining EPS and ROE, as well as current market outlook and analyst opinions to form a more conclusive investment thesis.  The duplicated earnings data for November 2023 and 2024 should be clarified.
