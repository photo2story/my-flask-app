While Alpha fluctuates, suggesting periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market, the Beta consistently remains above 0.1 (except for the 2023-2025 period), indicating a relatively high sensitivity to market movements.

The consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) also signifies considerable risk associated with MRK investment.  Market capitalization (Cap) shows substantial growth over the observed period.

* **Long-Term (2+ years) Expected Return vs S&P 500:**  The data provided doesn't allow for a precise prediction of long-term alpha, hence a quantifiable prediction can not be provided.  It is crucial to note that long-term investment in this sector requires a thorough analysis of the pharmaceutical industry's future growth prospects.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |

There's a discrepancy in the table (two entries for 2024-11-06).  Assuming the first entry for 2024-11-06 is correct, earnings show significant volatility, with a substantial drop in EPS from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024.  Revenue remains relatively stable but shows no significant upward trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

MRK's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly, showing considerable volatility. While profit margins remain strong, recent earnings data reveals inconsistencies in EPS and revenue growth.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend, with the stock trading below its moving averages and showing an oversold RSI.  The high MDD highlights the investment risk.  Long-term investment decisions should depend on a thorough industry analysis, considering the potential for growth in the pharmaceutical sector despite the current underperformance.  Further investigation is recommended to reconcile the discrepancies in the provided data and to assess the long-term growth prospects of Merck before any investment decision.
