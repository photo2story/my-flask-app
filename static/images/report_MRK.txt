The table shows significant volatility in CAGR and Alpha, indicating periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $89.80
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $92.54

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent small price drop (-$0.01) from the previous close doesn't indicate significant volatility.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

MRK has shown significant underperformance against the S&P 500 in the period reviewed, despite consistently high profit margins and increasing equity.  Current technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, although the stock is in oversold territory. The recent decline in EPS needs investigation.  Despite the current underperformance, the projected long-term return remains positive, suggesting potential for future growth.  Further analysis is necessary to understand the drivers behind the recent earnings decline and to assess the long-term sustainability of MRK's performance relative to the broader market.  The duplicated data points in the earnings report must be clarified.
