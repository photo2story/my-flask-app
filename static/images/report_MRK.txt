* **Closing Price:** $79.17
* **5-day Moving Average:** $79.35
* **20-day Moving Average:** $86.55
* **60-day Moving Average:** $89.85

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent slight price decrease (-$0.01) from the previous close is not significant enough to classify as a sharp drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)  Indicates increased market risk.
* **RSI:** 30.82  Suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO:** -1.10  Confirms bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Divergence:** -11.2%, indicating a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return:** -36.0%  This extremely negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a major red flag.  This strongly suggests significant underperformance is expected.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

MRK shows strong profitability and a large market capitalization. However, its recent performance significantly lags the S&P 500, presenting a considerable negative alpha and high risk as indicated by the high MDD, MRI, and negative expected return. The bearish trend confirmed by moving averages and technical indicators, coupled with a concerning drop in ROE, raises significant concerns.  The provided data suggests MRK is not a strong investment candidate at this time, especially considering the substantial projected underperformance against the S&P 500. Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and the inconsistencies in the provided earnings data is crucial before making any investment decisions.
