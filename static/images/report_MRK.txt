2024-11-24 - Analysis Report
## Merck & Co Inc (MRK) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Merck & Co Inc (MRK) is a leading pharmaceutical company developing and manufacturing medicines and vaccines.  Over the analyzed period, MRK's cumulative return (68.12%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (127.58%). The difference is -59.46%, placing it at the 7.34th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided max/min divergence).  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different time periods. While generally exhibiting a beta close to 1 (meaning similar volatility to the market), its alpha (excess return over the market) has fluctuated between significantly positive and negative values, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance.  The significant negative alpha in the 2019-2021 period is noteworthy.  Cap(B) represents market capitalization in billions of USD and shows growth over the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $99.16
* **5-day Moving Average:** $97.91
* **20-day Moving Average:** $100.37
* **60-day Moving Average:** $108.52

The price is slightly below its 20-day moving average and considerably below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (40.48):**  Approaching oversold territory (generally considered below 30), suggesting potential for a price bounce. However, it's not a strong buy signal on its own.
* **PPO (0.24):** A positive value indicates bullish momentum, but it's relatively low, implying weak momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -12.24%, indicating recent weakness.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0%.  This implies that based on current analysis, long-term investment in MRK is not expected to outperform the S&P 500.  Given the historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500, this forecast is plausible.  The closing price of 99.15 is not significantly unusual in the context of recent price movements, so no significant sudden movements are signaled.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue. While revenue generally shows an upward trend, EPS shows fluctuations.  More detailed information (especially a comparison with analyst estimates and industry benchmarks) is needed for a complete assessment of financial performance.  The duplication of the 2024-11-06 data point needs clarification.

**5.  Financial Information Analysis:**

The data reveals healthy profit margins consistently above 70% over the past year.  However, ROE (Return on Equity) shows significant variability, ranging from a negative value (-3.26% in 2023-12-31) to over 12% in 2024-06-30.  This inconsistency warrants further investigation into the underlying factors driving profitability and equity returns.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

MRK has shown inconsistent performance relative to the S&P 500 over the past few years. While it exhibits healthy profit margins, its variable ROE and lagging performance relative to the market raise concerns. Technical indicators suggest some potential for a short-term price bounce, but the lack of significant outperformance against the market and a neutral expected return casts doubt on the long-term attractiveness of MRK as a growth investment compared to the index fund.  Further research is needed, particularly on the latest news and earnings announcements to fully assess the companyâ€™s current situation.  A comparison to competitor performance within the pharmaceutical industry is also necessary for a complete picture.
