*   **Negative Signals:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, reflected in the large negative divergence and the expected return of -47.6%.

Based on the data provided, MRK presents a mixed investment case. Recent earnings, analyst ratings, and profitability metrics are encouraging. However, the historical underperformance compared to the broader market, as well as the large MDD and negative alpha, cannot be ignored. Investors should carefully weigh these factors before making an investment decision, and perform further due diligence.
