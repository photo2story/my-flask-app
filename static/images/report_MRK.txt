**7. Overall Summary & Conclusion**

MRK's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500, as evidenced by the large negative deviation in cumulative returns and negative Alpha values.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, and the extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.

While analyst consensus remains positive with a "Buy" rating and a notable target price, the conflicting signals from financial performance, technical indicators, and relative performance data create uncertainty. The recent Rothschild & Co Redburn adjustment to $120 from $115 with a 'Buy' rating is a positive.
