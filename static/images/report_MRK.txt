    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The high MDD of 79.6% suggests a significant level of risk and volatility in the projection period.

    *   **Beta:** A Beta of 0.0 indicates that the stock's price is theoretically uncorrelated to the broader market. This seems unusual for a large-cap pharmaceutical company and warrants further investigation (could be an error in the data).
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization is 263.8 Billion.
