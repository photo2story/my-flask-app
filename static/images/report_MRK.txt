**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This is a critical gap in the provided information.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

MRK significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some technical indicators suggest potential short-term recovery (oversold RSI), the long-term outlook appears negative, given the projected underperformance against the S&P 500 and the lack of comprehensive financial data.  The high volatility in both earnings and price movements highlights significant risk.  Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and a more complete set of financial data are necessary for a more robust assessment.  The currently available data presents a cautious outlook for MRK.
