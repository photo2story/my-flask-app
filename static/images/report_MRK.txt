### 7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)

**Summary:**

MRK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Recent news suggests volatility and scrutiny, while the technical indicators are mixed (low MRI, neutral RSI). The financial data shows solid revenue and profit margins, but the extremely negative expected return is a significant red flag.

**Concerns:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:** The large negative divergence from the S&P 500 and negative alpha values are major concerns.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The very negative expected return suggests a potentially poor long-term investment outlook relative to the market.
*   **Recent Volatility:** News indicates recent volatility and potential significant events impacting the company.

**Potential Positives:**

*   **Strong Profit Margins:** The consistently high profit margins are a positive indicator of the company's efficiency.
*   **Low Market Risk (MRI):** The low MRI suggests the stock is not particularly sensitive to overall market risk.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is warranted. The significant underperformance, negative expected return, and recent volatility outweigh the positives of strong profit margins and low market risk. Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and the drivers behind the negative expected return is highly recommended before considering an investment in MRK.
