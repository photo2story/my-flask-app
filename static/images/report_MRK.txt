**1) Return Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **MRK Overview:** Merck & Co. Inc. is a global pharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and marketing of a wide range of healthcare products.
*   **MRK Cumulative Return:** 15.25%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 102.37%
*   **Divergence:** -79.9 (Relative Divergence: 19.0)

**Analysis:**

MRK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return. The divergence is substantial (-79.9), indicating a large gap between MRK's performance and the overall market. The relative divergence of 19.0 suggests that this underperformance is relatively close to the lowest levels seen in the historical range. The "Alpha, Beta analysis" table shows periods of outperformance (positive Alpha) but also significant underperformance (negative Alpha) relative to the market, particularly in recent years. While Beta values are generally low, the recent Beta of 1.7 (2023-2025) suggests increased sensitivity to market movements. This means MRK's price might be more volatile than the market as a whole during this period.
