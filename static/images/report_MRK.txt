## Merck & Co Inc (MRK) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Merck & Co Inc (MRK), a leading pharmaceutical company, based on provided financial and market data.  The analysis covers performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key indicators, earnings, and financial information.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500:**

Merck & Co Inc (MRK) is a leading pharmaceutical company known for its innovative drugs and vaccines.

* **MRK Cumulative Return:** 9.51%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 66.94%
* **Return Difference:** -57.4%  This indicates MRK significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.  The relative divergence of -57.4% places it in the 22.2nd percentile of its historical range (max: 23.9%, min: -80.6%).

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta) and varying degrees of outperformance (Alpha).  While some periods show positive Alpha, indicating outperformance, others reveal significant underperformance.  The market capitalization (Cap) shows consistent growth over the analyzed years.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values in several periods highlight the risk associated with MRK.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $81.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $81.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $90.88

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price change of +$3.75 (from $78.95) indicates a short-term uptick, but the overall picture shows the price is currently trading below its recent averages.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.53 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 22.77 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce)
* **PPO:** -1.25 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.4% (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -34.2% (This suggests significant potential downside risk over the long term relative to the S&P 500)

The high MRI value confirms high market risk. The combination of oversold RSI and negative PPO suggests conflicting signals. The short-term upward trend (as indicated by relative divergence) is at odds with the negative long-term expected return.  The recent price increase of $3.75 could indicate a short-term bounce, but it's too early to confirm a trend reversal.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-11-06 | $1.25 | $16.66B      |
| 2024-08-05 | $2.15 | $16.11B      |
| 2024-05-03 | $1.88 | $15.78B      |

| 2024-11-06 | $1.87 | $15.96B      |


There's a discrepancy in the provided data (two entries for 2024-11-06). Assuming the second 2024-11-06 entry is incorrect, the data shows some volatility in EPS, with a significant drop in the most recent quarter (November 2024). Revenue has remained relatively stable.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reason for the EPS decline.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |

| 2023-12-31 | $14.63B     | 73.26%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity       | ROE           |

Equity has shown consistent growth. ROE displays some volatility but is generally positive, indicating healthy returns on equity.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

MRK's recent performance has been significantly below the S&P 500. While the company exhibits strong profitability and high revenue, recent earnings data shows a concerning drop in EPS.  Technical indicators present conflicting signals, with an oversold RSI suggesting a potential rebound, countered by a negative PPO and a high market risk indicator.  The negative long-term expected return, relative to the S&P 500, presents significant risk for long-term investors.  Further investigation into the reasons for the EPS drop and a more detailed analysis of the market context are necessary for a complete assessment of MRK's investment potential.  The current data suggests caution.
