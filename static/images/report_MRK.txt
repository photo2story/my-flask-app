## Merck & Co Inc (MRK) Stock Review

**0) Overview:** Merck & Co Inc is a leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and manufacturing of innovative medicines and vaccines.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Merck's cumulative return (51.89%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (108.99%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -57.1%, placing it at the 21.1th percentile of the historical range (-85.4% to 48.5%).  This indicates that MRK's performance has lagged behind the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods.  Alpha, representing excess return relative to the market, is generally positive, though sometimes low.  Beta, measuring market sensitivity, is consistently high (above 1), indicating significantly higher volatility than the market.  High beta also implies amplified returns during market upturns but amplified losses during downturns.  The high beta suggests MRK's performance is strongly correlated with the overall market performance.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue          |
|------------|------|-------------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.25 | $16.66 Billion   |
| 2024-08-05 | 2.15 | $16.11 Billion   |
| 2024-05-03 | 1.88 | $15.78 Billion   |
| 2023-11-03 | 1.87 | $15.96 Billion   |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.87 | $15.96 Billion   |


There appears to be an error in the data with duplicate entries for November 2024.  EPS and revenue fluctuate.  A detailed analysis requires understanding the underlying business drivers for these fluctuations.  Further investigation into this variation is needed.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.62B    | 75.50%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $16.66B    | 75.51%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.11B    | 76.76%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $15.78B    | 77.56%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $14.63B    | 73.26%        |

Revenue shows some fluctuation but remains relatively stable. Profit margins are consistently high, showing healthy profitability.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE     |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $46.31B    | 8.08%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $44.50B    | 7.09%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $43.58B    | 12.52%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $40.36B    | 11.80%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $37.58B    | -3.26%  |

Equity is steadily increasing.  ROE is also generally high, with a notable dip in Q4 2023.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for this fluctuation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Merck's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While the company shows high profitability and consistent revenue,  the high beta highlights its sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The recent price action suggests a minor correction, but indicators like RSI and PPO don't suggest strong overbought or oversold conditions.  The high projected long-term expected return needs further justification.  Inconsistencies in the earnings data and the need to investigate fluctuations in ROE require further analysis.  A more comprehensive analysis would require reviewing additional factors like competitor analysis, industry trends, and potential future catalysts for MRK's stock performance.  The data provided suggests a potentially undervalued stock based on expected return, but caution is warranted due to the inherent volatility and need for clarification on several data points.
