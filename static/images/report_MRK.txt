## Merck & Co Inc (MRK) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Merck & Co Inc (MRK) is a leading pharmaceutical company known for its innovative medicines and vaccines.  Over the reviewed period, MRK accumulated a return of 57.74%, exceeding the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 52.12% by 5.62 percentage points.  While this represents a positive outperformance, the relative outperformance (9.2% based on historical min/max variation) suggests that this level of outperformance is not exceptionally high relative to its past performance fluctuations.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different timeframes.  While alpha consistently remains around 1.0, indicating similar performance to the benchmark, the beta value remains consistently around 1.0 suggesting the stock's price movements are closely correlated with the market.  However, the substantial drop in CAGR from 58% to -29% from 2020-2022 to 2023-2025 reveals significant volatility and the impact of external market factors.  Note the high CAGR in the first two periods is not representative of sustained performance, given the significant fall in the last two periods.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | 58.0% | 14.3% | 1.0   | 1.0   | 265.8 |
| 2021-2023  | 55.0% | 14.3% | 1.0   | 1.0   | 268.4 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $95.55
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $96.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $98.92
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $99.66

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term. The recent price change of -$1.12 indicates a slight drop compared to the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 37.80 – Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a short-term bounce.
* **PPO:** -0.43 – A negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -12.7% –  Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 564.7% – This extremely high expected return should be viewed with skepticism.  It likely represents a potential long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this is a projection and not a guaranteed outcome.  It's crucial to understand the assumptions behind this prediction.  It is highly unlikely that MRK will consistently outperform the market by this margin.

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue. While revenue generally shows growth, EPS fluctuates significantly.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

MRK shows a mixed performance picture. While it has historically outperformed the S&P 500 in certain periods with strong revenue and profit margins, recent data reveals volatility in EPS, a downward price trend, and some concerning financial metrics like the negative ROE in Q4 2023. The extremely high projected long-term return requires careful scrutiny and should not be taken at face value.  Further investigation into the drivers of the EPS volatility and the negative ROE is crucial before forming a definitive investment opinion.  A thorough due diligence process, including consideration of the company's competitive landscape, pipeline, and regulatory environment, is necessary.
