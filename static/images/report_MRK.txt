| 2023-2025 | -29.0% | 71.5% | -94.0% | 1.8  | 252.5 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Shows inconsistent growth, with negative CAGR in the most recent periods (2022-2024 and 2023-2025).
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown is high, generally in the 70-80% range, indicating significant price volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is highly variable and recently very negative.  Negative alpha indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark.  The recent -94% alpha is particularly concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta has increased over time. A beta near 1 suggests that MRK's price tends to move with the market. The latest beta of 1.8 is quite high, meaning that the stock is 80% more volatile than market itself.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization is substantial, but has shown some fluctuation.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 101.09
*   **Previous Close:** 100.69
*   **Change:** 0.4
*   **5-day SMA:** 99.898
*   **20-day SMA:** 100.5595
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.8107

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is slightly above the previous close, indicating a small recent gain.
*   The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are close to the current price, suggesting the price is fluctuating around this range.

**3. RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 50.55
*   **PPO:** -0.4883
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (10 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90), Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00), Cash Ratio: 0%
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** 3.1% (단기상승 - short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -52.3%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   An RSI of 50.55 indicates a neutral condition, neither overbought nor oversold.
*   The negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, which can be a bearish signal.
*   Despite the Hybrid Signal indicating a buy, the extremely negative expected return (-52.3%) is very concerning and suggests significant downside risk based on the models used.
*   The recent short-term increase in relative divergence might be a temporary rebound.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Trump Drug-Pricing Deal:** News mentions drug-pricing bargains with Trump, which could impact future revenue.
*   **Stock Discount:**  An article suggests MRK is cheaper now.
*   **Dividend Increase:**  MRK has increased its dividend.
*   **Shares Sold by Perpetual Ltd:** Institutional selling can sometimes indicate a lack of confidence.
*   **Surging Stock:** An older article discusses why Merck stock was surging (likely related to specific events at that time).

**Analysis:**

*   The news is mixed. The potential impact of drug pricing deals is uncertain but could affect revenue. The dividend increase is positive for investors.  The institutional selling and negative expected return are causes for concern.
*   The analyst consensus and target prices should be viewed cautiously in light of the negative expected return and recent negative performance.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.90)
*   **Opinions:** 26
*   **Target Price:** 110.04 (Avg), 139.00 (High), 83.00 (Low)

**Analysis:**

*   Analysts generally have a positive outlook (Buy consensus).
*   The average target price is higher than the current price, suggesting potential upside *according to analysts*. However, this conflicts sharply with the model's expected return.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** MRK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** High Maximum Drawdown indicates a volatile stock.
*   **Alpha:** Very negative alpha is concerning and implies significant underperformance against a benchmark.
*   **Mixed Signals:** News items are mixed, with potential headwinds from drug pricing offsetting positive aspects like dividend increases.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The model projects a substantial negative expected return (-52.3%), which raises serious concerns. This is a major red flag.
*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Model Pessimism:** While analysts have a "Buy" consensus and higher target prices, the model's extremely negative expected return suggests that the stock may be overvalued or facing significant challenges not fully captured by analyst estimates.
*   **Financial Strength:** The company demonstrates financial strength with high profit margins, increasing equity, and improving ROE.

**Conclusion:**

MRK presents a complex picture. While the company exhibits financial strength and analysts are generally positive, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the concerning negative alpha, and especially the extremely negative expected return from the model warrant considerable caution. The divergence between analyst sentiment and the model's projection is substantial and should be investigated further. Given the current data, a neutral or even slightly negative outlook might be warranted until the reasons for the negative expected return can be better understood.
