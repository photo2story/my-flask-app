    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows fluctuating performance.  Recent periods (2022-2025) exhibit negative growth.
    *   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown percentages suggest significant volatility and potential for losses during specific periods.
    *   **Alpha:**  Alpha, representing performance relative to a benchmark, is largely negative, indicating underperformance compared to the market. The -90% Alpha for 2023-2025 is particularly concerning.
    *   **Beta:** Beta, measuring volatility relative to the market, is generally low but increases significantly in the most recent period (2023-2025). A Beta of 1.8 indicates that MRK's price is now more volatile than the overall market.
    *   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization of MRK shows an increasing trend during the given time, however, it decreased recently (2022-2024).

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $106.78
*   **Moving Averages:** The rising moving averages (5-day > 20-day > 60-day) indicate a recent upward trend in the stock price. The price is above all three SMAs.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A Market Risk Indicator of 1.0 suggests a "High Investment Recommended" rating, which contradicts other negative indicators.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 71.04 suggests the stock is currently overbought, potentially indicating a possible pullback in the near future.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.31 indicates that the 12-period moving average is above the 26-period moving average, suggesting a short-term upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying 100% of available cash (2 shares), labeling it "Very Safe". This recommendation is driven by the high MRI, which should be viewed cautiously given other negative indicators.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** A positive change of 1.3 in recent relative divergence suggests a short-term increase in the stock's performance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** A significantly negative expected return of -47.6% compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon is a major red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news articles present a mixed outlook:
