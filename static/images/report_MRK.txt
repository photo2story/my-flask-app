**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR & MDD:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates, with some periods showing strong growth (e.g., 2016-2019) and others significant decline (e.g., 2023-2025). The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, representing the excess return relative to the market, is highly variable. Recent periods (2023-2025) show significantly negative alpha, suggesting underperformance compared to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta generally remains below 1, except for the last period, indicating lower systematic risk than the overall market historically, but it has recently increased.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has been fluctuating, with a decline in recent years.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 84.70
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 83.92, Previous Close: 84.11, Change: -0.23
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 85.87
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 83.95
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 83.33

**Analysis:**  The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average but above the 20 and 60-day moving averages. This suggests potential short-term downward pressure, but overall the stock is trading above its medium-term trend lines. The last market data showing a small decline reinforces this short-term bearish signal.

**3. Indicators & Signals**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 62.36 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.06 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (35 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90).  Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01).
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** -3.2 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -113.0 (Long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**  The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI approaching 70 could signal overbought conditions, potentially preceding a pullback. However, the PPO indicates upward momentum. The hybrid signal suggests a "Buy" recommendation, contradicting with other information. The negative change in relative spread and the very negative expected return indicate caution. The small price change in the "Last-market" data doesn't suggest any major volatile issues.
