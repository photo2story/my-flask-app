## Merck & Co Inc (MRK) Stock Performance Review

**0. Overview:**

Merck & Co Inc is a leading pharmaceutical company.  This report analyzes its recent performance against the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **MRK Cumulative Return:** 22.89%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 82.57%
* **Return Difference:** -59.7%  (MRK underperformed VOO significantly)
* **Relative Divergence:** 19.3% (Indicates MRK's underperformance is relatively lower than the minimum divergence observed historically within the given dataset).  The relative divergence is calculated based on the historical range of divergence between MRK and VOO.  A higher relative divergence indicates a larger gap between MRK and VOO's performance compared to their historical range.

The provided Alpha and Beta data reveals inconsistent performance relative to the S&P 500. While periods of high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) are observed, they are accompanied by substantial maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The relatively high Beta values (mostly above 0.1) indicate considerable sensitivity to market fluctuations. The relatively small alpha values suggest that MRK's performance is largely driven by market movements, rather than unique company-specific factors.


**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 10.0% | 58.6% | -22.0% | 0.1 | 108.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 49.0% | 66.4% | 27.0% | 0.4 | 151.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 48.0% | 66.4% | 14.0% | 0.9 | 185.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 26.0% | 66.4% | -4.0% | 0.7 | 172.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 4.0% | 65.6% | -56.0% | 0.5 | 175.4 |
| 2020-2022  | 20.0% | 69.3% | 11.0% | 0.5 | 262.1 |
| 2021-2023  | 43.0% | 69.3% | 22.0% | 0.3 | 264.8 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $79.84
* **5-day Moving Average:** $78.68
* **20-day Moving Average:** $81.72
* **60-day Moving Average:** $87.80

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend. The recent price increase of 1.4 from the previous close suggests a slight recovery, but it's still important to consider the overall trend relative to the averages.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.91 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.1194 (Slightly positive, suggesting a potential bullish signal, but weak)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -16.6% (Negative expected return relative to the benchmark, indicating potential underperformance.  Further context regarding the calculation method of this figure is needed.)

The price change of 1.4 is not considered a significant upward spike. The combination of a medium market risk, relatively low RSI, and a negative expected return suggests caution.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 (B$) |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.25 | 16.66 |
| 2024-08-05 | 2.15 | 16.11 |
| 2024-05-03 | 1.88 | 15.78 |
| 2023-11-03 | 1.87 | 15.96 |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.87 | 15.96 |


There appears to be a duplicate entry for November 6th, 2024.  EPS fluctuates and shows a decline in the most recent quarter. Revenue is relatively stable but not showing strong growth.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes of these fluctuations.  Comparison with previous years' earnings would provide valuable context.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin (%) |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.62  | 75.50 |
| 2024-09-30 | $16.66  | 75.51 |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.11  | 76.76 |
| 2024-03-31 | $15.78  | 77.56 |
| 2023-12-31 | $14.63  | 73.26 |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $46.31 | 8.08 |
| 2024-09-30 | $44.50 | 7.09 |
| 2024-06-30 | $43.58 | 12.52 |
| 2024-03-31 | $40.36 | 11.80 |
| 2023-12-31 | $37.58 | -3.26 |


Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains relatively stable. Profit margins are high and consistently above 70%, indicating good profitability.  Equity is increasing, and ROE (Return on Equity) is generally positive, although it fluctuates.  The negative ROE in 2023-12-31 warrants further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

MRK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While the company demonstrates high profit margins, recent earnings show some volatility and a decline in EPS.  Technical indicators suggest a possible downward trend, although the RSI is not definitively in oversold territory.  The negative expected return further underscores the potential for continued underperformance.  A deeper dive into the factors driving the recent EPS decline and a comparison of current financial metrics against historical trends and industry benchmarks are crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.  The high Beta suggests that market sentiment will greatly impact the future price of the stock.  Given the current data, a long-term investment in MRK is risky and may not outperform the S&P 500.
