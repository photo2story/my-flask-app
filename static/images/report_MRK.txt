**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $78.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $79.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $85.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $89.54

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the moving averages indicates potential for further price decline or a significant reversal. The recent price change of -$0.99 reflects a short-term decline.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 29.07 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.98 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -12.6% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -35.8% (This suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years).  This number should be interpreted cautiously as expected returns are inherently uncertain)

The technical indicators paint a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests potential for a price bounce due to oversold conditions, the negative PPO and the negative relative divergence signal bearish momentum. The large negative expected return highlights the substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 projection.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.25 | $16.66B       |
| 2024-08-05 | 2.15 | $16.11B       |
| 2024-05-03 | 1.88 | $15.78B       |
| 2023-11-03 | 1.87 | $15.96B       |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.87 | $15.96B       |

There appears to be a duplicated entry for November 2024.  Excluding the duplication, revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains consistent. EPS is volatile, exhibiting a significant drop in the most recent quarter (Nov 2024). Further investigation into the reasons for this EPS decline is necessary.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.62B    | 75.50%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $16.66B    | 75.51%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $16.11B    | 76.76%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $15.78B    | 77.56%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $14.63B    | 73.26%        |

Revenue shows relatively stable performance. Profit margins remain high and consistent, although there is a slight decrease in the most recent quarter.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE     |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $46.31B    | 8.08%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $44.50B    | 7.09%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $43.58B    | 12.52% |
| 2024-03-31 | $40.36B    | 11.80% |
| 2023-12-31 | $37.58B    | -3.26% |

Equity is increasing steadily, indicating growth in the company's capital base. ROE is also generally positive and strong, with a noticeable dip in the last quarter of 2023.  The recent quarters show a decrease in ROE, which warrants further investigation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

MRK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the provided period. While the company exhibits healthy revenue and profit margins, recent quarterly earnings show a concerning drop in EPS and ROE. Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but overall momentum is bearish.  The substantial negative expected return casts doubt on the long-term prospects of outperforming the broader market, at least based on the current data and projections.  Further research is recommended to understand the reasons behind the recent decline in EPS and ROE and to assess whether the current price presents a compelling buying opportunity.  The inconsistency in performance demonstrated by the alpha and beta analysis throughout the years requires further scrutiny.
