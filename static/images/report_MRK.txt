*   **Gardasil Concerns:** Potential weakness in Gardasil sales needs to be monitored.
*   **Volatility:** The recent price action and the divergence from the S&P 500 suggest increased volatility.
*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Reality:**  The significant difference between the current price and the average analyst target price suggests that analysts believe the company is undervalued, but the negative expected return raises serious concerns.

**Recommendation:**

Given the negative expected return and recent underperformance, a cautious approach is warranted. Further research is needed to understand the reasons behind the negative outlook and whether the company can turn things around. While analyst ratings are positive, the data suggests significant risks.
