## Merck & Co Inc (MRK) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Merck & Co Inc (MRK), a leading pharmaceutical company, by examining its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, financial indicators, and recent earnings. Key figures are presented first, followed by a detailed analysis.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Merck & Co Inc (MRK) is a global healthcare company engaged in the discovery, development, and manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and vaccines.

* **MRK Cumulative Return:** 22.65%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 78.93%
* **Return Difference:** -56.3% (MRK underperformed VOO significantly)
* **Relative Divergence:** 22.5% (This indicates MRK's underperformance is in the lower 22.5% range of historical divergences between the two.  It's not a direct measure of future performance, but a contextualization of the current underperformance.)

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and beta (volatility relative to the market) values over the years.  While positive alpha values indicate periods of outperformance, the overall trend suggests that MRK's performance has been significantly below the market benchmark (VOO) in recent years, consistent with the cumulative return difference.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values in several years reflect periods of substantial price declines.

MRK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, exhibiting a considerable negative alpha.

A thorough review of the inconsistent earnings data and a deeper dive into the reasons for underperformance against the market benchmark are necessary for a complete investment decision.  Further research into specific drivers of the company's performance and the current market environment would be beneficial for formulating a well-informed investment strategy.  The high MDD values across several periods should also be factored into any investment assessment as indicators of potential risk.
