**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $91.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $87.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $90.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.64

The price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent price increase but still some distance from its recent high. The 1.98% daily increase from the previous close indicates a positive short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.18 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory)
* **PPO:** 0.48 (Positive value indicates upward momentum, but close to zero)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +13.7% (Suggests short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 45.6% (This represents a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term, but requires further investigation for validation).

The recent price increase (1.98%) and positive PPO and relative divergence suggest positive momentum in the short term. However, the low RSI value indicates the potential for further downward movement before any significant price appreciation. The significant expected return should be treated cautiously and further research and modeling are required.
