*   **Merck Stock Rise as New PAH Drug Winrevair Meets Goal in Another Study:**  This is a significant positive catalyst driving recent price increases.

**Analysis:**

Recent news is mixed.  The Winrevair study results are a positive catalyst explaining the recent jump. However, the insider selling, negative expected return, and cautionary notes from analysts indicate underlying concerns. The rejection of the mini-tender offer is neutral but worth noting.
