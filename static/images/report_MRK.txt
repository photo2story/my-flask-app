**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Merck (MRK) has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the given period. While the company demonstrates generally strong revenue and profit margins, inconsistencies in EPS, ROE volatility, and recent price declines raise concerns. The relatively low RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, but the negative PPO and the larger-scale underperformance relative to the market indicate a need for further investigation into the underlying factors affecting MRK's performance before making any investment decisions.  The expected long-term return of 12.7% over the S&P 500 is positive, but the considerable recent price drop and the need to clarify some data inconsistencies needs to be addressed. A deeper dive into news, upcoming drug approvals or potential regulatory changes could provide more context.
