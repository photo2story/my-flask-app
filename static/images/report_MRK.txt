*   **Divergence Change:** The positive change in relative divergence indicates recent short-term outperformance *relative* to its historical underperformance against the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** A negative expected return of -52.3% is a major red flag. It suggests that, based on current analysis, the stock is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the next two years.

*   **Volatility:** The stock's maximum drawdown (MDD) is high.
*   **Technical Signals:** While the RSI suggests it may be approaching oversold conditions, the negative expected return of -52.3% is concerning.
