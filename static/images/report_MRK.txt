| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 10.0% | 58.6% | -22.0% | 0.1 | 108.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 49.0% | 66.4% | 27.0% | 0.4 | 151.9 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of $78.00 is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a potential downward trend.  The price increased slightly from the previous close, indicating a minor price rebound after a recent period of decline.  The increase, however, is not substantial enough to signal a significant trend reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 27.13 indicates that the stock is currently oversold, suggesting a potential bounce. However, the negative PPO (-0.78) indicates bearish momentum. The recent increase in relative divergence (+2.0) suggests a short-term upward movement but needs to be viewed in the context of the negative long term returns relative to the S&P 500. The expected return of -11.7% relative to the S&P 500 over the long term signals significant underperformance.  Given the recent price increase ('change': 2.01), there's some indication of a mild rebound, but not a strong reversal of the downward trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue. There is inconsistency in the reporting. The 2024-11-06 entry appears duplicated.  A more detailed analysis requires consistent and complete data.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.25 | 16.66 B$ |
| 2024-08-05 | 2.15 | 16.11 B$ |

| 2024-11-06 | 1.87 | 15.96 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable in recent quarters, though there's some quarterly fluctuation. Profit margins are generally high and consistent, showcasing profitability.  Equity has been increasing steadily, and ROE shows a mixed picture with periods of strong profitability and periods of negative returns. Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying drivers of these fluctuations.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $15.62B | 75.50% |
| 2024-09-30 | $16.66B | 75.51% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

MRK's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly. While the company demonstrates strong profitability and consistent revenue, its stock price has underperformed the market. The recent price movement shows signs of a possible short-term bounce from oversold conditions, but the negative PPO and long-term expected underperformance signal caution.  A thorough investigation into the reasons behind the underperformance, coupled with a deeper analysis of earnings data and future prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current data suggests that despite high profitability, MRK is currently not a strong investment relative to the market.  Further analysis is needed to clarify the discrepancies in the earnings data.
