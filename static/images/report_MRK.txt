**7. 종합 분석**

Based on the provided information, here's a summary assessment of MRK:

*   **Price Trend:** Recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend.
*   **Risk Assessment:** MRI indicates "Low Risk," but the high MDD values from Alpha,Beta Analysis suggests high historical risk of losses.
*   **Technical Indicators:** RSI suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory.
*   **Financial Health:** The company appears to be financially stable with high profit margins.
*   **News:** Recent news suggests the company is experiencing significant changes and volatility.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data paints a mixed picture. The significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and concerning alpha values are red flags.  However, the potentially oversold RSI, recent positive movement in the relative deviation, and high future return could indicate the start of a turn-around.  Investors should proceed with caution and carefully monitor company announcements, industry trends, and global economic factors before making any investment decisions. Considering the overall mixed indicators, **the data would not support a strong buy recommendation at this time.**
