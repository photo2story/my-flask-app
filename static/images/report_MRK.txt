The lack of a positive long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500, combined with the need for further information on recent news and financial reports, makes it difficult to recommend a specific investment strategy.  More detailed analysis and consideration of individual risk tolerance are crucial before making any investment decisions. Further research into future growth drivers, pipeline developments, and competitive landscape is essential to formulating a well-informed opinion.  The fluctuating ROE and the need to clarify the variability in the EPS and its relation to the revenue warrant a thorough examination of the financial statements.
