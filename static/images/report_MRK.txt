**7) 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

MRK has shown recent upward price momentum, supported by its current price being above its moving averages and a positive change in the last market session. However, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, as evidenced by the large negative divergence in cumulative returns.

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. The RSI is nearing overbought levels, suggesting a potential pullback. The PPO is positive, supporting the short-term uptrend, and the Hybrid Signal indicates a cautious buy recommendation. However, the most concerning factor is the highly negative expected return, which suggests that the stock is expected to underperform the S&P 500 significantly in the long term.

Recent news highlights volatility and ongoing analyst discussion, which could be related to regulatory changes, market events, earnings reports, or executive actions. Earnings and financial data indicate consistent revenue and high-profit margins, along with steady equity growth. However, ROE has fluctuated. The recent decline in revenue relative to the previous quarter, combined with the negative expected return, raises concerns.

**In conclusion:** While there are some positive short-term indicators, the long-term outlook for MRK appears challenging, particularly given the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the extremely negative expected return. Investors should proceed with caution and carefully evaluate the underlying factors driving the stock's recent volatility and potential future performance.
