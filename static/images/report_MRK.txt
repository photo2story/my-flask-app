**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

MRK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analysed, exhibiting a negative alpha and fluctuating beta. While recent price action shows the stock is currently trading below its moving averages, and the RSI suggests oversold conditions, this needs more context and data to solidify this.  Earnings results have shown inconsistent performance, with a notable drop in EPS in the latest quarter.  The provided financial data also indicates volatility in profitability and return on equity.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits a full assessment.  Further research into the causes of the negative ROE and the drop in EPS, along with a more complete market outlook is needed for a comprehensive investment decision.

Based solely on the limited provided data, MRK's outlook remains unclear. While some indicators suggest potential short-term buying opportunities (oversold RSI), the long-term underperformance relative to the market and inconsistent financial results raise significant concerns.
