## Merck & Co Inc (MRK) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Merck & Co Inc (MRK) is a leading pharmaceutical company.  Over the period analyzed, MRK's cumulative return of 69.31% significantly lagged the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 126.85%, resulting in a difference of -57.54%.  This places MRK's performance at the 9.01% percentile relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500, based on the provided min/max range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results. While CAGR has been positive in most periods, Alpha values have generally declined over time, suggesting underperformance relative to the market.  Beta values indicate varying levels of market sensitivity, ranging from high (0.9) to low (0.3).  This fluctuation in both Alpha and Beta suggests that MRK's correlation with the overall market has not been consistent.  Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values highlight periods of significant risk, with a high of 83.3% in 2019-2021.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $99.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $97.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $100.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $108.81

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 20-day moving average implies that the short-term downward pressure might be easing.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (42.54):**  Approaching oversold territory (below 50), suggesting potential for a bounce. However, itâ€™s not definitively a buy signal.
* **PPO (0.1):**  A positive value indicates bullish momentum, although the value is relatively close to zero.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-13.29):** Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided data projects no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), given current market conditions.

The closing price of $99.85 is close to the 20-day moving average, so there isn't a strong indication of a rapid upward or downward movement.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data show some volatility.  While revenue remains relatively stable around the $16B mark, EPS fluctuates significantly.  More detailed analysis including earnings estimates and comparisons to previous years and competitor data is needed for a thorough assessment.  The provided data alone doesn't allow for conclusions about trend strength.  Note that the 2024-11-06 data entry appears duplicated.

**5. Financial Information (Revenue & Profitability and Capital & Profitability):**

The revenue and profitability data show consistently high profit margins (73-77%).  However, Return on Equity (ROE) has fluctuated, including a negative value in Q4 2023, indicating a period of underperformance in terms of shareholder return.  Further investigation is needed to ascertain the reasons behind this variability and to compare these figures to industry benchmarks.

**7. Summary:**

MRK's performance has lagged the S&P 500, though the recent downward trend seems to be easing. Technical indicators suggest potential for a bounce, but they are not definitive signals. Financial data shows strong profit margins but fluctuating ROE and volatile EPS, requiring further analysis.  News and analyst opinions (to be added from external sources) will provide further context for investment decisions.  The projected long-term expected return is currently low relative to the S&P 500.  A comprehensive analysis, including a more detailed examination of the company's specific product pipeline, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors, is needed before any investment decision is made.
