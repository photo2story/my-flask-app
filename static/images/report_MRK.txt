**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values for different periods suggest that MRK consistently exhibited a negative alpha (-0.1), indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The beta values are around 0.1, which is significantly lower than 1 implying low market sensitivity.

It's crucial to consider these figures in the context of the broader market conditions during each timeframe.  The consistent negative alpha requires further investigation to identify underlying causes.
