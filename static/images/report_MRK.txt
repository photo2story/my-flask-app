* **20-day Moving Average:** $90.73
* **60-day Moving Average:** $96.76

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (30.99):** Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
* **PPO (0.036):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although it is relatively weak.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):**  The positive change in relative strength (+10.8%) indicates a recent period of outperformance compared to the market.


The predicted 60.2% expected return over the long term (2+ years) significantly outpaces the anticipated S&P 500 return, implying substantial potential for outperformance.  However, this prediction should be viewed with caution given the uncertainty associated with long-term market forecasts.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data show some volatility in EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally shows an upward trend, EPS has shown fluctuation, requiring further investigation into underlying drivers such as changing product sales mix or increased costs.  Note that the 2024-11-06 data point appears duplicated.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.25 | 16.66 B$ |

**5. Financial Information:**

However, the Return on Equity (ROE) shows significant fluctuation, possibly reflecting changes in capital structure or investment strategies.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying causes of these variations.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

MRK's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly in the recent past, despite generally strong financial fundamentals.  While the stock currently sits in oversold territory (RSI), indicating potential upside, the recent price action and moving averages suggest a bearish trend.  The high predicted long-term expected return is promising, but carries substantial uncertainty.  Further investigation is needed into the drivers of fluctuating EPS and ROE, as well as a deeper analysis of the company's future prospects and pipeline to gain a more complete understanding of its investment potential.  A comprehensive review of competitive landscape and industry trends is also vital before making any investment decision.
