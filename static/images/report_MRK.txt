MRK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, although the long-term expected return is high.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but bearish momentum is present.  Earnings and financial data show some volatility, requiring further analysis to understand the underlying trends.  The high beta suggests significant market risk.  A thorough due diligence process, considering company-specific factors and broader market conditions, is essential before making any investment decisions.  The high projected long-term return should be approached with skepticism without a deep dive into its underlying assumptions and the model's limitations.  Consider seeking professional financial advice.
