**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Data:** No recent earnings news from sources like Shacknews or Finbold is explicitly provided,  limiting the ability to comment on current market sentiment and recent analyst opinions.

**7. Summary of Analysis:**

MRK has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly in the given period, showing a considerable negative divergence. While some technical indicators like the RSI suggest potential oversold conditions, the negative PPO and recent relative divergence indicate bearish momentum. Financial data showcases stable high revenue with fluctuating EPS and ROE.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a comprehensive evaluation of market sentiment and future outlook. More data, particularly detailed earnings reports with expectations, and recent news analysis, are needed for a more conclusive assessment.  Current information leans toward caution.


**8. Recommendations:**

Due to the limitations of the provided data (specifically the lack of recent news and analyst opinions), it's impossible to provide specific investment recommendations. Before making any investment decisions regarding MRK, conducting thorough due diligence, including reviewing recent news, analyst reports (like those from Finbold), SEC filings, and consulting with a financial advisor, is essential.  The current data suggests a period of underperformance relative to the market, and more investigation is warranted before considering an investment.
