## AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Stock Analysis Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) is a theatrical exhibition company operating numerous movie theaters worldwide.  The company has shown significant volatility and underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over recent periods.


**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

* **AMC Cumulative Return:** -80.93%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 84.00%
* **Return Difference:** -164.9%  This indicates a substantial underperformance of AMC compared to the S&P 500.  The relative divergence of -1.8 indicates that the current performance is near the lower end of the historical range of divergence between AMC and the VOO.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows significant volatility and inconsistent performance. While periods of high positive returns (255% CAGR from 2019-2021) were observed, these were followed by substantial negative returns, highlighting the high risk associated with this investment.  The high beta values (often exceeding 48) suggest significant sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $2.72
* **Last Market Price:** $2.68 (Change: -$0.04, -1.47%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $2.71
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $2.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $3.03

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend.  The recent price drop of 1.47% reflects a small, but still negative movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.379 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 48.28 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.4  (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -4334.6% This extremely negative expected return highlights the substantial risk involved, indicating that the current model predicts significantly lower returns than the benchmark.  This should be interpreted with caution, as such extremely low values are often unreliable.  Long-term investment (2+ years) may offer diversification benefits, but the extreme negative forecast strongly suggests very low chances of outperforming the S&P 500.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

AMC exhibits high volatility and substantial risk. While it has shown periods of strong growth, its recent performance significantly lags behind the S&P 500, and the negative equity raises serious concerns about its financial stability.  Technical indicators suggest a short-term downtrend, and the extremely negative projected return highlights the considerable risk associated with this stock.  The consistently high profit margins are a positive factor, but the negative equity and significant underperformance compared to the market outweigh this positive aspect.  Further investigation into the discrepancies in the earnings data and a thorough review of the company's financial health are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment strategy would require a high-risk tolerance and careful consideration of the inherent volatility of this stock.
