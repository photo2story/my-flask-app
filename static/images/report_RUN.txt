## Sunrun Inc. (RUN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Sunrun Inc. (RUN), a leading residential solar energy services company, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While the S&P 500 showed a cumulative return of 120.77%, RUN experienced a cumulative loss of -17.09%. This represents a considerable divergence of -137.86%, placing it at the 0.55 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  The provided alpha and beta values indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements (beta consistently above 1), with periods of significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  The large negative CAGR in some periods further underscores this volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last market close, RUN's share price was $9.87.  The stock price is currently below its 5-day ($10.21), 20-day ($12.98), and 60-day ($16.42) moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (31.87):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-2.64):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-1.41):** Shows a recent downward trend in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided expected return is zero, meaning no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated at this time, at least in the short term.  The long-term (2+ years) outlook with consistent investment is unclear and would depend on the companyâ€™s ability to overcome current challenges and return to profitability. The divergence from the market suggests increased risk, and therefore this 0% expected return is arguably a conservative estimate.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

RUN's recent financial performance shows significant volatility. While some quarters show positive EPS and revenue growth, others reveal substantial losses.  The most recent earnings ($-0.37 EPS, $0.54B Revenue) fall short of expectations, and requires a comprehensive review of the company's financial statements and forecasts to gain a complete picture.   The discrepancy between the EPS reported on 2024-11-07 and earlier reports requires clarification.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable over the past year. However, profit margins show significant fluctuation, indicating challenges in managing costs and achieving consistent profitability. The significant drop in profitability in Q4 2023 is concerning.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  The Return on Equity (ROE) is highly volatile and frequently negative, indicating concerns regarding the efficiency of capital utilization.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Sunrun Inc. (RUN) is currently facing headwinds.  The stock's significant underperformance against the S&P 500, coupled with volatile financial results and negative technical indicators, presents a cautious outlook. While the oversold RSI might suggest potential for a short-term rebound, the fundamental weakness and persistent losses raise serious concerns.  The lack of a clear positive growth trajectory, combined with a high beta, makes it a high-risk investment.  Further analysis of recent news and analyst opinions, along with a detailed evaluation of the company's long-term strategic plans and capacity for sustainable profitability, is critical before making any investment decision. The high volatility and high beta suggest this stock is not suitable for risk-averse investors.  It also needs more investigation into the reason for the large variations in financial performance.

**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, RUN presents a high-risk investment.  The significant underperformance relative to the market, volatile financial results, and negative technical indicators paint a bearish picture. While the oversold conditions might offer a short-term opportunity, the underlying fundamental weaknesses require thorough investigation before any investment decision. More information is needed on the cause of the inconsistencies in the financials.  The lack of a robust growth story warrants cautious optimism. Further research into the recent news, analyst ratings and the specifics of the most recent earnings report are needed for a proper evaluation.
