The data shows significant volatility and negative alpha in earlier periods, suggesting underperformance relative to the market benchmark. However, recent periods exhibit strong positive CAGR and improving alpha, indicating potential market outperformance. The near-zero beta suggests limited correlation with the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $8.67
* **Last Market Price:** $8.73
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $8.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $8.68
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $7.42

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it's still below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.  The recent price increase (from $8.67 to $8.73) is relatively minor and doesn't indicate a significant price surge.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.08 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.92 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.2 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -47.5% (Significantly below the S&P 500)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While short-term momentum is positive, the negative PPO and significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggest caution. The recent small price increase doesn't drastically alter the overall outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue   |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2024-11-06 | -$0.21| $0.00 B   |
| 2024-08-08 | -$0.18| $0.00 B   |
| 2024-05-08 | -$0.14| $0.00 B   |
| 2023-11-06 | $0   | $0.00 B   |
| 2024-11-06 | $0   | $0.00 B   |

The company is currently reporting consistent losses with zero revenue. This is a significant concern and a major factor contributing to the negative outlook.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.00B | 46.43%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.00B | 46.43%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.00B | 40.00%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity  | ROE      |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.78B | -18.42%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.89B | -13.78%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.98B | -9.70%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $1.03B | -11.13%  |
| 2023-09-30 | $1.11B | 0.14%    |

Zero revenue despite a high profit margin is paradoxical and requires further investigation. The negative ROE consistently indicates the company is not generating returns on its equity.  This is a serious red flag.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

JOBY shows significant potential in the burgeoning eVTOL market. However, currently, the company is facing serious challenges.  Persistent losses, zero revenue, and negative ROE paint a concerning picture. While short-term price movements might show some positive signs, the long-term outlook is significantly hampered by the lack of profitability and revenue generation. The high negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 further underscores the significant risk associated with this investment.  Further investigation into the reasons for zero revenue despite reported profit margin and a deeper analysis of the company's long-term strategy and projected timelines for profitability are crucial before considering any investment.
