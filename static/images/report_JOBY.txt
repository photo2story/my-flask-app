**Alpha/Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -58.0%   | 71.6% | -53.0%   | -0.0   | 2.9    |
| 2021-2023  | -22.0%   | 71.6% | -40.0%   | -0.0   | 5.7    |
| 2022-2024  | 59.0%    | 74.7% | 34.0%    | -0.0   | 7.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 107.0%   | 74.7% | 48.0%    | -0.1   | 14.2   |

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate shows highly variable performance across different periods. Recent years (2023-2025) show substantial growth (107%), while earlier periods (2020-2022) show significant losses (-58%).
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high (around 70%+) across all periods, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is also highly variable. While the most recent period (2023-2025) shows positive alpha (48%), the earlier periods are significantly negative. This means that, recently, JOBY has outperformed what its beta would predict, but historically, it has significantly underperformed.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is consistently near zero or slightly negative. Beta measures volatility, and a value around or less than 0 indicates JOBY's price moves are uncorrelated to the S&P 500. This is unusual, as most stocks are positively correlated with the market. It might suggest that JOBY's performance is driven by company-specific news and events rather than broader market trends.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has increased over time, reflecting the company's growth and investor interest.

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 14.06
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 14.81

*   **Analysis:**

    *   The stock price is trading above all its short-term and medium-term moving averages, which is generally considered bullish. However, the last market price shows a significant drop (-4.34%), indicating recent selling pressure.

*   **20-Day Relative Spread Change:** 4.0 (Positive - Short-Term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -29.0% (Long-Term)

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests a low-risk environment, which is a positive signal.
    *   **RSI:** The high RSI value indicates the stock is currently overbought, suggesting a potential pullback or consolidation in the near term.
    *   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests upward price momentum.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying with caution, which reflects the mixed signals from the indicators.
    *   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** The positive change in relative spread suggests short-term positive momentum relative to the S&P 500.
    *   **Last Market Price Change:** The negative change of -4.34% should be considered.
    *   **Expected Return:** The negative expected return of -29.0% (vs. S&P 500) for long-term investment is a significant red flag. This indicates that the model predicts JOBY will underperform the S&P 500 over the next two years.

*   **Summary:** Joby Aviation is a high-risk, high-reward stock in the emerging eVTOL market. It has shown significant volatility and is heavily reliant on future growth expectations rather than current financial performance.
*   **Key Positives:**
    *   Strong recent price momentum.

*   **Recommendation:** Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted. The recent price surge, combined with the overbought RSI and negative expected return, suggests that the stock may be due for a correction. The success of Joby Aviation depends on the successful development and commercialization of its eVTOL technology, which is inherently uncertain.
