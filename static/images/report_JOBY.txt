Joby Aviation Inc. (JOBY) is an electric air taxi company developing and commercializing all-electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.

As of the last data point, JOBY's cumulative return is -12.99%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 66.92%.  This represents a significant divergence of -79.91%.  The relative divergence of -11.0% indicates that JOBY's performance is considerably below the S&P 500, falling within the lower 11% of its historical performance range relative to the index.

Negative CAGR across all periods demonstrates significant underperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $5.73
* **5-day Moving Average:** $6.03
* **20-day Moving Average:** $5.48
* **60-day Moving Average:** $5.35

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend. However, it sits above the 60-day moving average indicating some relative support.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.65 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.47 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although it's relatively low.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.2 – Indicates short-term upward momentum in relative strength.


The current price of $5.73 doesn't immediately signal a dramatic surge or crash based solely on this information; however, given the negative trends, a further downward move is a plausible scenario.  The expected return is 0.0%, implying that the long-term (2+ years) investment in JOBY is not expected to outperform the S&P 500.  This is consistent with the historical data.


**4. Recent Financial Performance & Outlook:**

The provided financial data reveals consistently negative EPS and zero revenue across reported periods.  This indicates the company is currently not generating profits and likely operating at a loss.  Without an earnings estimate for the most recent period,  a proper assessment of the current performance against expectations is impossible. The lack of revenue is concerning and requires further investigation into the company's operational and strategic plans.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial statements show troubling trends:

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Consistently zero revenue and a high, but misleading, profit margin given the zero revenue.  This suggests that profits are largely accounting adjustments and not from actual revenue generating activity.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Decreasing equity and negative ROE (Return on Equity) point to significant financial challenges and potential issues with profitability.  The company appears to be burning cash.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires real-time data.  Please provide recent news articles or links for a complete analysis.  I will incorporate that information here once provided.

I'll need information from sources like FINBOLD, Shacknews, etc. to provide this section.


**7.  Overall Summary:**

JOBY is currently experiencing significant financial challenges, showing consistent losses and zero revenue. The stock price reflects this poor performance, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. While some short-term technical indicators suggest a potential positive movement, the overall fundamental picture is negative.  The lack of profitability and the continued reliance on funding raise significant long-term concerns.  Further investigation into their operational strategies and technology development progress is crucial before considering any investment.  The expected return of 0% relative to the S&P 500 underscores this risky investment.  Investors should approach JOBY with extreme caution, given the considerable financial risks.
