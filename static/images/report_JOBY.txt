*   **Financials:** No revenue generation yet, with consistent losses reflected in negative EPS and ROE. The company is relying on equity funding.
*   **News:** Subject to significant news and volatility due to business developments and regulatory changes.

The Hybrid Signal suggests buying a limited number of shares, but the analysis suggests caution given the high-risk profile.
