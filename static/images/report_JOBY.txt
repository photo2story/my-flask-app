| 2024-12-31 | $0.00B  | 60.00%        |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profitability:**  Consistent with the earnings data, revenue is zero. The profit margin is positive, but given zero revenue, this is likely related to non-operating income (e.g., interest income, gains on asset sales) or accounting adjustments, not core business profitability.
*   **Capital & Profitability:** Equity is generally around $0.9B, fluctuating slightly. The negative ROE (Return on Equity) confirms that the company is not currently profitable.

### 7. Overall Summary

JOBY is a high-growth, high-risk company in the eVTOL sector. Recent performance has been strong, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Positive news flow regarding partnerships and market expansion is a likely catalyst for recent price increases. However, the company is pre-revenue and consistently losing money. Analyst opinions are neutral, with a wide range of price targets, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the company's future prospects.  The long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500. The high MRI suggests the stock is attractive based on risk-adjusted factors, while the recent large price increase requires attention and may call for reassessment. Long-term investors should closely monitor the company's progress towards revenue generation and profitability.
