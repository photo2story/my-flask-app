| ---------- | ------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| 2020-2022  | -58.0%  | 71.6% | -53.0% | -0.0 | 2.8    |

*   **CAGR:**  Fluctuating CAGR, with negative returns in earlier periods and strong positive returns in the more recent periods (2022-2025).

*   **Alpha:**  Alpha has varied, with periods of significant underperformance relative to the benchmark in the earlier periods (negative alpha) and outperformance in the later periods (positive alpha).
*   **Beta:** Beta is close to zero, suggesting the stock's returns are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). This can be due to the unique factors driving Joby's performance, such as technological advancements, regulatory approvals, and investor sentiment towards the eVTOL industry, which may not align with broader market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has increased over time, reflecting growth in the company's valuation.

**Analysis:**  The historical data reveals a highly volatile stock with fluctuating performance. The negative Beta and high volatility suggest this stock is heavily influenced by company-specific news and sentiment related to the eVTOL industry, rather than broad market trends. Investors should be prepared for significant price swings.

*   **Capital & Profitability:** The negative Return on Equity (ROE) reflects the company's losses, even with substantial equity. Equity has fluctuated, suggesting capital raises or other financing activities.

**7. Overall Assessment:**

Joby Aviation is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The company is in a pre-revenue stage, and its stock price is driven by speculation about the future potential of the eVTOL market. Recent price surges and volatility suggest that investor sentiment is highly sensitive to news and developments.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **High Risk:** Negative expected return, volatile price action, and negative EPS make this a risky investment.
*   **Speculative:** The investment thesis relies heavily on the successful commercialization of eVTOL technology and market adoption.
*   **Momentum:** Recent price surges and positive short-term indicators suggest that the stock has upward momentum, but it is also overbought and may be due for a correction.
*   **Financials:** The company has substantial equity but is not yet generating revenue and is experiencing losses.
*   **News-Driven:** Stock price is highly sensitive to news events and analyst opinions.

**Recommendation:**

A potential investment in JOBY is highly speculative and suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance. It is crucial to closely monitor the company's progress, regulatory developments, and news flow. Given the current overbought conditions and negative long-term expected return, caution is advised.
