| ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| 2025-09-30 | $0.90B  | -44.76% |

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Overall:** Joby Aviation is a high-growth, high-risk company in the eVTOL industry. It has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the recent past, but this comes with substantial volatility, as evidenced by the high Maximum Drawdown.
*   **Positives:** Strong recent price momentum, positive Alpha in recent periods, significant equity, high profit margins (on limited revenue), and plans for production expansion.
*   **Negatives:** Current unprofitability (negative EPS and ROE), high volatility (MDD), regulatory uncertainty, mixed analyst opinions, and a negative expected return. The negative PPO and recent decline in relative divergence also suggest potential short-term headwinds.
*   **Investment Recommendation:** The investment recommendation is mixed.
    *   The *Hybrid Signal* gives a "Very Safe" buy signal, indicating that an AI-driven approach sees long-term potential.
    *   However, the negative *Expected Return* and the uncertainty reflected in analyst target prices should give investors pause.
    *   The *MRI* suggests medium risk.
*   **Conclusion:** Joby Aviation appears to be a speculative investment suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance who believe in the long-term potential of the eVTOL market. Careful monitoring of news, regulatory developments, and financial performance is essential.
