**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. The price being above the 60-day moving average suggests a possible longer-term upward trend, but the recent dip needs monitoring.

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI indicates relatively low market risk.
*   The RSI is neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   The PPO is negative, indicating a bearish trend.
*   The negative change in relative divergence reinforces the short-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, indicating very pessimistic long-term outlook compared to the S&P 500.
*   The recent price change of -0.15 is not significant enough to drastically alter the analysis, but confirms a slight downward trend.

**7. 종합 Analysis**

**Summary:** Joby Aviation (JOBY) exhibits high risk and significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

*   **Key Concerns:** Consistently negative earnings and ROE, reliance on external funding, high volatility, substantial underperformance relative to market benchmarks, and a negative long-term expected return.

*   **Potential Positives:** Low Market Risk Indicator, neutral RSI, increasing positive profit margins, recent price above 60-day moving average, and potential for future growth in the eVTOL market (though this is highly speculative at this stage).

*   **Recommendation:** Due to the significant risks and current underperformance, a cautious approach is advised. Further research into the recent news events, regulatory progress, and funding situation is critical before considering any investment. The extremely negative expected return warrants significant caution. This stock is suitable only for investors with a very high risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon.
