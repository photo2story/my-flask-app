However, it has a history of high volatility (high MDD) and is currently trading in overbought territory (high RSI). The company is still in a pre-revenue phase with negative profitability (negative EPS and ROE). While recent news and analyst commentary suggest the company is undergoing significant developments, the long-term expected return is negative.
