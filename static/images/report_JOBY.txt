**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate demonstrates significant volatility. The CAGR swings from deeply negative (-46%) to highly positive (96% and 199%) across different periods, which is typical for growth companies in nascent industries.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high (around 81.5-82%), indicating a substantial risk of investment. This is consistent with the volatile nature of the company and the industry it operates in.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha values are also highly variable, reflecting the company's performance relative to the market. High positive Alpha values in the more recent periods (66% and 131%) indicate a significant outperformance compared to the benchmark index, which might be attributed to company-specific events or industry tailwinds.

*   **60-day SMA:** 15.17

*   **Expected Return (%):** -41.93%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the high risk, the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation.  This could be based on long-term growth potential despite short-term risks.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 35.14 indicates that the stock is nearing oversold territory. This could potentially signal a future price increase, but should be confirmed with other indicators.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO (-0.75) also points to a short-term downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a buy strategy with 90% of cash, which aligns with the MRI's high investment recommendation, yet does it in a cautious manner.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decrease in relative divergence confirms the short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return (-41.93%) suggests that, despite potential for significant short-term losses.

    *   **Negative:** Articles highlight a "Sell" rating from Goldman Sachs.
    *   **Neutral/Comparative:** Articles compare Joby to competitors (Archer Aviation).

**Analysis:** The news highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of investing in Joby. Analyst opinions are clearly divided, and investors need to weigh the potential for massive growth against the risk of significant losses. The presence of both positive and negative articles suggests a highly speculative investment environment.

*   **Consensus:** Mixed.
*   **Target Price:** Average: $12.14, High: $22.00, Low: $6.00

**6. Financial Information**

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.02B | 55.44%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.00B | 33.33%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.00B | 60.00%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.00B | 46.43%        |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE      |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.90B | -44.76%  |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.90B | -36.14%  |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.86B | -9.59%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.91B | -26.99%  |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.78B | -18.42%  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** While revenue is still very small, the profit margins are quite high.  This suggests the company can generate significant profits once revenue scales. However, the limited revenue makes these margins less meaningful at this stage.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable around $0.9B, indicating that the company is effectively managing its capital despite negative ROE figures. The negative ROE, as with negative EPS, is expected for a growth company investing heavily in research and development.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Joby Aviation (JOBY) presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.

*   **Potential:** The company is operating in a potentially disruptive market (eVTOL aircraft), and news articles suggest substantial upside potential. JOBY is outperforming the S&P 500 historically.
*   **Risks:** The company is currently unprofitable with a negative expected return, has a high Beta, faces significant competition, and has mixed analyst ratings.  The current downtrend in price, confirmed by technical indicators (SMA, RSI, PPO), adds to the risk.
