Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided information about Joby Aviation (JOBY), followed by a comprehensive analysis:

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** JOBY
*   **Company Overview:** Joby Aviation Inc. is developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commercial passenger service.
*   **JOBY Cumulative Return:** 69.92%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 55.13%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 22.3
    *   Relative Divergence: 62.4

The current divergence of 22.3 indicates a positive difference in cumulative return, while the relative divergence of 62.4 suggests the current divergence is in the upper-middle range compared to its historical fluctuations with the S&P 500. This positive divergence should be considered with the Alpha, Beta and MDD analysis below:

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -60.0%  | 78.9% | -41.0%  | -0.0 | 3.0    |

| 2023-2025  | 116.0%  | 78.3% | 50.0%   | 0.1  | 12.1   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The CAGR shows large swings, demonstrating JOBY's high-growth, high-risk profile.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha indicates the stock's performance relative to the benchmark index. The high and positive alpha in the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods suggests JOBY outperformed its benchmark after accounting for risk. But the negative alpha during 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 indicates the opposite.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is low, close to zero, suggesting a very low correlation with the overall market.  This means JOBY's price movements are largely independent of the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization increases over the periods reflecting company's growth.

*   **5-day SMA:** 13.834
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.4696
*   **60-day SMA:** 15.3106

**Analysis:**  The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downward trend. The recent price decrease (change of -2.36%) reinforces this.

*   **RSI:** 32.92 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.6176

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.5 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -19.4

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** While the Market Risk Indicator suggests a "High Investment Recommended" rating based on its criteria, this should be viewed with caution given other indicators.
*   **RSI:**  An RSI of 32.92 suggests the stock is nearing oversold conditions, potentially indicating a possible bounce back in price, though this isn't guaranteed.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO indicates a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The algorithm recommends a 100% investment of available cash, but this recommendation should be considered alongside other indicators and your own risk tolerance. The "Very Safe" label seems optimistic given the company's volatility.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms a short-term downtrend relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The negative expected return (-19.4%) suggests caution and indicates that analysts/algorithms predict underperformance compared to current levels.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed, with optimistic pieces countered by analyst downgrades and concerns about the current stock price. The Uber partnership is a clear positive, but analyst skepticism is a red flag.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue  |
|------------|-------|----------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.48 | 0.02 B$  |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.41 | 0.00 B$  |
| 2025-05-08 | -0.11 | 0.00 B$  |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.00 B$  |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.00 B$  |

**Analysis:** Joby is currently unprofitable, with consistently negative EPS.  While revenue is slowly increasing, it remains very low. The duplicate entry for 2025-11-06 should be investigated to ensure data accuracy. This pattern indicates that the company is still in its growth phase with a long way to profitability.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.02B    | 55.44%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.00B    | 33.33%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.00B    | 60.00%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.00B    | 46.43%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.90B    | -44.76%   |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.90B    | -36.14%   |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.86B    | -9.59%    |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.78B    | -18.42%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profitability:** While revenue is slowly starting to appear, the profit margins on that revenue are high, indicating good cost control *on the sales they are making*. This is misleading due to the small revenue numbers.
*   **Capital & Profitability:**  Equity is relatively stable around $0.9 billion. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative and significant, confirming the company's unprofitability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Joby Aviation presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.

*   **Positives:**
    *   Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 (but with high volatility).
    *   Positive news regarding the Uber partnership indicates potential market expansion.
    *   High profit margins *on the revenue they have*.
*   **Negatives:**
    *   Consistently negative earnings and ROE.
    *   Analyst downgrades and a target price below the current market price.
    *   High Maximum Drawdown indicates substantial risk of loss.
    *   A low Beta indicates that the stock is not strongly correlated with the performance of the broader market, meaning market gains may not translate into gains for JOBY.
    *   Despite the MRI stating "High Investment Recommended" the consensus is that more caution is needed.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data, JOBY appears to be a speculative investment. While the potential for significant gains exists (as suggested by the Motley Fool articles), the company's current unprofitability, analyst skepticism, and high volatility warrant extreme caution. The news cycle is mixed, and the technical indicators are not overwhelmingly positive. Potential investors should carefully weigh the risks and rewards and conduct thorough due diligence before investing. The "Hybrid Signal" buy recommendation should not be followed blindly.
