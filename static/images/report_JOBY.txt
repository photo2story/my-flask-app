**7. 종합분석(Overall Analysis)**

Joby Aviation (JOBY) presents a mixed and high-risk profile.

*   **Negative Factors:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, high volatility, negative EPS, negative ROE, zero revenue (despite positive profit margins), and a deeply negative expected return.
*   **Positive Factors:** Low Market Risk Indicator (MRI), recent positive price momentum, and potential for significant future growth in the eVTOL industry (though this is highly speculative at this point). The company maintains a solid equity base despite ongoing losses.
*   **Concerns:** The lack of revenue is a major red flag. The combination of zero revenue and a high profit margin indicates that those profit margins are calculated on an extremely small base or through non-operating income. The hybrid signal suggesting caution and the high cash allocation indicates uncertainty about the company's near-term prospects.
*   **Recommendation:** Due to the high risk and speculative nature of this stock, investors should exercise extreme caution. It might be suitable for a small, high-risk portion of a portfolio, but only with a clear understanding of the potential for significant losses. Given the significant underperformance and negative expected return, the stock is not recommended for long-term accumulation. Investors should closely monitor news and company announcements to stay informed about the company's progress and any potential changes in its prospects.
