Joby Aviation (JOBY) is a high-growth, high-risk company in the eVTOL space. It is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, with negative earnings and revenue. However, there are signs of recent positive momentum in the stock price and improving profit margins. The company is heavily reliant on future developments and regulatory approvals for its long-term success. Recent news indicates significant activity and volatility, which may present opportunities but also increases risk.

**Recommendation:**

Given the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the negative expected return, and the lack of current revenue, a cautious approach is warranted.

*   **Risk-Averse Investors:** Should avoid investing in JOBY until there is a clear path to profitability and revenue generation.
*   **Risk-Tolerant Investors:** May consider a small speculative position, but only after thorough due diligence and with the understanding that the investment carries substantial risk. Continuously monitor news and company announcements for updates on regulatory approvals, technological advancements, and financial performance.
