*   **Return Comparison:**
    *   JOBY Cumulative Return: 82.77%

    *   Relative Divergence: 66.8

*   **Analysis:** JOBY has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. The current divergence of 29.0 indicates that JOBY's cumulative return exceeds the S&P 500 by 29 percentage points. The relative divergence of 66.8 suggests that the current divergence is positioned at the 66.8th percentile of its historical divergence range, indicating that while positive, the divergence isn't at its historical peak.

*   **Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Analysis:**
    *   The Alpha values are predominantly negative in the early periods (2020-2023), indicating underperformance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500) after adjusting for risk (Beta). However, Alpha turns positive in more recent periods (2022-2025), indicating outperformance.
    *   Beta is near zero, suggesting JOBY's price movement has had very low correlation with the S&P 500. This is typical for early-stage companies in disruptive industries.
    *   CAGR shows substantial volatility. Negative CAGR in earlier periods is followed by very high growth in later periods, reflecting the speculative nature of the stock.
    *   MDD remains consistently high, signaling significant drawdown risk.
