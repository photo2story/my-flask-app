2025-12-07 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down the analysis of Joby Aviation Inc. (JOBY).

**Company Overview:** Joby Aviation Inc. is developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commercial passenger service.

**1) Return Analysis & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **JOBY Cumulative Return:** 88.04%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 54.20%
*   **Divergence:** 29.1
*   **Relative Divergence:** 66.9%

**Analysis:** JOBY has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period.  The divergence of 29.1 indicates a substantial difference in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 66.9% suggests that the current divergence is in the upper-middle range of its historical divergence patterns.  This means while JOBY has outperformed, its current outperformance isn't at the extreme high end of what it *could* be, based on past data.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -60.0%  | 78.9%  | -41.0%  | -0.0  | 3.2    |
| 2021-2023  | -21.0%  | 78.9%  | -22.0%  | 0.0   | 6.3    |
| 2022-2024  | 66.0%   | 78.9%  | 45.0%   | 0.0   | 7.7    |
| 2023-2025  | 134.0%  | 78.3%  | 69.0%   | 0.1   | 13.9   |

*   **CAGR:**  Shows a dramatic improvement in recent periods.  Initially deeply negative, it has turned strongly positive.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High drawdowns consistently indicate significant volatility and risk.  The MDD is consistently high at nearly 80%
*   **Alpha:**  The negative alpha in early periods indicates underperformance relative to a risk-free rate.  The recent positive and large alpha values suggest significant outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values hovering around 0 suggests the return of the stock is relatively uncorrelated with the S&P500
*   **Cap(B):** Increasing capitalization suggests growing investor interest and company size.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 14.63
*   **Last Market Data:** Price = 15.26, Previous Close = 15.76, Change = -3.17%
*   **5-day SMA:** 14.28
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.43
*   **60-day SMA:** 15.61

**Analysis:**  The stock price closed lower than its last market data (-3.17%), and the short-term moving averages (5-day and 20-day) are below the longer-term 60-day SMA. This *suggests a recent downward trend*. The slightly lower close price than the current price indicates a potential rebound in progress.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 35.14 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.58
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" (Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.9 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -17.0%

**Analysis:**
*   The Medium Investment MRI suggests a moderate level of risk.
*   The RSI is approaching oversold conditions, which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity if investors believe the stock is undervalued.
*   The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent short-term decline.
*   The significant price drop is suggestive of fluctuation issue and/or volatility
*   The *negative* expected return of -17.0% is a major red flag, indicating that the model predicts underperformance compared to other investment options.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Recent headlines from Investor's Business Daily, Barron's, and Business Insider highlight Goldman Sachs' "Sell" rating and concerns about the company being overhyped. This *negative analyst sentiment* is a significant concern.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Conversely, The Motley Fool published an optimistic prediction about Joby's long-term prospects. TipRanks reported on billionaire Israel Englander's investment, which presents a mixed signal.
*   **Valuation Concerns:** The simplywall.st article discusses reassessing the valuation after a strong rally, suggesting that the stock may be overvalued.

**Analysis:** Recent news paints a mixed but leaning negative picture.  Negative analyst ratings and concerns about overvaluation are dominant themes. While there are some positive articles, the overall tone suggests caution.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (3.40 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 12.14 / 22.00 / 6.00

**Analysis:** The "Hold" consensus and the average target price of $12.14 is *below* the current price of 14.63, suggesting potential *downside*. The wide range in target prices indicates considerable uncertainty among analysts. The lack of Recent Rating Changes data makes it difficult to assess shifting sentiment.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출     |
|------------|--------|----------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.48  | 0.02 B$  |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.41  | 0.00 B$  |
| 2025-05-08 | -0.11  | 0.00 B$  |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.21  | 0.00 B$  |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21  | 0.00 B$  |

**Analysis:** The company is consistently losing money, as indicated by the negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) figures. Revenue generation is minimal. The recent jump in revenue needs to be sustained and grown to justify investment.

**6) Financial Information:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.02B  | 55.44%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.00B  | 33.33%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.00B  | 60.00%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.00B  | 46.43%        |

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE     |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.90B  | -44.76% |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.90B  | -36.14% |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.86B  | -9.59%  |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.91B  | -26.99% |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.78B  | -18.42% |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue remains low, although there is a slight increase in the most recent quarter. While profit margins appear high, they are based on extremely small revenue numbers, making them less meaningful.
*   **Capital & Profitability:** Equity is fluctuating, indicating the company may be issuing stock or taking on debt. The ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating profits from its equity. The significant negative ROE highlights its inability to generate profit relative to its shareholder equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Overall, the analysis of Joby Aviation (JOBY) presents a mixed and risky picture:

*   **High Growth Potential, High Risk:** JOBY operates in a potentially disruptive industry (eVTOL aircraft). It has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, this potential comes with substantial risk.
*   **Negative Analyst Sentiment & Valuation Concerns:** Recent negative analyst ratings and concerns about overvaluation are worrying. The consensus price target is below the current market price.
*   **Unprofitable & Cash Burning:** The company is currently unprofitable, with negative earnings and ROE. It is burning through cash. Revenue is minimal, though there was a slight increase in the most recent quarter.
*   **Recent Downward Trend:** Recent price action and indicator analysis suggest a short-term downward trend.
*   **High Volatility:** High MDD numbers, and negative divergence change over the past 20 days indicates a volatility

**Conclusion:**

Investing in JOBY is highly speculative. The company's long-term success depends on factors such as technological advancements, regulatory approvals, manufacturing capabilities, and market adoption. The current valuation seems stretched, given the company's financial performance and the challenges it faces. The analyst consensus, negative expected returns, and recent negative press suggest exercising extreme caution. The recent decline in stock price coupled with improving SMA values may be a sign of improvement, or more turbulence to come.
