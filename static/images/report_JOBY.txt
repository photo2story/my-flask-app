**2) Alpha/Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|------|-------|------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -60.0% | 78.9% | -41.0% | -0.0 | 3.0    |

| 2023-2025  | 124.0% | 78.3% | 61.0%  | 0.1  | 12.6   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows a stark improvement over time. The negative returns in the earlier periods (2020-2022, 2021-2023) turned dramatically positive in the later periods (2022-2024, 2023-2025), indicating strong recent growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is a measure of how much an investment outperforms or underperforms a benchmark index. A positive Alpha indicates outperformance. The Alpha figures are negative in the early periods but become strongly positive in the more recent periods.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the volatility of a stock compared to the overall market (S&P 500). A Beta of 0.0 suggests the stock has little to no correlation with the market, and 0.1 indicates slightly correlated to the market, which can be considered defensive investing.
*   **Cap:** Joby's cap increased 4-fold over the past 5 years.

*   **Previous Close:** 13.20
*   **Change:** 4.92%
*   **5-day SMA:** 14.03
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.39
*   **60-day SMA:** 15.61

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price increased 4.92% compared to the previous close.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term downtrend but the recent price increase may indicate a reversal.
*   The most recent price is below all moving averages, this usually indicates a downtrend but the upward price movement needs to be considered.

**4) Index Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.46
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.58
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (6654 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -10.9 (Indicates a short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -17.3% (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 45.46 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-0.58) suggests that short-term price momentum is weaker than long-term price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests buying and being fully invested (0% cash) is considered very safe, with a high MRI of 0.90. This contradicts with "Expected Return (%) = -17.3" which needs to be considered.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence suggests short-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The negative expected return (-17.3%) suggests that the model predicts underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term from the current price.

**8) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.02B     | 55.44%        |

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE         |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.90B     | -44.76%     |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.90B     | -36.14%     |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.78B     | -18.42%     |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue is minimal, but profit margins, when revenue exists, are surprisingly high. This is likely related to specific non-recurring items or partnerships at this stage.
*   **Capital & Profitability:** Equity has fluctuated but remains high (around $0.9B). Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, reflecting the company's unprofitability. The increasing negative ROE in recent quarters indicates that the company's losses are accelerating.

**9) Comprehensive Summary**

**Overall Assessment:**

Joby Aviation is a high-growth, high-risk investment. It has outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, indicating strong market enthusiasm, but this comes with substantial volatility.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Strong recent growth and outperformance.
    *   Expansion plans (doubling production).
    *   Innovation in a potentially disruptive sector (eVTOL).
    *   Significant equity base.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Consistently negative earnings and ROE.
    *   High maximum drawdown (MDD).
    *   Analyst uncertainty and a target price below the current market price.
*   **Risks:**
    *   Regulatory hurdles.
    *   Competition from established players (Boeing) and other eVTOL companies (Archer).
    *   Reliance on future revenue generation.
*   **Recommendation:**

The MRI indicates a medium investment recommendation (0.7). However, the negative expected returns based on the model (-17.3%) raises serious concerns. The recommendation from "Hybrid Signal" is "cash_0%_Buy 100%" and conflicts with the expected returns; use at your own risk. Given the negative earnings, high volatility, and regulatory risks, **a cautious approach is warranted.** The investor should use the information as they see fit and make sure to research properly.
