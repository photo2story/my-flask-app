The inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-11-06) within the provided data requires verification and clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial statements reveal significant concerns:

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Zero revenue across the reported quarters is a major red flag. Although profit margins are positive, they are meaningless without revenue.
* **Capital and Profitability:** While equity is substantial, the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company isn't generating returns on its invested capital.  The sharp decline in equity across recent quarters further signals financial instability.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Joby Aviation's performance is deeply concerning.  The lack of revenue, consistently negative EPS, declining equity, and negative ROE paint a grim financial picture.  While the stock price shows some short-term stability, the long-term outlook appears extremely bearish. The significant underperformance against the S&P 500 and the projected negative long-term return strongly suggest caution.  Further investigation into the causes of the negative earnings and lack of revenue generation is crucial before any investment consideration.  The data suggests high risk and low potential for future returns.
