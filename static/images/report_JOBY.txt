|------------|----------|---------|---------|-------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | 131.0%   | 73.0%   | 69.0%   | 0.1 | 13.3   |

**Analysis:**

*   JOBY has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  However, the high relative divergence suggests this outperformance may be stretched.
*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate varies significantly across the years, with the most recent period (2023-2025) showing substantial growth (131.0%). However, earlier periods indicate negative growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, around 70-80%, indicating substantial risk and volatility in JOBY's returns.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values fluctuate and are significant, indicating the stock's returns are not highly correlated with the market, but the most recent period shows a positive Alpha (69.0%), suggesting outperformance.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are very low, close to 0. This implies that JOBY's price movements are not strongly correlated with the S&P 500, and it is relatively independent of broader market trends.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has increased over the periods, indicating growth in the company's overall value.

*   **Expected Return (%):** -9.6% (Projected underperformance vs. S&P 500 over a 2+ year investment horizon)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a generally favorable investment environment, but the negative change in relative divergence and negative expected return suggest caution. The recent price decrease confirms short-term downside pressure.

*   **Equity Fluctuations:** The equity of the company has been fluctuating.
*   **Negative ROE:** The Return on Equity (ROE) is negative across all quarters, which aligns with the company's overall unprofitability. The negative ROE indicates that the company is not generating profit from its equity investments.

### 7. Overall Summary

Joby Aviation is a high-growth, high-risk company with significant potential but also considerable uncertainty.

*   **Positive Catalysts:** Strong recent outperformance, positive news flow around air taxi developments, and a "Buy" hybrid signal.
*   **Warning Signs:** High volatility (MDD), negative expected return, negative earnings, analyst consensus is "Hold," and the stock's price has recently decreased.
*   **Key Consideration:** JOBY is a speculative investment. Its success depends on the successful commercialization of its eVTOL technology and the establishment of a viable air taxi market. The company is currently burning through cash and is not yet generating revenue.

**Recommendation:** Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted. If considering an investment, it should be a small allocation within a well-diversified portfolio and should be viewed as a long-term, high-risk opportunity.
