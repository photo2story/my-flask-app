|------------|----------|-------|---------|------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | 162.0%   | 73.0% | 99.0%   | 0.1  | 15.6   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows a dramatic turnaround from negative growth in earlier periods to significant growth in the most recent period (2023-2025).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha values show underperformance in earlier periods, but substantial outperformance in the most recent period.
*   **Beta:** Beta is consistently near zero, indicating JOBY's price movements have very low correlation with the overall market (S&P 500). This suggests that JOBY's price is more influenced by company-specific factors than broad market trends.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has increased significantly over time, reflecting growing investor interest and confidence in the company.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 16.7787
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 15.2799
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 15.7768

**Analysis:** The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting positive short-term and medium-term momentum. The significant price increase from the previous close (change of 2.58) indicates a notable positive event or sentiment shift.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **RSI:** 75.67 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 2.12

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 8.5 (+) Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return:** -7.0% (Over 2 years relative to S&P 500).

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, but the overbought RSI (above 70) indicates that the stock may be due for a pullback.
*   The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being positive suggests upward momentum.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" advocates for full investment, reflecting confidence in the stock's potential, but it's important to consider the MRI in conjunction with other indicators.
*   The increase in relative divergence confirms short-term upward price movement.
*   The negative expected return (-7%) is a concern, suggesting potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a longer investment horizon.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Positive Catalysts:** Recent news highlights partnerships for air taxi services (UAE, Japan), industry recognition (Motley Fool "10-Baggers"), and positive market reports on the commercial electric aircraft market.
*   **Valuation Focus:**  Articles discuss evaluating Joby's valuation, suggesting this is an area of investor concern and scrutiny.

**Analysis:** The news flow is generally positive, highlighting expansion plans and market recognition.  However, the focus on valuation suggests that investors are carefully considering whether the current price is justified.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 3.22)
*   **Target Price:** Average: $10.83, High: $22.00, Low: $6.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," and the average target price is significantly below the current price, implying potential downside. The wide range between the high and low target prices reflects uncertainty and differing opinions among analysts.  Absence of recent rating changes makes it harder to assess the sentiment.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue |
|------------|-------|---------|

| 2024-06-30 | $0.89B  | -13.78%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:**  Consistent with the earnings data, revenue is zero.
*   **Profit Margin:** Positive profit margins when revenue is zero might seem contradictory, but this can be caused by other income such as from investments or other company activities.
*   **Equity:** Equity has fluctuated over the past few quarters, indicating changes in the company's net asset value.
*   **ROE:** The negative Return on Equity (ROE) reflects the company's losses.

**7. Overall Assessment**

Joby Aviation is a high-growth, high-risk company with significant potential but also substantial challenges.

*   **Strengths:** Positive recent stock performance, favorable news flow regarding partnerships and market recognition, a high MRI suggesting investment recommendation based on the model, and a strong balance sheet.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of current revenue generation, negative earnings and ROE, an overbought RSI suggesting a possible pullback, analyst consensus leaning toward "Hold" with a lower average target price, and a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Key Considerations:** The company's success hinges on the successful development and commercialization of its eVTOL technology, regulatory approvals, and its ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability. Investors should carefully weigh the potential rewards against the inherent risks before investing in JOBY. The high beta and high MDD emphasizes the speculative aspect of this investment. The discrepancy between the recent stock appreciation and the negative expected return highlights the dependence on future execution and market sentiment.

In summary, JOBY presents a speculative investment opportunity with significant upside potential but also considerable downside risk. Conduct thorough due diligence and assess your risk tolerance before investing.
