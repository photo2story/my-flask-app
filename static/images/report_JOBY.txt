**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows a recovery, moving from significant negative growth to substantial positive growth in recent periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values suggest significant volatility and potential risk.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values fluctuates, with negative Alphas initially indicating underperformance compared to the market, but turning positive in later periods, implying some outperformance.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values are negative, suggesting JOBY's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market.
*   **Cap (B):** The market capitalization has increased over time.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 13.46
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 13.43, Previous Close: 13.46, Change: -0.22 (Slight downward pressure)
*   **Moving Averages:** 5-day: 13.382, 20-day: 15.158, 60-day: 13.9155

**Analysis:** The stock is currently trading below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The slight decline in the last market data confirms this recent weakness.

**3. Technical Indicators & Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 22.99 (Oversold)

*   **Hybrid Signal:** Suggests a cash position of 70% and selling 0.4% of holdings (6 shares).
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.5 (Indicates a recent short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -30.0% (Long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity, though the negative PPO suggests caution. The MRI suggests low market risk. However, the negative expected return indicates that, based on the data, long-term investments may underperform the S&P 500.

The small *change* of -0.22 isn't significant enough to flag major volatility alone, but in context with other indicators, reinforces the downward trend.

**7. Overall Assessment:**

Joby Aviation is a high-growth, high-risk investment. The company is still in the pre-revenue stage, with negative earnings and ROE.

**In summary:** While the long-term potential of the eVTOL market may be attractive, significant risks and uncertainties remain regarding Joby Aviation's ability to achieve profitability and deliver on its promises. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in JOBY. The recent oversold RSI could present a speculative buying opportunity, but the overall picture suggests caution.
