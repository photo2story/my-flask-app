### 7. Overall Assessment

JOBY presents a mixed picture.

**Positives:**

*   Recent positive price momentum, reflected in moving averages.
*   High Alpha in recent periods (2022-2024 and 2023-2025), indicating outperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   The MRI suggests a low-risk environment.
*   High relative spread.

**Negatives/Risks:**

*   The extremely high RSI indicates the stock is overbought and potentially due for a correction.
*   The negative expected return suggests potential long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   Recent news points to potential volatility and significant events.
*   Consistently negative earnings and ROE, reflecting the company's development-stage status.
*   High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) in all periods, reflecting significant volatility and risk.

**Recommendation:**

The data suggests a cautious approach. While short-term momentum may be positive, the overbought RSI and negative long-term expected return warrant caution. Investors should closely monitor news and company announcements, particularly regarding regulatory approvals and commercialization progress. Given the negative earnings and the inherent risks of investing in a development-stage company, a diversified portfolio and a risk-tolerant investment horizon are essential.
