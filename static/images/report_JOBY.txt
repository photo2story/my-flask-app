| 2025-06-30 | $0.00B  | 33.33%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.00B  | 60.00%        |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:**  Revenue remains at $0.00B for all reported quarters, consistent with a pre-revenue company.  The positive profit margins are likely due to non-cash accounting items or other factors unrelated to actual sales.
*   **Equity:** Equity fluctuates, indicating changes in the company's capital structure. The recent stock offering likely contributed to this.
*   **ROE:**  Negative ROE reflects the company's unprofitability. The significantly negative ROE in the most recent quarter is concerning.

### 7. Overall Assessment

Joby Aviation is a high-growth, high-risk company in the eVTOL space.

*   **Strengths:**  Significant outperformance vs. the S&P 500 (although volatile), recent stock offering boosting capital, progress in aircraft certification.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Pre-revenue, consistently negative earnings and ROE, high MDD, analyst consensus is "Hold" with a target price below the current price, stock dilution from offerings.

**Recommendation:**

Given the high-risk nature of Joby Aviation, its pre-revenue status, and negative profitability metrics, a cautious approach is warranted. The recent stock offering and analyst target prices below the current trading price suggest potential downside risks. The MRI value of 0.9 suggests the general market is conducive to investment. However, a significant investment should only be considered by investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon.  Careful monitoring of the company's progress towards commercialization, regulatory approvals, and financial performance is crucial. A smaller, speculative position might be considered if an investor is highly bullish on the eVTOL sector. The hybrid signal recommendation can be considered for long-term investment.
