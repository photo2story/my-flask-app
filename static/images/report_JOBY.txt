    | 2023-2025  | 110.0% | 44.6% | 48.0%   | 2.0  | 12.0   |

    *   **CAGR:**  Shows a trend of increasing annual growth, but with volatility (as seen in the significant range).
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates the potential for substantial losses. The MDD values suggest Joby is a relatively risky investment.
    *   **Alpha:** The positive and increasing Alpha values suggest that Joby has been outperforming its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.
    *   **Beta:** A Beta consistently above 1 indicates that Joby is more volatile than the S&P 500. The increasing Beta suggests Joby's volatility relative to the market is also increasing.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 14.36
*   **Previous Close:** 13.2
*   **Change:** 8.79%
*   **5-day SMA:** 13.64
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.42
*   **60-day SMA:** 15.10

*   **Analysis:** The current price is above the 5-day SMA but below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs.  The large positive change from the previous close suggests a recent upward price swing. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, which can be seen as short term upward trend, but long term downward trend.

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 41.04 (Approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity)
*   **PPO:** -0.24 (Below zero, suggesting a slight downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -7.4 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -23.7% (Negative expected return suggests potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI indicates that the stock is not yet oversold but is approaching that level. The PPO shows a slight downtrend. The hybrid signal suggests a high buy recommendation. However, it contradicts with the "Expected Return," which is negative. It means you may expect to loose -23.7% compared to S&P 500.
