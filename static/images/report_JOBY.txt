**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** JOBY (Joby Aviation Inc)
*   **Company Overview:** Joby Aviation is a company developing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for commercial passenger service.
*   **JOBY Cumulative Return:** 81.42%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 53.50%

    *   Min: -72.2
    *   Current: 29.1
    *   Relative Divergence: 66.9

**Analysis:**  JOBY has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in cumulative return. However, the "Divergence" data suggests this outperformance has been volatile. The relative divergence of 66.9 indicates that the current divergence is positioned in the upper half of its historical range, suggesting that JOBY is closer to its maximum relative outperformance compared to VOO.

**2) Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -60.0%  | 78.9% | -41.0% | -0.0 | 3.1    |
| 2021-2023  | -21.0%  | 78.9% | -22.0% | 0.0  | 6.1    |

| 2023-2025  | 128.0%  | 78.3% | 63.0%  | 0.1  | 12.9   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth rate over the period. This has improved significantly in recent periods, turning positive in the last two periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. High drawdowns (around 78-79%) indicate significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the investment's performance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). Positive alpha means outperformance, negative means underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Measures the investment's volatility relative to the market. A beta of 0.0 indicates very low correlation with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Represents the market capitalization in billions.

**Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta analysis shows a highly volatile investment.  While recent CAGR and Alpha are positive and strong, the MDD remains very high, indicating significant risk. The Beta is very low, indicating that Joby Aviation's stock price is very weakly correlated with the market in general. The steady increase in Market Capitalization may reflect growing investor interest.

**3) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 14.115
*   **Last-market:** price: 14.1201, previousClose: 13.83, change: 2.1
*   **5-day SMA:** 14.138
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.4617
*   **60-day SMA:** 15.5921

**Analysis:** The stock price closed slightly higher than its previous close. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term downward trend, as the shorter-term averages are lower than the longer-term averages.

**4) Index Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 28.32 (Oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.2252
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (6654 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.9 (Negative - Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -17.0

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests a high investment opportunity, but should be taken with caution with the other indicators.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 28.32 indicates the stock is currently oversold, which *could* suggest a potential buying opportunity as it may be undervalued.
*   **PPO:** The PPO being slightly positive suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, but the value being close to zero means that it is not a strong signal.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests investing all available cash, aligning with the high MRI. However, this should be balanced with other risk factors.
*   **Divergence Change:**  The recent negative change in relative divergence confirms the short-term downward trend suggested by the moving averages.
*   **Expected Return:** The negative expected return of -17% is a significant red flag, suggesting the model predicts underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.

**5) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Headlines:** Several articles highlight a "Sell" recommendation from Goldman Sachs, citing overvaluation and potential overhype.
*   **Contradictory Views:** Some articles predict significant growth potential in the long term.
*   **Analyst Comparison:** Articles compare Joby to competitors like Archer Aviation, discussing which has more upside.

**Analysis:** The news sentiment is mixed but trending negatively due to the Goldman Sachs downgrade. The presence of articles comparing Joby to competitors is important, highlighting the competitive landscape. The long-term bullish articles provide a counterpoint, but the near-term concerns seem to be dominating.

**6) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 3.40 (Hold)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 12.14 / 22.00 / 6.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent changes specified.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting a neutral outlook. The average target price ($12.14) is *below* the current price ($14.12), implying potential downside. The wide range between the high and low target prices ($22.00 and $6.00) highlights significant disagreement among analysts regarding the stock's future potential.

**7) Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출     |
|------------|-------|----------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.48 | 0.02 B$  |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.41 | 0.00 B$  |
| 2025-05-08 | -0.11 | 0.00 B$  |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.00 B$  |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.00 B$  |

**Analysis:** The table shows consistent losses per share (EPS) and limited revenue. While revenue increased in the most recent quarter, the high negative EPS indicates that the company is not yet profitable. The EPS of 2025-11-06 is showing twice. You should check the source data.

**8) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.02B     | 55.44%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.00B     | 33.33%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.00B     | 60.00%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.00B     | 46.43%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE          |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.90B     | -44.76%      |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.90B     | -36.14%      |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.78B     | -18.42%      |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains low but is increasing. Profit margins are high but on a small revenue base, so the actual profit is minimal.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has fluctuated. The negative Return on Equity (ROE) values reflect the company's unprofitability, meaning it's not generating profits from shareholder equity.

**9) Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

Joby Aviation is a high-risk, high-potential stock. It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 recently, but this outperformance has been volatile. The company is operating in a nascent and competitive industry (eVTOL aircraft).

**Key Concerns:**

*   **Lack of Profitability:**  The company is currently unprofitable, with consistent losses per share (EPS) and negative Return on Equity (ROE).
*   **Negative Expected Return:** Models predict underperformance versus the S&P 500.
*   **Analyst Downgrades:** Goldman Sachs' "Sell" recommendation has negatively impacted sentiment.
*   **High Volatility:** The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlights the stock's volatility.
*   **Valuation:** The average analyst target price is *below* the current price, suggesting potential overvaluation.

**Potential Positives:**

*   **High MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests a strong buy, but requires more careful considerations.
*   **Strong Alpha:** Recent Alpha values are strong, indicating outperformance potential.
*   **Oversold Condition:** The RSI indicates the stock is currently oversold, potentially offering a buying opportunity.
*   **Long-Term Growth Potential:** Some analysts predict significant long-term growth.
*   **High Profit Margins (on small revenue):**  The potential for high profit margins as revenue scales up is promising.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the data, a cautious approach is warranted. The negative profitability, analyst downgrades, and negative expected return are significant concerns. While the high MRI and potential for long-term growth are appealing, the risks seem to outweigh the rewards at the current price. A potential investor should consider a small, speculative position if they believe in the long-term vision of Joby Aviation and are comfortable with high volatility. Closely monitor future earnings reports and news developments. Do not rely solely on the Hybrid Signal without considering the other negative indicators.
