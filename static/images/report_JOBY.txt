*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Remains consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.  This is typical for growth stocks, especially in emerging industries like eVTOL.
*   **Alpha:**  Positive and increasing alpha values suggest JOBY is generating returns independent of the market. The alpha has grown substantially, indicating increasing outperformance compared to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Consistently low Beta near 0.0 to 0.1 indicates that the stock has very low correlation with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Company capitalization keeps increasing.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **60-day SMA:** 15.58

**Analysis:**

The stock price closed at 14.22 with a positive change of 2.67% relative to the previous close. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This *could* suggest a short-term downward trend or consolidation, as the shorter-term moving averages are lagging behind the longer-term averages.  However, the recent positive price change indicates a potential rebound.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 51.05
*   **PPO:** -0.43

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -10.9 (단기하락 - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -17.3%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** A value of 51.05 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A slightly negative PPO (-0.43) indicates that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, confirming the possibility of a short-term downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Suggests a strong buy signal with monthly investments. The system assesses it as "Very Safe" with a high MRI of 0.9.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The 20-day relative divergence change indicates a recent short-term decline in performance relative to the comparison stock (S&P 500).
*   **Expected Return:** The negative expected return of -17.3% suggests that, based on the model, the stock is likely to underperform the S&P 500 over a longer-term investment horizon (more than 2 years), requiring caution.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Analyst Coverage:** Several articles discuss whether JOBY is a good buy for 2026, comparing it to competitors like Archer Aviation. Some analysts seem optimistic.
*   **Production Expansion:** News about Joby doubling its U.S. production is a positive signal.
*   **Partnership:** The partnership with Metropolis to develop vertiport sites is another positive development, indicating infrastructure growth potential.

**Analysis:**

Recent news is generally positive, highlighting analyst optimism, production expansion, and strategic partnerships. These events could be driving investor interest and contributing to the stock's recent performance. The comparison articles with Archer Aviation suggest that the eVTOL space is becoming more competitive.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Mean (1=StrongBuy~5=Sell):** No Key available.
*   **Opinions:** 7
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 12.14 / 22.00 / 6.00

**Analysis:**

Analyst opinions are mixed. While there are 7 opinions considered, the missing Key value makes the analysis challenging. The average target price is slightly below the current price, while the high target price is significantly higher. This reflects uncertainty about the stock's future potential.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출      |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.48 | 0.02 B$   |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.41 | 0.00 B$   |
| 2025-05-08 | -0.11 | 0.00 B$   |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.00 B$   |
| 2025-11-06 | -0.21 | 0.00 B$   |

**Analysis:**

*   **EPS:**  Earnings per share are negative in all reported quarters. While the numbers are negative, the recent values are improving (from -0.48 to -0.11). The repetition in the last row looks odd and needs verification.
*   **Revenue:** Revenue is minimal in most quarters, except for a notable $0.02B in the most recent quarter (2025-11-06). This single positive value is a good sign.

The company is still in a pre-profitability phase, as is typical for growth companies in emerging industries. The improving EPS and recent increase in revenue indicate potential progress towards profitability, but further improvements are needed.

| 2024-09-30   | $0.78B   | -18.42%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**
    *   Revenue is generally low, but the recent $0.02B in 2025-09-30 is a significant positive development.
    *   Profit margins are high in the quarters where there is revenue, but this is likely due to low operating costs at this stage.
*   **Capital and Profitability:**
    *   Equity is relatively stable around $0.9B.
    *   ROE (Return on Equity) is negative, which is consistent with the negative EPS. The trend is improving as the losses are decreasing.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

**Summary:**

Joby Aviation (JOBY) is a high-growth, high-risk stock in the emerging eVTOL industry. It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 recently. Positive news flow, including analyst optimism, production expansion, and strategic partnerships, appears to be driving investor interest. The company is still in a pre-profitability phase. While the recent revenue is a positive sign, the negative EPS and ROE indicate the company's current loss-making status. The high MDD and the somewhat high MRI should be considered. The hybrid signal shows it as a very safe investment. Analyst opinions are mixed. The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 adds further caution to long-term investment from the current position.

**Investment Recommendation:**

Based on the data provided, a cautious approach is recommended. The high growth potential and positive news justify *some* level of investment, but the high risk and negative profitability metrics require careful consideration. Monitor future earnings reports, news, and analyst ratings closely. Consider the potential for the stock to be overvalued due to hype surrounding the eVTOL industry.
