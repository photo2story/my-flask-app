* **Alpha and Beta Analysis:**
    * The table highlights the volatility and risk-adjusted returns of JOBY.  The Beta values suggest the stock has shown periods of both higher and lower volatility than the market, with an overall trend towards slightly lower volatility.  The Alpha values indicate that JOBY has generally underperformed the market, particularly in 2021 and 2024. 
    * This suggests that JOBY's stock has struggled to deliver returns independent of market movements, potentially due to challenges in the EVTOL sector or company-specific factors.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** JOBY closed at 4.87, slightly lower than the last market price of 5.03.
* **Moving Averages:** The stock is trading below its 5-day (4.99), 20-day (5.51), and 60-day (5.27) moving averages. This suggests a potential downward trend, with the stock potentially experiencing selling pressure.

* **Relative Divergence:** The negative 20-day relative divergence (-3.67) indicates a potential short-term downward trend. This reinforces the possibility of continued downward pressure.
* **Expected Return:**  A 0.0% expected return signifies that, given the current market conditions, the stock is not expected to outperform the S&P 500 in the long run (2 years or more).
