*   **20-day SMA:** 14.5574
*   **60-day SMA:** 15.4656

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 38.8 (Approaching oversold territory, but not there yet)

*   **Expected Return:** -17.0% (Long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** While the MRI suggests high investment recommendation, other indicators paint a more cautious picture. The RSI is approaching oversold, which could signal a potential rebound, but the negative PPO and declining relative divergence suggest ongoing bearish momentum. The negative expected return indicates that the model predicts it will underperform the S&P 500 in the long term.  The hybrid signal is recommending a buy, which could contradict the negative expected return.
