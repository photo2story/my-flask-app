### 5. Recent Earnings Analysis:

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출        |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2025-08-07 | -0.41 | 0.00 B$     |
| 2025-05-08 | -0.11 | 0.00 B$     |

**Analysis:** The company consistently reports negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) and zero revenue.

### 6. Financial Information:

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30 | \$0.00B | 33.33%       |
| 2024-12-31 | \$0.00B | 60.00%       |
| 2024-09-30 | \$0.00B | 46.43%       |

| 2024-09-30 | \$0.78B | -18.42%   |
| 2024-06-30 | \$0.89B | -13.78%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Despite zero revenue, the company reports positive profit margins. This is unusual and likely reflects the recognition of some form of other income or accounting adjustments (e.g., gains from investments or revaluation).
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable, but ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, indicating losses relative to the company's equity base. The high profit margin with zero revenue is unsustainable.

### 7. Overall Analysis & Recommendation

Joby Aviation (JOBY) is a high-risk, high-reward investment. It is currently underperforming the S&P 500, and faces short-term negative momentum and negative expected return over the long term. The company's financial performance is characterized by no revenue, negative earnings, and negative ROE. Technical indicators suggest caution. The recent news indicates significant activity and volatility.

**Recommendation:** Given the high risk, negative financials, and underperformance, a cautious approach is warranted. The Hybrid signal recommends a high cash position and selling a small portion of holdings. This is speculative investment appropriate only for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon.
