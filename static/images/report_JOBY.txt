*   **5-day SMA:** 14.093
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.572
*   **60-day SMA:** 15.5807

**Analysis:**  The price is currently below the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which may indicate a short-term downward trend. The recent price increase of 4.31% indicates some positive momentum, but it's crucial to see if this is sustained.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 35.23 (Approaching oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.0668 (Positive, but not strongly indicative of a strong trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (6654 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.9 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -17.0 (Negative, indicating a potential decline)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, which seems optimistic given the other indicators.
*   The RSI is approaching oversold territory, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity if other factors align.
*   The negative expected return is a significant red flag, suggesting that analysts anticipate a price decline from the current level. The recent decline in relative divergence confirms this short-term bearish trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a buy, which contradicts the expected return. Further investigation is needed to resolve this contradiction.
*   The 4.31% price change shows volatility.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Mixed News:** The news is mixed, with some analysts being bearish (Goldman Sachs "Sell" rating) and others being bullish (prediction of soaring stock).
*   **Analyst Disagreement:**  There's debate about whether Joby or Archer Aviation is the better investment.
*   **Earnings Focus:**  Some articles focus on earnings potential.

**Analysis:**  The news highlights the speculative nature of the stock.  The "Sell" rating from Goldman Sachs is a significant negative signal that investors should consider.  The disagreement among analysts emphasizes the uncertainty surrounding the company's future.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," indicating a neutral outlook. The average target price ($12.14) is *below* the current price, suggesting potential downside. The wide range between the high and low target prices reflects the uncertainty surrounding the stock. The lack of recent rating changes information makes it difficult to asses any change in sentiment.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출       |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-11-06 | -0.48  | 0.02 B$    |

| 2025-11-06 | -0.21  | 0.00 B$    |

**Analysis:**  Joby is consistently reporting negative EPS (Earnings Per Share), indicating that the company is not yet profitable. Revenue is minimal, even if it increased to 0.02B$. This is typical for a company in the development phase, but it highlights the risk associated with the investment.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

**Overall Assessment: Risky, Speculative Investment**

Joby Aviation is a high-risk, high-reward investment. Here's a summary of the key points:

*   **Positive:**
    *   Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 (historical).
    *   Strong CAGR growth in recent periods.
    *   Recent small revenue increase.
    *   High Market Risk Indicator.
*   **Negative:**
    *   High volatility (high MDD).
    *   Negative expected return.
    *   Negative EPS and ROE.
    *   Analyst consensus is "Hold" with a target price below the current price.
    *   Conflicting signals from MRI and Expected Returns.
    *   Mixed news sentiment, with a "Sell" rating from Goldman Sachs.
    *   Dependence on future success and regulatory approvals.
    *   Company not yet profitable, relying on funding.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is warranted. While Joby has shown potential, the negative earnings, negative expected return, and mixed analyst sentiment suggest that it's a speculative investment with significant downside risk. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in Joby Aviation. The high MRI seems overly optimistic and potentially misleading given the other negative indicators. A "Hold" position seems appropriate.
