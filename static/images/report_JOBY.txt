*   **Weaknesses:** No current revenue generation.  Consistent losses.  High MDD.  Negative expected return. Analyst target prices below the current price. A "Hold" rating with an average target price significantly below the current market price suggests analysts are cautious about the stock's valuation.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, a cautious approach is warranted. While Joby has shown impressive growth and outperformance, its lack of revenue, negative profitability, and high risk profile are significant concerns. The analyst consensus of "Hold" and the negative expected return further temper enthusiasm. It's best to consider the negative sides carefully.
