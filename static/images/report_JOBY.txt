| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -60.0%  | 78.9% | -41.0%  | -0.0   | 2.9    |

| 2023-2025  | 136.0%  | 79.9% | 72.0%   | 0.1    | 14.0   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The CAGR shows a significant recovery and growth trend, especially in the most recent period (2023-2025).
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) across all periods indicates significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values reflect underperformance in earlier periods but substantial outperformance recently, aligning with the CAGR trend.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values close to 0 suggest JOBY's price movement is not highly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). This can be typical for early-stage companies driven by company-specific news.
*   **Cap(B):** The increasing capitalization over time indicates growing investor interest and company development.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movements

*   **Current Price:** 16.10
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 15.67, Previous Close: 15.47, Change: 1.29
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 16.572
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 16.9077
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 15.9778

**Analysis:**  The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but above the 60-day moving average. This suggests a possible short-term downtrend or consolidation after a recent uptrend. The recent market data shows a positive change, indicating a potential rebound.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 49.57 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.1851 (Bearish - suggests short-term weakness)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_80%_Sell 80.0% of holdings (5765 shares - Risky - MRI:0.50)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -5.0 (Short-term decrease in relative outperformance)
*   **Expected Return:** -14.4% (Estimated long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500 if investing from current levels)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a generally positive investment environment, though the hybrid signal advises caution (80% cash position) due to perceived risk.
*   The RSI is neutral.
*   The negative PPO and the negative change in relative divergence suggest some weakening in JOBY's recent performance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Important:** The "change" of 1.29 in the last market data indicates a notable intraday price increase, potentially due to the recent news.  Sudden price movements like this can increase volatility and risk.
*   The negative expected return is concerning and contradicts the high MRI, highlighting the uncertainty around JOBY's long-term prospects.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Positive Catalysts:** News of the Q3 2025 financial results announcement, progress in air taxi development (driving an 11% surge), and positive sentiment in the aerospace sector driven by Archer Aviation's deal with Korean Air are all positive developments.
*   **Valuation Focus:** Articles focusing on Joby's valuation suggest increased scrutiny and potential debate about its current market price.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** News about Lilium's technology being used by Archer highlights the competitive nature of the eVTOL market.

**Analysis:**  Recent news is mixed. There are positive catalysts related to progress and broader industry sentiment, but also articles highlighting valuation concerns and the competitive landscape.

*   **Target Price:** Average: 12.17, High: 22.00, Low: 6.00

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** No revenue is being generated, as expected for a company in this stage.
*   **Profit Margin:** The positive profit margins despite no revenue are likely due to accounting adjustments (e.g., non-cash income) and should not be interpreted as real profitability.
*   **Equity:** Equity levels are fluctuating.
*   **ROE:** Negative ROE values confirm the company is not generating profits on its equity. The substantial drop in ROE in the most recent quarter is a red flag.

### 7. 종합 Analysis (Summary)

Joby Aviation is a high-growth, high-risk company in the eVTOL market.

*   **Positives:** Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, positive news catalysts related to progress in air taxi development, and a high Market Risk Indicator. Increasing capitalization over time indicates growing investor interest and company development.
*   **Negatives:** Lack of revenue, consistently negative earnings, a recent worsening of EPS and ROE, analyst consensus of "Hold" with a target price below the current price, and a negative expected return.  The high MDD across all periods indicates significant volatility and risk.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   The company's valuation appears stretched, given the lack of revenue and negative earnings.
    *   Success depends heavily on regulatory approvals, technological advancements, and market acceptance of eVTOL aircraft.
    *   The competitive landscape is evolving.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the data, a highly speculative investment is recommended. The company has high growth potential, but the risks are substantial. The Hybrid Signal advises caution. The negative expected return, low analyst price target, and lack of revenue suggest potential downside risk. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and rewards before investing in JOBY.
