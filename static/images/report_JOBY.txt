|------------|---------|--------|--------|-------|--------|

The CAGR indicates significant fluctuations in annual returns, with periods of substantial losses and gains. The MDD values are high, reflecting the stock's large price swings.

*   **Previous Close:** $6.88
*   **Change:** +28.78%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.13
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $6.88
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $6.42

**Analysis:** The stock experienced a significant price surge (+28.78%) compared to the previous close. The current price is above all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60 days), indicating a short-term upward trend. The large price movement suggests high volatility or a reaction to recent news.

**3. Technical Indicators and Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 80.20 (Overbought)

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +5.3 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -76.6% (Long-term)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a low-risk environment.  However, the RSI is in overbought territory, indicating the stock might be due for a correction. The PPO is positive, supporting the recent upward trend. The Hybrid Signal suggests a cautious buying strategy with a significant cash position. The positive change in relative divergence indicates short-term upward momentum. The negative expected return over the long term is a major concern, suggesting significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if investing from the current position. The large price change of +28.78% likely contributed to the overbought RSI and should be considered when interpreting the indicators.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis & Summary**

Joby Aviation presents a mixed picture.  Here's a breakdown:

    *   Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
    *   Negative EPS and zero revenue.
    *   Negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500.
    *   High volatility (large MDD).
    *   Negative ROE.

*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   Recent short-term upward price momentum.
    *   MRI indicates Low Risk (though this may not fully reflect the stock's inherent risk).
    *   Hybrid Signal (cautious buying), but this is only a short-term indicator.
    *   Relatively strong profit margins despite generating no revenue.

*   **Neutral Factors:**
    *   Recent News: While suggesting increased activity, the impact is uncertain.
    *   Beta close to zero: Returns are not tied with the overall market

**Conclusion:**

Investing in Joby Aviation appears highly speculative at this point. The company is in the early stages of development, as indicated by the lack of revenue and negative earnings. While recent news and price action may be tempting, the underlying financial metrics suggest caution. The significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, combined with a negative long-term expected return, should be a major concern. Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and opportunities and conduct thorough due diligence before considering an investment. Given the overbought RSI, a short-term pullback is possible. The positive profit margins despite no revenue should be investigated further.
