**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | 199.0%  | 82.0% | 131.0%  | 2.0  | 12.0   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows significant growth potential but with fluctuating performance. The CAGR increases considerably from the 2021-2023 to the 2023-2025 period, indicating accelerating growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Very high drawdown figures consistently above 80% indicate substantial risk and volatility in JOBY's stock.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently positive alpha indicates the stock has generally outperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis, with the most recent period showing substantial outperformance.
*   **Beta:** High beta values (above 1) suggest the stock is more volatile than the market (S&P 500). Beta is increasing over time, meaning the stock is becoming increasingly volatile in relation to the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** Indicates the growth of the company's market capitalization over time, reflecting investor confidence and market valuation.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 13.20
*   **Last-market:** Price: 13.20, Previous Close: 13.22, Change: -0.15
*   **5-day SMA:** 13.62
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.44
*   **60-day SMA:** 15.17

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day).
*   This suggests a short-term downward trend, as the stock is trading below its recent average prices.
*   The negative change in the last market session confirms the recent downward pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO Index, and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 35.14
*   **PPO:** -0.75
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -7.6 (Decreasing)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -41.93%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests medium-to-high suitability for investment based on risk. However, this should be considered alongside other factors.
*   **RSI:**  At 35.14, the RSI indicates that the stock is nearing oversold conditions, which *could* signal a potential for a price rebound (but this is not guaranteed).
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-0.75) indicates a downtrend in the stock price.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 90% of cash" signal suggests a bullish outlook, but with caution (indicated by the "Safe" designation).
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence indicates recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The negative expected return of -41.93% is concerning, suggesting that analysts expect the stock to underperform in the long term compared to the S&P 500, despite the MRI.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Summary:** JOBY is a high-growth, high-risk company in the eVTOL sector. It has outperformed the S&P 500 recently, but faces a number of challenges and uncertainties.
*   **Key Positives:**
    *   Positive Alpha indicates risk-adjusted outperformance.
    *   High growth potential reflected in increasing CAGR.
    *   Hybrid signal supports 90% buy.
*   **Key Negatives:**
    *   Very high volatility and drawdown.
    *   Negative analyst ratings (e.g., Goldman Sachs).
    *   Negative expected return compared to S&P 500.
    *   Negative and declining EPS.
    *   Minimal revenue generation.
    *   Inconsistent analyst opinions and wide range of target prices.
*   **Investment Recommendation:**
    *   Given the high risk and uncertainty, JOBY is not suitable for conservative investors.
    *   Aggressive investors with a long-term investment horizon and a high-risk tolerance might consider a small position, recognizing that the potential for significant gains is accompanied by a high risk of substantial losses.
    *   Thorough due diligence is crucial, including close monitoring of company developments, regulatory approvals, and competitive dynamics in the eVTOL sector.
    *   The contradictory MRI should be taken with a grain of salt and not solely relied upon for investment decisions.
    *   Investors should also consider the potential for dilution through future equity offerings, as the company will likely need to raise additional capital to fund its operations.
