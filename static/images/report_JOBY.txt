**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Joby Aviation has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative return, although the stock is very volatile. Recent news sentiment is mixed, with a negative report from Goldman Sachs potentially driving down the stock price. Analyst consensus is "Hold," but the average target price is below the current price. The company's financial performance is concerning, with consistent negative EPS and ROE. While recent revenue increased, it's not yet at a level to ensure profitability. The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk, but the negative expected return is a red flag.

**Overall:** JOBY is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The company has significant potential in the emerging eVTOL market, but it faces substantial challenges in achieving profitability. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing.
