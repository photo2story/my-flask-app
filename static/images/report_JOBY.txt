    *   **ROE:** The negative Return on Equity (ROE) confirms that the company is not generating profits for its shareholders. The large negative values suggest the company is struggling to use equity to create value.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **High Growth, High Risk:** Joby Aviation exhibits characteristics of a high-growth, high-risk investment. Its stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial volatility, as seen in the maximum drawdown figures.
*   **Unprofitable:** The company is currently unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE. Revenue remains very low, and it has no proven model of generating profit.
*   **Concerning Signals:** The hybrid signal recommending selling 80% of holdings, coupled with the negative expected return, are worrying signs.
*   **Legal Challenges:** The legal battle with Archer adds another layer of uncertainty and risk.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Analyst opinions are divided, with a consensus "Hold" rating and a wide range of price targets. The average target is below the current price, indicating the analysts expect a decline in the share price.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Technical indicators show a possible oversold condition (RSI), but a downward trend based on moving averages.
* **Company Stage:** It is still early in the life cycle of this company.

**Conclusion:** Joby Aviation is a speculative investment. While the company has potential in the long term, it faces significant challenges, including unprofitability, legal issues, and uncertain market conditions. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and potential rewards before investing. A cautious approach is warranted given the negative short-term signals.
