**Overall Analysis:**

EQR's recent earnings performance and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term upward trend, but it's important to consider the stock's significant underperformance against the S&P 500 and its overbought RSI. Investors should monitor these factors closely before making any investment decisions. The company's expected return of 15.12% over 5 years could be attractive to some investors, but it is important to consider the potential risks associated with the stock's current overbought condition and its historical underperformance.
