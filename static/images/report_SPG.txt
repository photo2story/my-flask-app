Here's a comprehensive analysis of Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in owning and operating shopping malls and retail properties.

The cumulative return of SPG (66.12%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (118.37%) by 52.2 percentage points.  The relative underperformance is in the 43.7th percentile of its historical range. This suggests SPG's performance is below average relative to the broader market over the period measured.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently negative alpha values, indicating SPG has underperformed the market (as measured by the benchmark it was compared to), especially between 2018 and 2020. The high beta (around 65) suggests the stock is highly volatile and sensitive to market movements.  Note that the consistent 65.0 beta across different time periods might be an artifact of the data or a simplification. The Max Drawdowns (MDD) are considerable, highlighting significant periods of loss. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies significantly over time reflecting the volatile nature of the investment.

* **60-day Moving Average:** $175.14

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a minor short-term uptrend. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend in the medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.05 – A slightly positive PPO suggests a mild bullish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -2.7 – This indicates a recent short-term downward trend in the stock's relative strength compared to the market.
* **Expected Return:** -70.6% – This significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) suggests considerable caution.  This is a critical point to investigate further. The source and methodology for this number need to be clarified.  A negative expected return over a long term significantly contradicts the historical data provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPG shows strong financial fundamentals with high profit margins and ROE. However, its stock performance significantly underperforms the S&P 500, as indicated by a substantially negative alpha and considerable MDD.  The significantly negative long-term expected return (-70.6%) needs further investigation to confirm its validity. Current technical indicators are mixed, but the price is slightly below its medium-term moving average.  The discrepancy between the strong financials and the poor market performance requires a deeper understanding of the underlying reasons.  Factors to consider include sector-specific headwinds affecting the retail real estate market, macroeconomic conditions, interest rates, and potential company-specific factors that need to be researched from additional data sources not included in this report. Before investing, thorough due diligence and research are necessary to account for the major discrepancies found in this analysis.
