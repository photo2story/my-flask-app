**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns, develops, and manages premier shopping, dining, entertainment, and mixed-use destinations, primarily malls, Premium Outlets, and The Mills.
*   **Return Rate:**
    *   SPG Cumulative Return: 18.39%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 103.21%
    *   Divergence: -84.2 (Relative Divergence: 24.2)

    *   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate fluctuates significantly, with negative growth in most periods and positive growth more recently.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk.
    *   **Alpha:** The Alpha is predominantly negative, suggesting SPG has underperformed relative to its risk (Beta). The recent positive alpha suggests outperformance in the most recent periods.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta is slightly negative, implying that SPG has historically moved slightly inversely to the market.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Cap is fluctuating as shown in the table.
    *   **Interpretation:** This data points to a volatile investment with high risk (high MDD).  The generally negative Alpha suggests that SPG has struggled to deliver returns commensurate with its risk profile (Beta) over the long term. The recent positive CAGR and Alpha for the last few years suggest a potential turnaround.

*   20-day SMA: 183.92
*   60-day SMA: 181.29
