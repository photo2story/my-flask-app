SPG has underperformed the S&P 500 by a significant margin. However, its relative divergence indicates that it is currently in the 19.48th percentile of its historical performance range compared to the S&P 500, suggesting that it may be in a period of relative weakness.

* **PPO:** 0.41 (Bullish)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 1.12 (Short-Term Downward Trend)
* **Expected Return:** 2.68% (Estimated maximum return over 5 years)

The RSI is currently above 80, suggesting that SPG is overbought. However, the PPO indicates bullish momentum. The recent downward trend in relative divergence suggests potential weakness in the short term, though the overall expected return remains positive.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date       | EPS | Revenue |
|------------|-----|---------|
| 2024-07-30 | 3.23 | 3.55 B$ |
| 2024-04-25 | 3.16 | 3.49 B$ |
| 2023-11-02 | 2.34 | 3.08 B$ |
| 2023-07-27 | 1.60 | 3.10 B$ |
| 2024-07-30 | 1.60 | 3.10 B$ |

SPG has consistently exceeded revenue expectations in recent quarters. However, the most recent earnings report (2024-07-30) showed a slight miss in EPS, although still remaining relatively high.  The company's long-term growth prospects are expected to be driven by continued expansion and diversification of its retail portfolio.

**5.  Overall Analysis:**

SPG has significantly underperformed the broader market in recent times. While the recent price action indicates a short-term uptrend, technical indicators suggest the stock is overbought and might be entering a period of weakness. Despite the recent EPS miss, the company continues to show strong revenue growth, indicating a positive outlook for the future.

**6. Conclusion:**

SPG remains a volatile stock with high potential but also significant risk. While the recent earnings report may be a concern, long-term growth prospects remain positive. Investors should monitor the stock closely for signs of a sustained uptrend before making any investment decisions. The current high RSI and downward trend in relative divergence warrant caution.
