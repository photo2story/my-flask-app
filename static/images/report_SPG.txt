Technical indicators suggest the stock may be overbought.  The projected long-term underperformance (-56.5% vs. S&P 500) is a major concern.  Investors should carefully consider the risks associated with SPG before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons for underperformance, and a review of industry trends, would be crucial before forming a comprehensive investment strategy.
