**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, exhibiting negative alpha and fluctuating beta values.

Further analysis is needed given the absence of recent news, market outlook, analyst opinions, and comparison of reported numbers to expectations.  The current price is slightly below its short-term moving averages, suggesting cautious short-term outlook. The RSI value in slightly oversold territory might indicate a potential bounce, but this should be interpreted with caution given the other bearish signals.
