**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $172.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $173.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $174.07
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $175.15

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.38 –  Slightly above the neutral 50 level, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.0342 – Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +0.7 –  Shows a short-term upward trend, potentially a temporary bounce.
* **Expected Return:** -61.0% – This indicates a projected significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming consistent past performance patterns.  Given the negative expected return, a long-term investment in SPG over the S&P 500 would be risky.  The current price of $172.80 does not appear to suggest a significant recent event (sharp rebound or decline) that would drastically alter this projection.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some volatility. While revenue generally increases over time, EPS figures fluctuate.  A more detailed analysis would require a deeper dive into the financial statements to identify the drivers of this fluctuation, for instance, changes in operating costs. Further investigation is needed to determine if the variability reflects seasonality, one-off events, or underlying trends within the business.

**7. Overall Summary:**

SPG's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, exhibiting negative alpha and higher-than-market volatility.  While profitability margins remain strong, recent earnings and equity data shows some inconsistencies requiring further investigation.  Technical indicators point towards a bearish short-term outlook.  The projected long-term underperformance against the S&P 500 (-61%) suggests significant risk for long-term investors.  Before investing in SPG,  a thorough due diligence process is necessary to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and the potential for future improvement.  Considering the projected underperformance, alternative investment opportunities should be explored.
