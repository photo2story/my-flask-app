**6. Overall Conclusion:**

SPG has shown strong historical profitability and a relatively high profit margin. However,  it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent periods. While recent earnings and financial data look strong, the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term raises concerns.  The high MDD values in the alpha/beta analysis warn of significant risk.  Short-term indicators suggest a possible upward trend, but the long-term outlook needs further investigation.  Investors should consider the significant risk and potential for long-term underperformance compared to broader market indices before investing.  Further due diligence, including analysis of sector-specific factors impacting REITs and a thorough review of the company's future plans and outlook, is highly recommended.
