**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term.  While recent price action shows some positive short-term momentum, the negative PPO and relative divergence suggest ongoing bearish pressure.  Earnings data is inconsistent and lacks context. While profitability margins are high, the fluctuating ROE and lack of clear upward trends in EPS and revenue raise concerns.  Additional information (news, market outlook, analyst opinions) is crucial for a more comprehensive analysis. Based solely on the provided data, a long-term investment in SPG relative to the S&P 500 does not appear favorable, with the current data suggesting an expectation of no outperformance.
