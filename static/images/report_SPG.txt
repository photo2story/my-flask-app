## Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) Stock Analysis

**0) Overview:**

Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) is a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership and management of shopping malls and premium outlets across the United States.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

SPG's cumulative return (64.89%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.48%.  The current divergence is -52.6%, placing it at the 43.4th percentile of its historical range (relative divergence). This indicates SPG's underperformance relative to the broader market is considerable but not unprecedented given the historical range of -103.6% to 13.9%.

However, recent years (2021-2025) show positive alpha, suggesting potentially outperformance in the recent market conditions.  The fluctuating Beta indicates sensitivity to market movements changes over time.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -7.0% | 6.2% | -0.1 | 44.0 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 173.41
* **Last Market Price:** 180.35 (Slight increase from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** 174.46
* **20-day Moving Average:** 174.11
* **60-day Moving Average:** 175.95

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The recent slight increase might be a temporary fluctuation.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (51.36):**  Slightly above neutral (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (0.05):**  Positive but close to zero, indicating weak momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-1.8):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-71.2%):** This indicates a significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is a very strong negative signal. The recent price increase of approximately 0.0999 (from 180.17 to 180.35) is not significant enough to override this long-term negative outlook.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 3.12 | 3.58 B$      |
| 2024-07-30 | 3.23 | 3.55 B$      |
| 2024-04-25 | 3.16 | 3.49 B$      |
| 2023-11-02 | 2.34 | 3.08 B$      |
| 2024-10-25 | 2.34 | 3.08 B$      | *(Duplicate entry - possible data error)*


EPS and revenue show some fluctuation but generally remain relatively stable over the reported periods. There appears to be a data duplication issue with the October 25th entry.  Further investigation into the data source is needed to clarify the accuracy.

Equity and ROE show some fluctuation, but overall, ROE remains strong, suggesting efficient use of capital.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

SPG's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 considerably. While the company demonstrates strong profitability and high profit margins, the negative expected return (-71.2%), along with the current price being below its moving averages, paints a bearish picture.  The inconsistent alpha and beta suggest vulnerability to market fluctuations.  Before considering any investment, further investigation is warranted to address data inconsistencies and assess the long-term prospects of the company, considering factors beyond the provided data.  The extremely negative projected return relative to the market should be a major cause for concern.
