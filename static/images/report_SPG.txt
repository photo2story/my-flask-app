    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period, indicating risk. High MDDs (e.g., 66.4%) suggest significant volatility.
    *   **Alpha:** Measures the stock's performance relative to its expected return, given its beta. Consistently negative Alpha values during certain periods (e.g., -73% in 2019-2021) suggest underperformance relative to its risk profile. More recently the alpha improved significantly, going into positive territory for 2021-2023.

Higher Beta values (e.g., 1.3-1.5) suggest greater volatility. SPG's Beta has generally been close to or slightly above 1.0, suggesting that it tends to be more volatile than the S&P 500. The Beta values have decreased somewhat recently.

*   20-day SMA: 184.9285
*   60-day SMA: 182.1072

*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but above the 60-day moving average. This suggests a potential short-term downward trend but a longer-term upward trend. The `change` value indicates a minor price decrease in the last market day.

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 52.36 (Neutral)
*   PPO: -0.1594 (Slightly Bearish)

*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -0.3 (Short-term decline)
*   Expected Return (%): -111.8

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI of 52.36 is in a neutral territory, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests that the shorter-term moving average is slightly below the longer-term moving average, indicating a slightly bearish trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal suggests a strong buy recommendation according to the system, although is is stated to be only a single share, and that cash should be 0%.
    *   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence indicates a short-term decline in performance relative to the comparison stock.
    *   **Expected Return:** The very low expected return of -111.8% is deeply concerning and suggests the model anticipates significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a 2-year period, if an investment is made now.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** SPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period. The large negative expected return of -111.8% is a major red flag.
*   **Volatility:** Beta suggests that SPG has a tendency to be more volatile than the overall market.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Recent stock price movements are mixed. The price is above the 60-day SMA, and below the 5-day and 20-day SMA. Analyst consensus is buy, but with significant divergence in predicted prices. There is also a negative change in short term relative divergence.
*   **Positive Fundamentals:**  Revenue and profit margins are strong and have generally been increasing.
*   **Concerns:** Declining equity and highly negative expected returns compared to the S&P 500 are key warning signs.
*   **News Impact:** Recent news events are mixed, indicating refinancing (potentially positive), institutional investment (positive), analyst price target (neutral), downgrade of preferred stock (negative), and an article about retaining the stock (positive).
*   **Recommendation:** While the recent earnings and revenue are promising, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the concerning expected return suggest caution. A high degree of skepticism is recommended and it may be recommended to avoid investment at this time, pending further investigation into the expected underperformance and decline in Equity. It would be important to understand *why* the model forecasts such poor returns, despite the superficially strong recent revenue, profitability, and analyst ratings.
