**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPG has demonstrated significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  While profitability and margins are strong, the negative alpha, high beta, and the extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the market raise serious concerns.  The recent price movement shows some short-term upward pressure but is below longer-term moving averages. The -70.6% expected return requires thorough investigation to understand the underlying assumptions and methodology.   Further research is needed to determine if this severe underperformance is temporary or reflects a more fundamental issue with the company's prospects.  The duplicate earnings data needs clarification. Before any investment decision, a thorough review of the company's long-term strategy and competitive landscape is crucial.  The high predicted negative return warrants extreme caution.
