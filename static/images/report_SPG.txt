## Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) Stock Analysis Report

**Executive Summary:** Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in shopping malls, has exhibited a cumulative return significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period. While recent performance shows positive momentum, several indicators suggest a cautious approach.  Further analysis is needed to determine the long-term investment potential.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SPG's cumulative return (75.96%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's return (121.84%), resulting in a substantial negative divergence (-45.9%).  This places SPG at the 49.1st percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500, indicating underperformance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance relative to the market.  While recent years (2021-2025) show positive alpha, indicating outperformance, earlier periods show negative alpha and high beta (market sensitivity).  The significant variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) underscores the volatility associated with SPG.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is $185.05.  Short-term momentum appears positive, with the price trading above both the 5-day ($184.02) and 20-day ($177.69) moving averages, and significantly above the 60-day moving average ($176.80).


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (68.02):** Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.63):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent positive change in relative divergence (1.3) points to short-term upward pressure.
* **Expected Return (-57.7%):** This significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term raises serious concerns about the long-term investment viability of SPG compared to the market index.  This necessitates a detailed review of the underlying assumptions of this prediction.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings have been relatively stable, showing slight fluctuations in both EPS and revenue.  There is no clear upward or downward trend discernible from this limited data.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 3.12 | 3.58 B$       |
| 2024-07-30 | 3.23 | 3.55 B$       |
| 2024-04-25 | 3.16 | 3.49 B$       |
| 2023-11-02 | 2.34 | 3.08 B$       |
| 2024-10-25 | 2.34 | 3.08 B$       | *(Duplicate entry - possible data error)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of crucial financial data like Total Revenue and Gross Profit significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  Further investigation is required to obtain this missing information.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500, although recent price action and some technical indicators suggest short-term positive momentum.  However, the negative long-term expected return, coupled with the lack of crucial financial data and historical volatility, warrants caution.  A thorough review of the -57.7% expected return calculation and further financial data are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity, making SPG a riskier investment than the broader market.
