| 2019-2021  | -6.0% | 59.0% | -60.0% | 50.0 |

| 2023-2025  | 19.0% | 70.2% | 0.6 | 54.2 |

The table shows inconsistent performance with both positive and negative CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD), and fluctuating Alpha and Beta values.  The high Beta consistently indicates significant sensitivity to market movements.  The negative Alpha in most periods suggests underperformance relative to the market benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $143.74
* **Last Price:** $143.78
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $155.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $162.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $171.81

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The small positive daily change is not significant enough to reverse this trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 27.47 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.13 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.5 (Short-term upward movement, but within a broader downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -71.9% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a significant concern.)

The technical indicators suggest bearish momentum and oversold conditions.  The small positive change in the 20-day relative divergence indicates a minor short-term uptick, but it's not sufficient to overcome the overall negative trend. The extremely negative expected return is alarming.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 3.12    | $3.58 B     |

| 2024-10-25 | 2.34    | $3.08 B     | *(Duplicate entry - potential data error)*


There seems to be a duplicated entry for October 25, 2024.  Ignoring the duplicate, EPS and revenue show relatively stable performance in recent quarters. However, this needs further investigation to account for the potential data entry error.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500, showing a large negative return difference.  Technical indicators point to bearish momentum and oversold conditions.  While the company's financial statements suggest strong profitability and a healthy financial position, the extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 raises serious concerns.  The high Beta indicates significant market risk. Further investigation is needed to resolve the data inconsistency in the earnings data. Before making any investment decision, a thorough review of the company's future prospects and potential catalysts for improvement is essential. The current situation warrants caution.  Given the extremely negative expected return, a long-term investment strategy in SPG would need to be carefully considered against the risks involved.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential upside against the very significant downside risk indicated by the analysis.
