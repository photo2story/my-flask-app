## Simon Property Group Inc (SPG) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

SPG, Simon Property Group Inc., is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focusing on shopping malls and retail properties.  The following analysis reviews SPG's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) based on provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **SPG Cumulative Return:** 36.60%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 82.57%
* **Return Difference:** -45.97%  (SPG underperformed VOO by approximately 46 percentage points)
* **Relative Divergence:** -46.0 (52.3% percentile within historical range of -113.4% to 15.4%)  This indicates that SPG's current underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is significant but not unprecedented based on the historical data provided.

The provided alpha and beta analysis show mixed results across different periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others show significant negative alpha, especially in 2021-2023.  The beta consistently remains high, indicating a substantial correlation with the overall market. The significant fluctuations in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlight the volatility associated with SPG's performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $156.20
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $151.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $153.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $167.37

The closing price is above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term positive momentum. However, it's significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend over the longer term. The recent price change of $1.91 from the previous close shows a modest daily increase.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 53.04 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.73 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.4 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -57.0% (This is a remarkably negative figure.  Clarification is needed on how this figure was calculated and its basis.  It suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term period. It contradicts the 36.6% gain that is provided elsewhere)

The relatively low Market Risk Indicator combined with the positive PPO suggests moderate risk and some underlying strength in the stock. However, the negative expected return warrants further investigation.  The price increase is modest and not indicative of a significant 'sharp rebound' or 'sharp fall' despite a modest 1.91 USD gain (1.25%) over the previous day.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |

Equity shows some fluctuation. ROE (Return on Equity) is generally high, indicating efficient use of shareholder capital, though it shows some variability quarter to quarter.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG shows a mixed performance. While its high profit margins and strong profitability indicators are positive, its significant underperformance against the S&P 500 over the given period and the alarmingly negative expected return (requiring further clarification) raise serious concerns. The relatively high beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  Further analysis is needed to reconcile the conflicting information regarding expected returns.  The data quality needs review to ensure accuracy (duplicate earnings data).  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the -57% expected return and the recent price action is required for a comprehensive investment decision.  The information available alone is not enough to provide a definitive recommendation.
