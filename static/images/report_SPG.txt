## Simon Property Group Inc (SPG) Stock Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

Simon Property Group Inc (SPG) is a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in owning, managing, and developing retail real estate properties.  This report analyzes SPG's performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), using provided financial data and technical indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

SPG's cumulative return (64.89%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's return (117.48%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -52.6%, placing it at the 43.4th percentile of its historical range (max: 13.9%, min: -103.6%).  While the alpha values fluctuate across years, the consistently high beta (generally around 40-50) indicates high sensitivity to market movements.  This suggests that while SPG has delivered positive returns in some periods, its performance is strongly correlated with the overall market, and hasn't consistently outperformed it.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -7.0% | 6.2% | -0.1 | 44.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

SPG's closing price is $173.41.  It's currently trading below its 5-day ($174.46), 20-day ($174.11), and 60-day ($175.95) moving averages, suggesting a slight downward trend in the short-term. The recent price change of -$0.26 indicates a minor decrease compared to the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (51.36):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (0.05):** A slightly positive PPO value suggests a potential bullish momentum, though it's relatively weak.
* **Relative Strength Divergence (-1.8):**  The negative value indicates a short-term downward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-71.2%):** This alarmingly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a significant concern. This figure needs further investigation and clarification of its calculation method.  The small recent price drop does not account for such a large negative expected return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility. While revenue generally increased quarter-over-quarter, EPS shows some fluctuation. There's an apparent data duplication for October 25th, 2024.  Further investigation is needed to clarify this discrepancy and obtain a clearer picture of earnings trends.

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 3.12 | 3.58 B$    |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable, with slight fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high (above 80%), indicating strong profitability.  Equity has shown some variability. ROE fluctuates, although generally remaining high, highlighting the company's ability to generate returns on shareholder investment.  However, the declining equity in recent quarters needs closer examination.

|-------------|---------|---------------|---------|---------|

| 2023-09-30  | $1.41B  | 80.53%        | $2.95B  | 20.15%  |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

SPG's performance has been significantly underperforming the broader market, particularly concerning the strongly negative projected long-term return. While profitability and margins are high, the data suggests caution.  The consistently high beta underscores market sensitivity, while the recent price movement and technical indicators paint a mixed picture.  The discrepancies in the earnings data require clarification.  Before making any investment decisions, further research is crucial to understand the factors driving the -71.2% expected return and to investigate the duplicated earnings data point.  A thorough review of the company's future prospects and potential catalysts is necessary to assess the long-term viability of an investment in SPG.
