The cumulative return for SPG is 66.65%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 115.41%.  Therefore, SPG underperformed VOO by 48.8 percentage points as of the last day of the provided data.  The relative divergence of -48.8% places SPG in the lower 46.6% percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently negative alpha (-0.1) across all periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  Beta values fluctuate between 26 and 65, suggesting high market sensitivity.  While the CAGR shows positive returns in some years, the significant negative returns in certain periods highlight considerable risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $174.69
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $174.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $174.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $175.13

The price is slightly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  However, it's relatively close to both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating price stability in the recent period.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 39.96 – Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.06 – A positive value suggests upward momentum, but it is very close to zero, implying weak momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.2 – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -63.5% – This suggests significantly lower returns compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is a substantial underperformance and warrants careful consideration.  Given the large negative expected return, the current price of $174.69 does not appear to reflect any significant short-term upward movement (no indication of a rapid rebound).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility.  While revenue generally shows an upward trend (with a minor dip in Q4 2023), EPS is inconsistent. There's no clear pattern of continuous growth in EPS.  Direct comparison to expected earnings is not possible without providing expected figures.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue remains relatively stable, hovering around $1.4-1.5B per quarter.  Profit margins are consistently high (80-84%), indicating strong profitability.  However, there's some minor fluctuation quarter over quarter.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown some fluctuation, and ROE (Return on Equity) is highly variable, ranging from 16.79% to 24.76%.  This variability necessitates further investigation into the underlying causes.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information about recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  No such data is provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPG has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the period analyzed. While the company shows high profit margins and relatively stable revenue, EPS is volatile and the long-term expected return is drastically negative against the S&P 500. The RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, but the weak PPO and negative expected return raise concerns.  Further analysis is needed, incorporating missing information such as recent news, analyst ratings, and expected earnings to provide a complete picture.  The high beta suggests high market sensitivity, meaning SPG is subject to significant swings alongside broader market fluctuations.  The negative alpha consistently demonstrates underperformance relative to the market.

**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, SPG presents a high-risk, high-reward profile. While the company demonstrates strong profitability, its underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the significant negative expected return are major concerns.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more definitive conclusion.  Additional information is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Consider consulting a financial advisor before investing.
