**7. 종합적인 요약 (Overall Summary)**

Simon Property Group (SPG) is showing mixed signals.

*   **Negatives:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, a very negative long-term expected return, high MDD, and often negative Alpha suggest potential risks.
*   **Positives:** Recent earnings and revenue have shown a upward trend, the current Market Risk Indicator (MRI) is low, profit margins are high, and there's been a slight short-term increase in relative divergence.
*   **Important Considerations:** Recent news indicates potential volatility and significant events that require further investigation.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data provided, a cautious approach to SPG is warranted. The long-term expected underperformance is a major red flag. While recent earnings and revenue trends are encouraging, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, volatile historical performance, and recent news events suggest that investors should conduct thorough due diligence before investing in SPG. Monitoring specific news and company announcements will be crucial. The Hybrid Signal recommendation to buy with caution aligns with this assessment.
