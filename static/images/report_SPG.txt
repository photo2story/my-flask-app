*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows periods of negative growth, particularly from 2018-2022. More recently, growth has been positive, even strong in the last period.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for substantial losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is mostly negative, meaning SPG has generally underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.  There are positive Alpha values in recent periods.
*   **Beta:** Beta is near zero or negative in most periods.  A Beta of zero indicates that SPG's price movements are largely uncorrelated with the overall market.  A negative beta suggests it moves in the *opposite* direction of the market, which is unexpected for a REIT.
*   **Cap(B):** This represents the capitalization in billions. The large drop in 2018-2020 period, with recovery after that.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 187.71
*   **Last-market:** price: 187.62, previousClose: 187.71, change: -0.05
*   **5-day SMA:** 187.04
*   **20-day SMA:** 183.92
*   **60-day SMA:** 181.29

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly down from its previous close. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, and the 20-day is above the 60-day. This suggests a short-term upward trend. The close value is above all SMAs, confirming that recent price is above the average of the short-term, mid-term, and long-term historical price.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 67.27
*   **PPO:** 0.27
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-19)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.2 (+) 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -202.7

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator is high (0.9), suggesting a favorable investment environment, according to this indicator. However, it's crucial to consider other factors.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 67.27 indicates that the stock is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), suggesting a potential pullback.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being at 0.27 is a relatively small number and indicates that short-term exponential moving average is slightly above the long-term exponential moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying 90% of available cash (2 shares), which signals positive buying opportunity.
*   **Recent divergence change:** The positive change in relative divergence over the past 20 days confirms the short-term upward trend suggested by the moving averages.
*   **Expected Return:** The highly negative expected return (-202.7%) is concerning and suggests that, based on the model, long-term investment at the current price is unlikely to generate positive returns. *This is a critical point.* This indicator strongly suggests *avoiding* long-term investment in SPG at current prices.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive articles:**
    *   "Here's Why it Is Wise to Retain SPG Stock in Your Portfolio Now"
    *   "Burney Co. Buys 10,553 Shares of Simon Property Group, Inc."
    *   "Insider Purchase: Director at $SPG Buys 588 Shares"
*   **Neutral/Technical articles:**
    *   "Trading the Move, Not the Narrative: (SPG) Edition"
    *   "YieldBoost SPG To 15.8% Using Options"
*   **Potentially irrelevant articles:**
    *   "What analysts say about Springer Nature AG Co KGaA SPG stock" (This appears to be a different company with a similar ticker.)

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. Some articles suggest a positive outlook ("Wise to Retain," insider buying), while others focus on technical trading strategies. The article about Springer Nature appears to be an error. It's essential to verify that news articles are indeed about Simon Property Group and not other companies with similar tickers. The insider purchase is a positive sign, as insiders typically buy shares when they believe the stock is undervalued.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.29, Opinions: 20)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 194.05 / 225.00 / 175.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** (No changes provided)

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus is generally positive ("Buy"). The average target price of $194.05 is slightly above the current price, suggesting potential upside. However, the range between the high and low targets ($225 and $175) indicates some disagreement among analysts.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출        |
|------------|------|-------------|

**Analysis:**

*   Earnings Per Share (EPS) and revenue have generally been increasing over the reported period, with a significant jump in the most recent quarter (2025-10-30). This indicates strong recent performance.
*   The duplicate entry for 2025-10-30 with older EPS and Revenue figures looks like an error that needs to be addressed.

| 2024-09-30   | $2.71B   | 17.54% |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue has shown a generally increasing trend, although there is some fluctuation.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are consistently high (above 80%), indicating strong operational efficiency.
*   **Equity:** Equity has been decreasing over the past few quarters.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile, with a recent spike in the last quarter. A high ROE is generally desirable, but the decrease in equity should be monitored.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Underperformance:** SPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 historically.
*   **Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility (high MDD).
*   **Recent Positive Momentum:** Recent data suggests some positive momentum: the short-term SMA is trending upward, the RSI is approaching overbought, and recent news includes insider buying. However, these are short-term indicators.
*   **Strong Earnings and Profitability:** Recent earnings and revenue are strong, and profit margins are consistently high.
*   **Concerning Expected Return:** The extremely negative "Expected Return" figure is a major red flag. It suggests that the model used to generate this figure predicts significant future underperformance.
*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Model Pessimism:** Analysts have a "Buy" consensus and a target price slightly above the current price. This contrasts sharply with the negative Expected Return.
*   **Decreasing Equity**: Equity has decreased, while ROE has spiked recently. The cause of decreased equity should be examined.

**Conclusion:**

The analysis presents a mixed picture. SPG shows recent positive momentum, strong earnings, and analyst optimism. *However, the extremely negative "Expected Return" and historical underperformance are major concerns.* A potential investor should investigate the reason behind the negative Expected Return and consider it carefully before making any investment decisions. Also, the decreasing Equity should be further investigated.
