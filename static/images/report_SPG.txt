|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2015-2017  | 6.0% | 0.0% | 3.0% | 0.4 | 64.8 | **Positive Performance:** SPG shows a positive CAGR and Alpha, with low risk (0.0% MDD) and a moderate Beta, indicating it is less volatile than the market during this period.                                                                                                           |
| 2016-2018  | 5.0% | 58.0% | 10.0% | 0.0 | 63.4 | **Volatile Performance:** Despite a positive Alpha, the high MDD indicates significant volatility. The low Beta suggests that the stock's movements are not correlated with the market.                                                                                                 |
| 2017-2019  | -4.0% | 58.0% | -27.0% | 0.0 | 56.2 | **Poor Performance:** Negative CAGR and a large negative Alpha indicate underperformance compared to the market, coupled with high volatility.                                                                                                                                             |
| 2018-2020  | -46.0% | 59.0% | -73.0% | -0.0 | 32.2 | **Significant Underperformance:** A very negative CAGR and Alpha, with high MDD, suggest significant losses and high risk during this period.                                                                                                                                          |
| 2019-2021  | -8.0% | 59.0% | -57.0% | -0.1 | 60.3 | **Underperformance:** The stock continues to underperform with a negative CAGR and Alpha, though the Beta remains low.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2020-2022  | -2.0% | 61.9% | -8.0% | -0.1 | 44.3 | **Marginal Underperformance:** Only slight losses and a negative Alpha still indicate underperformance, with continued high volatility.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 2021-2023  | 54.0% | 63.1% | 34.0% | -1.2 | 53.8 | **Strong Recovery:** SPG shows a strong turnaround with a high CAGR and Alpha, though volatility remains high. A negative Beta suggests that the stock moves inversely to the market, which is unusual.                                                                                 |
| 2022-2024  | 34.0% | 70.4% | 8.0% | -1.0 | 65.0 | **Continued Positive Performance:** SPG maintains a strong CAGR and positive Alpha, although the MDD is very high, reflecting significant risk. A negative Beta continues to indicate inverse correlation with the market.                                                            |
| 2023-2025  | 33.0% | 70.4% | -18.0% | 0.8 | 65.1 | **Mixed Performance:** Despite a strong CAGR, a negative Alpha indicates underperformance relative to the market. High MDD and a positive Beta suggest higher market correlation and risk, but the underperformance relative to the market is a concern despite the high growth rate. |

**Analysis Summary:**

*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha values for many periods indicate that SPG has generally underperformed the S&P 500 during those times, except for the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods.
*   **Beta:** Fluctuations in Beta suggest varying degrees of correlation with the market. Negative Beta values in recent periods (2021-2025) suggest that SPG's price moves inversely to the market, which could be seen as a hedge during market downturns but also means SPG might not fully participate in market rallies.
*   **MDD:** The high Maximum Drawdown values indicate significant volatility and risk, particularly in more recent years.
*   **CAGR:** The wide range in CAGR values indicates substantial fluctuations in annual growth rates, making long-term projections difficult without deeper analysis into specific market conditions and company strategies during those periods.
