**6. Summary:**

SPG displays strong profitability and high revenue but has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the analyzed period. While recent years show periods of high growth and positive alpha, consistent outperformance is not guaranteed. The current price action suggests a downtrend, with technical indicators offering mixed signals.  The negative expected return suggests that SPG is not expected to beat the broader market in the long term.  Further investigation into the data discrepancies (duplicate earnings entry) is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Considering the risk profile, the current investment decision needs careful consideration.
