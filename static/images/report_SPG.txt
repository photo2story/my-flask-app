## Simon Property Group Inc (SPG) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Simon Property Group Inc (SPG), a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in shopping malls and retail properties, shows a cumulative return significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period. While recent quarterly earnings and financial information indicate strong profitability, the stock's underperformance relative to the market warrants further investigation.  Its recent price action shows a downward trend.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SPG's cumulative return of 33.59% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's 76.18% return.  The provided divergence data (-42.6%, 55.0% relative) indicates SPG's underperformance is substantial relative to its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500.

The alpha/beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance against the market (S&P 500).  While positive CAGR is observed in several periods, the negative alpha values in most years signify underperformance relative to the benchmark.  The beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying sensitivity to market movements. High MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures further highlight the risk involved.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 7.0% | 65.0% | -25.0% | 43.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 11.0% | 57.9% | -10.0% | 44.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 3.0% | 57.9% | 0.5 | 41.7 |
| 2018-2020  | -39.0% | 58.6% | -0.1 | 25.6 |
| 2019-2021  | -1.0% | 58.8% | -0.1 | 50.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -1.0% | 72.9% | -0.8 | 39.1 |
| 2021-2023  | 66.0% | 72.9% | -2.1 | 50.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 44.0% | 72.9% | -1.9 | 64.1 |

**2. Recent Price Action:**

SPG's closing price is $150.4.  The stock price is trading below its 5-day ($149.18), 20-day ($156.26), and 60-day ($168.80) moving averages, indicating a downward trend. The recent price increase of $1.59 from the previous close suggests some short-term recovery, but it remains below key moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk) suggests moderate market volatility.
* **RSI:** 38.59, below 40, suggests the stock is oversold.
* **PPO:** -0.0527, negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** 1.9 (+), indicating a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -52.2%.  This extremely negative expected return, compared to the S&P 500, indicates a significant downside risk over the long term (2+ years).  The large negative change needs more in-depth analysis; considering the high beta, it could be a result of market downturn amplification for SPG.  Further investigation is needed to understand this negative expectation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG's strong financial performance (high profit margins, healthy ROE) contrasts with its underperformance against the S&P 500. The negative expected return is a major concern and requires further investigation. The current price action suggests a bearish trend.  While the company's fundamentals appear solid, external factors (market sentiment, interest rate changes, sector-specific challenges) could be significantly impacting SPG's stock price.  A deeper dive into these external factors and a more robust risk assessment are necessary to provide a comprehensive evaluation. The duplicate earnings data needs to be clarified.  Further analysis, including a review of industry benchmarks and macroeconomic factors, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
