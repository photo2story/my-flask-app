**6) Overall Analysis:**

SPG's financial health appears strong, with high profit margins and ROE. However, its stock performance significantly lags the S&P 500, raising concerns. While recent periods show some improvement, the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant red flag.  The mixed signals from technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) warrant further investigation and caution.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the underperformance relative to the market, as well as a clearer understanding of the methodology behind the expected return calculation, are crucial before making any investment decisions.  This analysis highlights the need for more detailed fundamental and qualitative analysis to assess the long-term investment potential of SPG.  Consideration should be given to the evolving retail landscape and SPG’s ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences.
