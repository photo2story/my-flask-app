**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of total revenue and gross profit data significantly limits the ability to conduct a thorough financial analysis.  Key financial ratios cannot be calculated without this information.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

SPG's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500, though recent months have shown improvement.  Technical indicators suggest a possible short-term upward trend, but the overbought RSI signals caution. The negative long-term expected return against the S&P 500 is a major concern.  The lack of critical financial data prevents a robust assessment of the company's financial health and future prospects.  Further research, including acquiring complete financial statements, is crucial for a more comprehensive and reliable evaluation.
