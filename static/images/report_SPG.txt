**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPG demonstrates strong profitability and high profit margins. However, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period and the projected long-term return is significantly negative. The negative alpha and high beta suggest consistent underperformance relative to the market with higher volatility.  The recent price movement shows a slight downward trend. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the negative long-term expected return, the fluctuation in ROE, and the inconsistencies in the earnings data. Before investing, it is strongly recommended to conduct thorough due diligence, including an in-depth analysis of the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape, considering the substantial underperformance compared to market indices.  The duplicate data entry needs to be rectified to allow for proper analysis.  A careful risk assessment is also critical given the higher than average volatility.
