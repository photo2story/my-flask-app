*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth rate over each period.  Notice the significant negative CAGR during the 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 periods, reflecting potential challenges related to the retail environment (e.g., pandemic impacts). CAGR has improved in more recent periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. The high MDD values (above 60%) suggest significant volatility and potential risk.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the excess return compared to the benchmark (S&P 500) after accounting for risk. Negative Alpha values dominate, indicating underperformance relative to the market. The more recent periods show some positive Alpha, suggesting improved performance.
*   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. Beta values consistently below 0 suggests that SPG's price movements are less sensitive to market fluctuations.
*   **Cap(B):** Shows market capitalization.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Current Price: 187.71
*   Previous Close: 188.29

*   5-day SMA: 187.038
*   20-day SMA: 183.9243
*   60-day SMA: 181.2918

*   **Analysis:** The stock price closed slightly lower than its previous close. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term upward trend, although the short-term price decline slightly contradicts it.

**3) Market Risk Indicator (MRI) and Other Indicators**

*   MRI: 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   RSI: 67.27 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   PPO: 0.27
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = 1.2 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   Expected Return (%): -202.7 (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A high MRI (1.0) suggests the model indicates a favorable investment environment for the stock based on the model's risk assessment. However, the other factors should be considered.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI of 67.27 is approaching the overbought level (typically above 70), which could indicate a potential pullback.
    *   **PPO:** The PPO indicator could be interpreted as a bullish signal. However, PPO should be viewed in association with RSI.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** Suggests a strong buy with 90% cash allocation.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:**  A positive change indicates that SPG is currently outperforming the S&P 500 in the short term, potentially due to some specific event.
    *   **Expected Return:**  The significantly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 suggests that the model has a negative outlook on SPG's long-term prospects relative to the broader market.  This should be interpreted cautiously, as such large negative values can indicate model instability or specific conditions.
    *   **Price Change Note:** The recent price change of -0.31 should be considered in association with RSI and PPO.
