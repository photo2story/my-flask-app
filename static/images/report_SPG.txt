## Simon Property Group Inc (SPG) Stock Analysis Report

**0) Executive Summary:**

Simon Property Group Inc (SPG), a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in shopping malls, has shown a cumulative return of 73.94% since the benchmark period, lagging behind the S&P 500's (VOO) 108.99% return.  While recent performance shows strong growth (59% CAGR from 2021-2023),  it's essential to consider its high beta and historical underperformance against the market.  Current short-term price movements indicate potential volatility, while long-term prospects warrant careful consideration of its high profit margins and strong recent earnings, against the backdrop of a relatively high expected return relative to VOO.

**1) Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SPG's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by -35.1 percentage points.  The relative underperformance (-35.1) places it at the 58.3rd percentile of the historical range (-103.6% to 13.9%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results.  While recent years (2021-2025) show positive alpha, indicating outperformance, earlier periods show negative alpha, demonstrating underperformance against the market.  The consistently high beta (mostly above 40) highlights SPG's high sensitivity to market fluctuations.  This underscores the risk associated with investing in SPG.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

SPG's closing price is $183.58.  The price decreased by $2.24 (-1.19%) compared to the previous close.  Moving averages suggest a potentially bearish trend in the short-term:

* 60-day MA: $177.79


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (48.18):**  Near the neutral level (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (-0.11):** Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):**  A positive change of +5.4 points suggests short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (-42.2%):**  This significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a major concern.  It suggests that SPG's projected future performance is expected to significantly underperform the market.  Further analysis is needed to ascertain the basis of this projection.

SPG presents a complex investment case.

The recent price movement shows some short-term volatility.  A long-term investment decision requires a thorough assessment of the company's future growth prospects, considering the macroeconomic environment and its susceptibility to market fluctuations.  The discrepancies in the data provided (duplicate earnings entry) also necessitate further verification of data accuracy before making any investment decisions.  Independent research and professional financial advice are strongly recommended.
