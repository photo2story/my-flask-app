|--------------|-----------|---------|
| 2025-09-30   | $2.35B    | 25.83%  |
| 2025-06-30   | $2.45B    | 22.72%  |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has generally increased. Profit margins are consistently very high. Equity has decreased. ROE has fluctuated, but is generally strong. The decreasing equity combined with strong ROE indicates the company may be utilizing debt, buybacks or dividends to increase the rate of return for shareholders.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Based on the provided information, Simon Property Group (SPG) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. High Maximum Drawdown indicates significant risk.  Negative historical Alpha.  RSI suggests overbought conditions.  **Very negative Expected Return suggests significant future underperformance (model-based prediction).** A recent analyst opinion suggests a competitor REIT is better.
*   **Positives:** Analyst consensus is a "Buy" rating. Recent earnings and revenue show some growth. Profit margins are high. A new rewards program could be a positive catalyst.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The extremely negative Expected Return is a major red flag. While analysts have a positive outlook, and recent financials appear strong, the historical underperformance, high risk, and model-predicted future underperformance outweigh the positives. **Therefore, based solely on the data provided, a cautious approach is warranted.** Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative expected return and the company's future prospects is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions. The accuracy of the model providing the Expected Return should be verified.
