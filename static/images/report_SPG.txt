* **20-Day Moving Average:** $176.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $170.98

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting recent minor price consolidation. It is, however, above both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating an upward trend in the short-to-medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (71.99):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.13):** A positive value indicates bullish momentum, but relatively low magnitude.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+3.37):** Shows a recent increase in relative strength.  The positive change and above-average moving averages suggest a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided 0.0% expected return needs further clarification, specifying the methodology and timeframe used.  A 0% long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is highly unusual.  Further analysis and comparison to other REITs are needed to accurately assess the long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent Financials and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows relatively stable revenue, but EPS has shown some recent volatility. Further analysis is needed to determine if there are seasonal factors impacting these numbers.  The significant difference between the October 25th EPS values requires explanation.  Crucially, the earnings reports lack details about the expected earnings â€“ this is a major gap in the data.  Providing the anticipated earning figures for comparison is vital for an accurate analysis.


**5. Quarterly Financial Data:**

The financial data shows consistent revenue and high profit margins throughout the reported quarters.  ROE fluctuates but is generally strong. This consistency suggests a financially healthy company, although a deeper dive into individual line items (e.g., operating expenses, debt levels) would strengthen this assessment.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires information from recent news sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD.  Please provide relevant news articles for a comprehensive analysis.  The report will be incomplete without this crucial information.)*  The absence of up-to-date news significantly limits the accuracy of this analysis.  Recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights are critical for a current assessment.


**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

SPG has demonstrated significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the specified period. While recent price action suggests a short-term upward trend supported by moving averages, technical indicators suggest a potential near-term correction. Financial data displays consistent revenue and profitability but requires further investigation to determine the drivers of the fluctuations in EPS and ROE.  Crucially, the absence of recent news and details regarding EPS expectations leaves a large knowledge gap in this analysis. A clear picture of SPG's future prospects requires further investigation of recent news and more complete financial reporting.

**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data provided, a definitive conclusion is difficult. SPG's performance relative to the broader market requires further evaluation, considering external factors and more detailed financial statements. The inclusion of recent news, analyst opinions, and clarification on the expected return and EPS figures would substantially improve the robustness of this analysis.
