* **20-Day Moving Average:** $153.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $167.37

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend, although the recent price jump could indicate a shift.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 53.04 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.73 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -2.4% (Short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -57.0% (This indicates that over a long-term horizon (2+ years), SPG is expected to underperform the S&P 500 significantly.  The negative return is concerning. Further investigation into the underlying assumptions of this estimate is warranted)


Given the recent price increase of $1.83, this might indicate a short-term rebound rather than a sustained upward trend, especially given the other indicators.



**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-04-29 | 3.55 | $3.78B        |
| 2024-10-25 | 3.12 | $3.58B        |
| 2024-07-30 | 3.23 | $3.55B        |
| 2024-04-25 | 3.16 | $3.49B        |
| 2025-04-29 | 3.16 | $3.49B        |


There's a discrepancy in the provided data, with two entries for 2025-04-29.  Assuming the first entry is correct, EPS and revenue show some fluctuation. A more detailed analysis would require examining the growth rates and comparing them to industry averages.  The April 2025 EPS is higher than the previous quarters, suggesting potential positive momentum but this needs further analysis.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

SPG has shown significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, as evidenced by the negative alpha and the large cumulative return difference.  While recent earnings show some positive signs, and the profit margins are consistently high, the negative long-term expected return and the relatively high beta suggest substantial market risk. The recent price jump needs to be viewed cautiously.  Further investigation into the drivers of the -57% expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A thorough analysis of industry trends and SPG's competitive position is recommended before considering an investment.  The data suggests SPG may not be a suitable investment for risk-averse investors seeking market-beating returns.
