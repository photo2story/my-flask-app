This report analyzes Simon Property Group Inc (SPG), a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in owning, managing, and developing shopping malls and retail properties across the United States.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

SPG's cumulative return is 66.38%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's cumulative return of 117.62%.  The difference is -51.2%, placing it in the 44.6th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -103.6% and a maximum of 13.9%).  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided Alpha consistently shows negative values (-0.1), further highlighting underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The Beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $174.41
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $173.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $175.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $174.89

The current price is slightly below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential downward pressure.  The proximity to the moving averages indicates a relatively stable price environment in the recent past.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 41.29 (Below 50, indicating bearish sentiment)
* **PPO:** -0.0249 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +2.2% (Short-term upward trend)

The RSI and PPO indicators suggest bearish sentiment and momentum. However, the positive relative strength change indicates a recent short-term upward trend. The expected return of -68.4% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is exceptionally negative, strongly suggesting significant underperformance is anticipated.  This dramatically negative projection needs to be carefully considered. The 174.41 price doesn't indicate any extreme recent price swings (no evidence of a sudden, sharp spike or drop).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate 2024-10-25 entry).  Disregarding the duplicate, the trend shows:

* **Revenue:** Generally increasing, although there's a slight dip in the most recent quarter.
* **EPS:** Fluctuates, but generally shows some strength.  There's a dip from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024.

Without expectations data, we cannot assess whether these results beat or missed expectations.  The provided data alone does not provide a clear trend or significant insights into performance.  More complete data is necessary for a proper analysis.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, with minor fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high, above 80%, showing strong profitability.  Slight downward pressure on profit margin is visible in recent quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has fluctuated slightly. ROE shows variability, with a substantial drop in Q2 2024.  Generally, strong ROE is present but lacks consistency.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions were provided.  Market outlook and other relevant news are required for comprehensive analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period, indicated by a negative alpha and a substantially lower cumulative return. Technical indicators point to bearish sentiment. While recent earnings show relatively stable revenue and high profit margins, the EPS trend displays inconsistencies and lacks clarity.  The exceptionally negative projected long-term return raises serious concerns.  Further information, including analyst opinions, market outlook, and complete earnings data (with expectations) is crucial for a complete evaluation of SPG's investment potential.  The current data suggests caution.
