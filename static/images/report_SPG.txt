### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** \$178.23
*   **Previous Close:** \$178.92
*   **Change:** -\$0.39
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 181.31
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 182.84
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 175.09

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly down from the previous close. The price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term downward momentum. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a possible longer-term uptrend.

### 3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 45.46 (Neutral - not overbought or oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.60 (Bearish - below zero, suggesting a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Very Safe, MRI: 0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** -1.3 (Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** -191.7% (Significant negative expected return relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests that the overall market conditions are favorable for investment, but the negative PPO and recent negative change in relative deviation indicate some short-term bearish signals.
*   Despite the "Very Safe" hybrid signal, the extremely negative expected return is a major concern. This suggests that even with dollar-cost averaging, the model predicts significant underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term. The change of -\$0.39 is minimal, so the recent price fluctuation does not trigger a "sudden drop or increase" consideration.

### 7. Summary

SPG presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, reflected in the cumulative return and relative deviation.  Historical data shows negative alpha for many periods.  The most concerning is the extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Positives:** Analyst consensus is "Buy." Recent earnings and financial data show solid revenue, high profit margins, and healthy ROE.  The MRI indicates favorable market conditions.
*   **Neutral:** The stock price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but above the 60-day average, indicating mixed short-term and long-term trends.

**Overall Recommendation:** Due to the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 (VOO) and a highly negative expected return, caution is advised. Despite positive analyst ratings and recent earnings data, the fundamental model suggests a significant risk of underperformance. The upcoming earnings release and monitoring the progress of expansion plans are key to reassessing the outlook.
