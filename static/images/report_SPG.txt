SPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period.

A thorough evaluation requires further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and additional context regarding the market outlook and analyst sentiment.

Given the current data, a long-term investment in SPG requires cautious consideration. The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the negative long-term expected return are major concerns. Further research into the underlying causes of the underperformance, recent market trends affecting the retail sector and a thorough review of analyst forecasts are crucial before making any investment decision. The oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce; however, this should be considered alongside the other negative indicators.
