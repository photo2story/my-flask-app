**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, showing considerable volatility and consistently negative alpha. While recent earnings show some positive growth, the lack of complete financial data hinders a thorough assessment.

The significantly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 raises major concerns regarding long-term investment prospects.  Further investigation into the financial statements and broader market conditions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The absence of key financial data is a significant limitation to this analysis.
