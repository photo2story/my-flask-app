## Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focusing on owning, managing, and developing retail real estate properties.

The cumulative return of SPG is 64.76%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 116.43%.  Therefore, SPG underperformed VOO by **-51.7%** at the end of the period.  The relative underperformance, considering historical volatility, is at the 44.2nd percentile (meaning it's in the lower half of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500).

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently negative alpha, indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark. The beta is consistently high (around 0.65), suggesting higher volatility than the market, but less than a 1:1 correlation.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of strong growth, but also significant negative returns, particularly in 2018-2020.  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights periods of substantial losses.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $172.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $172.36
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $173.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $175.11

The price is currently slightly below its 20-day and significantly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a slight downward trend.  The 5-day average is even lower, indicating some recent downward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 48.41 - This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining near neutral territory.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.0144 - A slightly negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.4 -  Indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance against the S&P 500.

* **Expected Return:** -69.3% - This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and suggests significant underperformance is projected over the long term (2+ years).  This likely reflects the inherent risk in SPG's sector and its historical volatility.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue        |

Excluding the duplicate, earnings show relatively consistent revenue around $3.5B and EPS around $3.10 in the recent quarters, indicating stability.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPG has shown periods of strong performance, but it's currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500. The negative alpha, high beta, and a projected negative return relative to the S&P 500 are significant concerns. While the company boasts high profit margins and consistent revenue, the negative expected return and current downward price trend suggest caution.  The extremely negative projected return (-69.3%) warrants further investigation into the underlying assumptions of that projection.  Further due diligence, including a deeper analysis of the industry, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high projected drawdown also indicates significant risk.
