The earnings data shows relatively consistent EPS and revenue figures over the reported quarters, though a slight dip is observable in Q4 2023. Further analysis is needed to determine whether this represents a trend or simply a normal fluctuation.

| 2024-10-25 | 3.12 | $3.58B      |

**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profit margins remain relatively stable, indicating consistent profitability.  Equity fluctuates but remains strong.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG has shown inconsistent performance relative to the S&P 500, with recent positive alpha but a significant long-term underperformance.  While financial indicators like profit margins and ROE are generally strong, the relatively high beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  The negative expected return is a major concern.  Further investigation into the drivers of the recent large swings in CAGR and the potential reasons for the Q3 2024 dip in ROE is crucial.  Investors should carefully assess the risks associated with SPG's market sensitivity before making any investment decisions. The predicted long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500 needs to be carefully considered against the high profit margins and ROE. More in-depth analysis, including sector comparisons and a deeper dive into future industry forecasts, is highly recommended before making an informed investment decision.
