| 2015-2017  | -7.0% | 6.2% | -36.0% | -0.1 | 44.1 |

| 2017-2019  | -4.0% | 8.0% | -34.0% | -0.9 | 42.2 |
| 2018-2020  | -26.0% | 54.5% | -53.0% | -0.2 | 25.9 |
| 2019-2021  | 24.0% | 54.5% | -47.0% | -0.2 | 50.7 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $184.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $180.83
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $175.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $176.41

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's only slightly above its 60-day moving average, indicating the longer-term trend might be less bullish.  The recent price change of $2.12 shows a positive short-term movement.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.74 (approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.58 (positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.9% (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -55.9% (This suggests a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, based on current projections).

The high RSI value suggests the stock may be overbought and potentially due for a correction.  However, the positive PPO and recent relative divergence indicate ongoing upward momentum in the short term.  The significantly negative expected return is a major concern, suggesting a long-term investment in SPG is unlikely to outperform the S&P 500.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 3.12 | $3.58 Billion |
| 2024-07-30 | 3.23 | $3.55 Billion |
| 2024-04-25 | 3.16 | $3.49 Billion |
| 2023-11-02 | 2.34 | $3.08 Billion |
| 2024-10-25 | 2.34 | $3.08 Billion | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Earnings have been relatively consistent, with slight fluctuations.  The apparent duplicate entry for October 25th, 2024, needs clarification.  More analysis is needed to determine trends and future projections based on this data.

Revenue and profit margins are relatively stable and high.  ROE shows some fluctuation but generally remains strong, indicating good profitability relative to equity.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

SPG exhibits mixed signals. While recent short-term price action is positive and earnings are consistent,  the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 over the longer term, and a projected negative long-term expected return, are major concerns.  The high RSI suggests potential overvaluation.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and a deeper analysis of the -55.9% expected return projection are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The relatively strong financial metrics are a positive, but the market performance needs to be considered carefully.  A thorough assessment of the underlying business model and future market prospects is recommended.
