The table shows inconsistent performance with negative alpha values in several periods, suggesting underperformance relative to the market benchmark. The Beta fluctuates significantly, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $146.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $160.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $163.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $172.29

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The significant gap between the closing price and the moving averages suggests a potential for further downward pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (27.62):**  Suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity, but this must be considered within the context of the overall market trend and financial health of the company.
* **PPO (-0.70):**  Points to bearish momentum, consistent with the price action.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+2.1):** Shows short-term upward momentum.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI) (0.4693):** Classifies the market risk as High.
* **Expected Return (-76.8%):**  This extremely negative projected return compared to the S&P 500 is a major red flag, suggesting significant downside risk.  The reason for such a low projected return needs further investigation.  It is highly unlikely this is accurate.

The recent price drop of -$4.65 reflects negative market sentiment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG's current performance is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500. While the financial statements indicate a healthy company with high profit margins, the negative expected return, the recent price drop, and negative technical indicators paint a bearish picture. The extremely negative long-term expected return needs to be thoroughly investigated as it seems unrealistic. The inconsistencies in the provided Alpha values also warrant further investigation.  Before considering any investment, a more in-depth analysis of the underlying reasons for the underperformance and a careful review of the provided data (particularly the discrepancies noted above) is essential.  Currently, the risk appears high.
