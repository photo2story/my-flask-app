## Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) is a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in shopping malls and retail properties.  This report analyzes SPG's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and assessing its financial health and future prospects.  Key findings indicate significant underperformance relative to the market, though recent earnings suggest potential for recovery.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

SPG's cumulative return of 18.31% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's 71.02% return. This represents a substantial underperformance of -52.7 percentage points.  Considering the historical range of divergence (max: 12.4%, min: -110.5%), the current relative divergence of 47% indicates SPG is performing at the lower end of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) data show fluctuating performance over the years.  Alpha values consistently negative suggest underperformance compared to the market benchmark, and the high Beta values (above 40 consistently) indicate high market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $146.05
* **Previous Close:** $153.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $160.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $163.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $172.29

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent drop of $4.65 (-3.03%) indicates a potential short-term bearish sentiment.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 27.62 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.70 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.1 (Short-term upward trend, but within a broader downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -76.8% (This represents a significant negative expected return over the long term relative to the market, according to provided data.  Further analysis and context for this calculation is needed.)

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and high MRI indicates a bearish sentiment and potential for further downside. However, the recent slight upturn in relative divergence suggests some short-term resilience. The extremely negative expected return necessitates caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, showing consistent underperformance based on Alpha and high market sensitivity (Beta).  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, although recent slight improvements in relative divergence offer a glimmer of hope.  While the consistently high profit margins are positive,  the extremely negative long-term expected return from the provided data is a major concern.  Further investigation into the source and methodology behind the -76.8% expected return calculation is necessary.  A deeper dive into the earnings data, particularly addressing the duplicate entry, and a longer time series of data for all metrics would enable a more robust and comprehensive analysis.  Currently, caution is advised.  Before considering investment, further due diligence is strongly recommended.
