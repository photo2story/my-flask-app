*   Profit margins are very strong.
*   Recent news highlights international expansion and strategic initiatives.
*   **Contradictory Indicators:** The Hybrid Signal and the provided MRI value give opposing signals.
*   **Major Concern:** The extremely negative "Expected Return" is a significant red flag, although the methodology behind this calculation is unknown.

**Conclusion:**

SPG presents a mixed picture. While analyst ratings, recent earnings, and short-term price action are encouraging, the historical underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the concerning "Expected Return" warrant caution. The company's strategic initiatives, particularly international expansion, could be catalysts for future growth, but the risks need to be carefully considered. The conflicting signals from the MRI and Hybrid Signal should also be investigated further. The High MDD is also a big concern.
