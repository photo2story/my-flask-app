2026-01-01 - Analysis Report
Here's a breakdown of the SPG analysis, as requested:

**Company Overview:** Simon Property Group Inc. is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in shopping malls, Premium Outlets, and The Mills.

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Analysis:**

*   **SPG Cumulative Return:** 17.83%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -84.4 (Relative Divergence: 24.1)

*   **Analysis:** SPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period examined.  The divergence of -84.4 indicates substantial underperformance. The relative divergence of 24.1 suggests that the current divergence is closer to the minimum divergence observed in the historical data.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | 20.0% | 77.6% | -85.0% | -0.0 | 70.1   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 20.0% projected growth, potentially appealing.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 77.6% - A very high risk. This indicates a potentially substantial drop from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** -85.0% - Significantly underperforming its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** -0.0 - Almost no correlation with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** 70.1 Billion - Large market capitalization.

**Overall Analysis:** While the projected CAGR is positive, the extremely high MDD and negative Alpha raise serious concerns. The low beta is also not a good indicator because SPG is not behaving like the market and investors won't get the benefits of market tailwinds.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 185.95
*   **Previous Close:** 186.83
*   **Change:** -0.47
*   **5-day SMA:** 187.61
*   **20-day SMA:** 184.19
*   **60-day SMA:** 181.36

*   **Analysis:** The stock price experienced a slight decrease from the previous close. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend. However, the 20-day SMA is above the 60-day SMA, which could be a signal that the trend might not last as a medium-term trend is still up.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI:** 73.57 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.18 (Potentially bullish, but needs confirmation)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-19)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -203.8 (Very negative expected return compared to S&P 500.)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   The RSI approaching overbought territory indicates the stock could be due for a pullback.
    *   The negative relative divergence change in the last 20 days signals recent price weakness.
    *   The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Virginia Retirement Systems ET Al increased their SPG shareholdings.
    *   Simon Property is outperforming the real estate sector.

*   **Negative:**
    *   Fort Washington Investment Advisors Inc. OH decreased their SPG stock position.
    *   Comparison of Simon Property to Realty Income suggests Realty Income is better.
*   **Neutral/Technical:**
    *   "Trading the Move, Not the Narrative" - Focuses on technical trading around SPG.

*   **Analysis:** The news is mixed. While increased investment by a retirement system and outperformance of the real estate sector are positive, the decreased position by another firm and comparison to a competing REIT are less favorable.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.29)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 194.05 / 225.00 / 175.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes available in the provided data.

*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Buy" with a target price range suggesting potential upside from the current price. However, without knowing the recent rating changes, it's difficult to gauge the current sentiment of analysts.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

SPG shows mixed signals. While earnings and revenue are growing and profit margins are excellent, SPG has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500 and the negative alpha and high MDD are very serious. While the analyst recommendations are a buy, the technical indicators are signaling a potential downturn. The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term is a major concern. The recent news is mixed, with some positive developments offset by negative ones. In conclusion, the negative indicators outweigh the positive ones, suggesting caution when considering an investment in SPG.
