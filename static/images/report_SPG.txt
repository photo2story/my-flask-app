*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR has been highly variable.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** SPG has experienced significant MDDs, indicating substantial price declines from peak to trough in various periods.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently negative, meaning SPG has underperformed relative to its benchmark (market).  Positive alpha in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 shows periods where SPG outperformed the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally negative, suggesting SPG's price movements are inversely correlated with the market (S&P 500). This is unusual, as REITs often have betas close to 1.0. Negative beta signifies that the stock price declines while the index rises and vice versa.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** The capitalization fluctuates over time, reflecting changes in the company's market value.

**Analysis:**  SPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term. It has been a high volatility stock, and the negative Beta values suggest that SPG has moved in the opposite direction of the S&P500.
