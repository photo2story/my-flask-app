3. **Technical Indicators:** The RSI of 81.46 indicates the stock is currently in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a correction. The PPO of 0.41 suggests a bullish momentum, but with the RSI being overbought, it is important to monitor for potential reversals. The recent (20-day) relative divergence of 1.12 indicates a short-term upward trend, with a positive expected return of 2.68%.

**Overall Analysis:** 

SPG has underperformed the S&P 500 in the past, but recent price action suggests a potential upward trend. However, technical indicators like the RSI suggest overbought conditions, which could lead to a correction. While the recent earnings beat analyst expectations, it is important to monitor future earnings reports and market conditions to assess the long-term viability of SPG. Investors should consider these factors alongside their individual risk tolerance and investment goals before making any investment decisions.
