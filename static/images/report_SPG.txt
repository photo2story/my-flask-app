## Simon Property Group Inc (SPG) Stock Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

Simon Property Group Inc (SPG) is a leading real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in shopping malls and retail properties.  Recent performance shows underperformance relative to the S&P 500, but positive growth trends are evident in some key metrics.  Further analysis is required to determine the long-term investment prospects.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SPG's cumulative return (51.90%) lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return (85.44%) resulting in a significant negative divergence (-33.5%).  This places SPG in the 57.8th percentile of its historical range of divergence relative to the S&P 500, indicating it has underperformed the market in the recent period.

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance. While recent years (2021-2025) show strong positive alpha (indicating outperformance relative to the market), earlier periods experienced negative alpha, reflecting the overall underperformance against the S&P 500. Beta values vary, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements over time, with the latest years showing high betas (above 2), signifying higher risk and potential for significant gains or losses.  Market capitalization also shows some fluctuation, potentially indicating shifts in investor sentiment or corporate actions.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

SPG's closing price is $153.18.  This represents a significant drop from the previous close ($170.41), indicating a recent decline. Moving averages suggest a bearish trend: the price is below the 5-day ($164.08), 20-day ($164.70), and 60-day ($172.73) moving averages.  This confirms the recent price decline is a continuation of a larger downward trend. The significant price drop (-10.11) from the previous close warrants further investigation into potential underlying market events or company-specific news.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):**  0.432 suggests a medium-risk level.
* **RSI (41.08):** Below 50, indicating bearish momentum.
* **PPO (-0.09):** Negative value suggests a bearish trend.
* **Relative Divergence:** -6.8% over 20 days shows recent price weakening.
* **Expected Return:** -25.7%. This significant negative expected return reflects the recent price decline and underperformance relative to the S&P 500. The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not provided, requiring additional modeling or analysis to be obtained.  However, given the significant negative expected return and the current market trend, investment should be approached cautiously.
