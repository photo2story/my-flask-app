**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. While recent earnings and financial data indicate strong profitability, the negative alpha and high beta suggest higher risk and volatility.  The relatively low RSI and slightly positive PPO indicate neutral to slightly positive short-term momentum, but this needs to be viewed in light of the longer-term underperformance.  The negative expected return (-74.9%) highlights a significant risk associated with long-term investment in SPG relative to the S&P 500. Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and the accuracy of the provided data, especially the duplicate earnings entry, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests that SPG may not be a suitable investment for risk-averse investors seeking market-beating returns.
