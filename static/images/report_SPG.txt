Over the observed period, SPG's cumulative return (67.86%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which achieved a cumulative return of 120.36%.  The difference is -52.5%, placing it in the 43.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max range).

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $175.20

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term upward trend. However, it's slightly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting some potential resistance at this level.
