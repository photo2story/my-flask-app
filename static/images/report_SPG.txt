**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly. While financial statements indicate strong profitability and relatively stable revenue, the stock price shows bearish momentum supported by technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages).  The negative expected return (-94.6%) needs clarification.  The inconsistent alpha and high beta suggest a high-risk, high-reward investment with substantial market sensitivity. Further investigation is needed to understand the discrepancies between financial performance and stock price movement.  Consider reviewing macroeconomic factors affecting the retail sector,  SPG's specific business strategies, and a more comprehensive risk assessment before making any investment decisions.  The provided -94.6% expected return is highly unlikely and should be disregarded unless further information is provided to explain this outlier.
