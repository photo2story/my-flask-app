The beta fluctuates between 25.8 and 65.2, indicating high market sensitivity.  Higher beta values (e.g., 64.7 in 2022-2024) suggest that SPG's price tends to be more volatile than the market.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPG shows consistently high profit margins and profitability, suggesting a strong business model. However, its significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (-54.3%), consistently negative alpha, and projected long-term underperformance (-75.2% relative to S&P 500) raise serious concerns.  The high beta indicates considerable market sensitivity and volatility.  While the recent price movement isn't drastically alarming, the overall picture paints a less-than-favorable outlook for long-term investment.  Further investigation into the reasons behind SPG's underperformance relative to the market is warranted before any investment decision is made.  Careful consideration of the significant risks involved is crucial.
