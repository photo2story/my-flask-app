*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 179.818
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 180.399

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly below its 5-day moving average but above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a possible short-term downtrend within a medium-term uptrend. The slight decrease in the last market session indicates a minor pullback.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 55.81 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is neutral.

However, the significantly negative expected return raises concerns about long-term investment potential. The hybrid signal suggesting buying all available cash is contradictory given the other negative data. This signal might be based on different criteria not fully explained in the data provided.
