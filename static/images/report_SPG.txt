Simon Property Group (SPG) presents a mixed picture.

However, its historical underperformance, high volatility, negative Beta, and concerning expected return figures indicate a higher-risk investment.

The negative Beta and extremely negative expected return suggest significant risks and potential long-term underperformance compared to the broader market.
