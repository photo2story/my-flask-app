| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                     |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2015-2017  | -7.0% | 6.2% | -0.36 | -0.1 | 44.1 | Negative Alpha, high Beta (market sensitive) |
| 2016-2018  | 1.0% | 8.0% | -0.17 | -0.0 | 45.3 | Low Growth, Low Beta                         |
| 2017-2019  | -4.0% | 8.0% | -0.34 | -0.9 | 42.2 | Negative Alpha, high Beta (market sensitive) |
| 2018-2020  | -26.0% | 54.5% | -0.53 | -0.2 | 25.9 | Significant underperformance, high MDD       |
| 2019-2021  | 24.0% | 54.5% | -0.47 | -0.2 | 50.7 | Positive growth but still negative alpha     |
| 2020-2022  | 20.0% | 54.5% | 0.11  | -0.1 | 39.6 | Positive return, relatively low Beta        |
| 2021-2023  | 59.0% | 14.9% | 0.36  | 0.6  | 51.2 | Strong positive growth, positive alpha      |
| 2022-2024  | 42.0% | 14.9% | 0.09  | 0.5  | 64.9 | Positive growth, positive alpha             |
| 2023-2025  | 62.0% | 9.6%  | -0.01 | 1.7  | 69.8 | Strong growth but high beta, slightly negative alpha |

The Beta values suggest significant market sensitivity.  The positive Alpha values in recent years indicate periods of outperformance.  However, the overall picture is one of fluctuating performance relative to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $185.05
* **Previous Close:** $186.22
* **5-day Moving Average:** $184.02
* **20-day Moving Average:** $177.69
* **60-day Moving Average:** $176.80

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, indicating recent minor downward pressure. However, it sits comfortably above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting an overall uptrend.  The recent price change reflects a small decrease (-0.63).


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.02 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term pullback.)
* **PPO:** 0.63 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 1.3 (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -57.7% (This signifies that, based on the provided data,  long-term investment in SPG is expected to underperform VOO by 57.7% over two or more years. This is a significant underperformance.)

The price decrease of -0.63 is not significant enough to suggest a rapid decline.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

SPG shows strong financial fundamentals with high profit margins and ROE. However, its stock price performance has significantly lagged behind the S&P 500, especially in the long term, as indicated by the -57.7% expected return relative to VOO over a 2+ year timeframe. While recent periods show improved performance and positive alpha, the historical data demonstrates a high degree of market sensitivity (high Beta) and periods of considerable underperformance. The current technical indicators (RSI nearing overbought territory) suggest a potential short-term correction. Therefore, a cautious approach is advised.  Investors should carefully consider the long-term underperformance relative to the broader market before making any investment decisions. Further investigation into the reasons for the persistent underperformance is warranted.  The data provided does not provide enough detail on the market and macro factors that impacted the SPG performance over the analysis period.
