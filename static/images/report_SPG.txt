**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, a trend reflected in its price movement below key moving averages and negative PPO.  While RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the negative expected return and generally bearish indicators cast doubt on a significant near-term rebound.  The company's high profit margins and strong ROE showcase underlying financial strength.  However, the large negative alpha suggests persistent underperformance relative to market expectations.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy should consider the risks and uncertainties, particularly concerning the -81.9% expected return which requires further investigation and explanation.  Further due diligence is needed to assess the validity of the highly negative expected return projection before making any investment decisions.  Analyzing the data in conjunction with broader market trends and a thorough understanding of the real estate sector and SPG's specific business model is crucial.
