**1) Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

The high beta values suggest SPG's returns are highly sensitive to market movements.  The fluctuating alpha indicates periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  The recent positive alpha values are encouraging.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $183.80
* **Previous Close:** $186.71
* **Change:** -$2.91 (1.56% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $185.51
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $179.92
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $177.23

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.  The recent drop of 1.56% warrants attention.



**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.89 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 0.30 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -53.7% (This suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, based on current data.  This should be considered with caution, as long-term predictions are uncertain.)

The recent price drop (-1.56%) needs to be considered in conjunction with the relatively high RSI.  While the PPO indicates bullish momentum, the RSI suggests potential overbought conditions.  The negative long-term expected return needs to be carefully examined â€“ it strongly suggests the need for a more in-depth investigation into the fundamentals.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 3.12  | $3.58 B       |
| 2024-07-30 | 3.23  | $3.55 B       |
| 2024-04-25 | 3.16  | $3.49 B       |

| 2024-10-25 | 2.34  | $3.08 B       |

There's a duplicated entry for October 25th, 2024.  Assuming this is an error, the data shows relatively stable revenue with some fluctuation in EPS.  A more detailed analysis would be necessary to assess the health of the business.

The financial data shows strong and relatively consistent profit margins and ROE, although there is some fluctuation.  The relatively high profit margins are typical for REITs.  Further analysis is required to understand the causes of the variations in ROE and revenue.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

SPG's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly over the analyzed period. While the company demonstrates strong financial metrics, the substantial underperformance relative to the market, as indicated by both cumulative returns and the long-term expected return, raises serious concerns.  The high beta suggests high market sensitivity, and the fluctuating alpha indicates inconsistent performance relative to the broader market.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction may be on the horizon.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough fundamental analysis is strongly recommended, including detailed examination of its earnings, financial health, and future growth prospects in light of the current retail landscape.  The significant long-term negative expected return (-53.7%) should be a key consideration in any investment strategy.
