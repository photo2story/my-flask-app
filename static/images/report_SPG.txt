## Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

SPG's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While SPG showed a 10.76% return, VOO achieved a 66.94% return, resulting in a considerable negative divergence.  The provided data indicates a recent price surge, however,  long-term performance relative to the market is weak.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in shopping malls and retail properties.

* **SPG Cumulative Return:** 10.76%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 66.94%
* **Return Difference:** -56.2%
* **Relative Divergence:** 44.3% (This indicates that SPG's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is in the lower 44.3% percentile of its historical range of underperformance).

The alpha and beta analysis reveals significant volatility and underperformance against the market (negative alpha in most periods)  with a high beta (above 40 in most periods) suggesting high sensitivity to market movements.  The recent positive CAGR values in the 2022-2025 period are promising, but need to be analyzed in the context of previous poor performances.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $153.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $147.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $160.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $171.04

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend, though the recent price increase is a significant factor that could shift the trend upward. The 9.13% increase in the "Last-market" data indicates a substantial recent price jump.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.53 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.99 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -1.08 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.5% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -81.7% (This extremely negative expected return needs careful consideration and context.  It suggests a high degree of risk.)
* **Price Change:** The 9.13% price increase ("Last-market") indicates a sharp recent upturn, potentially indicating a temporary reversal of the downward trend, rather than a sustained change in trajectory.

The negative expected return and negative PPO, coupled with the high Market Risk Indicator, suggest caution.  The recent price jump adds complexity and requires further investigation into the reasons for this increase.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 3.12  | $3.58B        |
| 2024-07-30 | 3.23  | $3.55B        |
| 2024-04-25 | 3.16  | $3.49B        |
| 2023-11-02 | 2.34  | $3.08B        |
| 2024-10-25 | 2.34  | $3.08B        |


There appears to be a data duplication error in the table (2024-10-25 appearing twice).  Excluding the duplicate entry, the data shows relatively stable EPS and revenue, though there's a slight dip in Q4 2023.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this level of earnings.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.58B | 82.82%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.48B | 82.57%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.46B | 84.37%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.44B | 81.90%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $1.53B | 83.27%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE      |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.94B | 22.71%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $2.71B | 17.54%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.94B | 16.79%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.11B | 23.58%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.02B | 24.76%   |

Both revenue and profitability show consistent and strong figures, though there's slight quarterly variation. ROE also shows good profitability, although there's some fluctuation from quarter to quarter. This positive financial picture contrasts sharply with the negative performance relative to the market.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG's financial statements reveal a healthy and stable company with consistent revenue and high profit margins.  However, the stock's performance significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, resulting in a substantial negative alpha. While the recent price surge might suggest a turnaround, the negative expected return, high market risk indicator, and below-average moving averages warrant caution. The considerable discrepancy between the company's fundamental strength and its relative market performance demands further investigation into underlying factors impacting investor sentiment and the reasons for the recent price jump.  A deeper dive into sector-specific news and potential catalysts is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The -81.7% expected return is especially concerning and likely reflects the inherent risks associated with the stockâ€™s current trajectory and market positioning.
