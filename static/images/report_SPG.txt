## Simon Property Group Inc (SPG) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

SPG's cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period.  While showing recent positive momentum, its overall performance demonstrates underperformance compared to the broader market.  This report will delve into a detailed analysis of its financial health and market positioning to determine potential investment implications.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Simon Property Group Inc (SPG) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in shopping malls and retail properties.

* **Cumulative Return:** SPG: 33.65%, VOO: 76.31%
* **Return Difference:** SPG underperformed VOO by 42.7 percentage points.  Its relative underperformance, considering historical volatility, is at the 54.9th percentile.  This suggests the current underperformance is not unusually extreme relative to its historical track record.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 7.0% | 65.0% | -25.0% | -0.0 | 43.5 |
| 2016-2018  | 11.0% | 57.9% | -10.0% | -0.1 | 44.6 |
| 2017-2019  | 3.0% | 57.9% | 0.5 | 41.6 |
| 2018-2020  | -39.0% | 58.6% | -0.1 | 25.5 |
| 2019-2021  | -1.0% | 58.8% | -0.1 | 50.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -1.0% | 72.9% | -0.8 | 39.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 66.0% | 72.9% | -2.1 | 50.4 |
| 2022-2024  | 44.0% | 72.9% | -1.9 | 64.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 35.0% | 81.6% | -0.1 | 56.7 |

**Alpha Analysis:**  The consistently negative alpha values across several periods indicate that SPG has historically underperformed the market benchmark, adjusted for its beta (volatility). The recent positive CAGR is noteworthy, but the consistently negative alpha suggests it may be due to broader market trends rather than company-specific outperformance.

**Beta Analysis:**  The beta values fluctuate around 1, indicating that SPG's price movements generally correlate with market fluctuations. However, the market cap has varied significantly, which can influence beta.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $150.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $149.15
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $154.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $168.01

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price increase (Last-market data shows a $2.38 increase from the previous close) is relatively small compared to the distance from the moving averages, implying this upward movement might not signal a significant trend reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.94 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** 0.18 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum but weak)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** 2.3 (Positive, short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -52.3% (This is a significant negative expected return.  It suggests that current valuations do not fully reflect future growth prospects. Clarification is needed on how this negative expected return is calculated â€“ considering the long-term nature of the investment (2+ years), this would need to be compared to a similar long-term projected return for the S&P 500 to determine any significant alpha.)

The 2.38 price increase, while positive, needs to be considered within the context of its long-term underperformance. It doesn't qualify as a significant "sudden" upward or downward movement based on the context provided.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 3.12 | $3.58B        |
| 2024-07-30 | 3.23 | $3.55B        |
| 2024-04-25 | 3.16 | $3.49B        |
| 2023-11-02 | 2.34 | $3.08B        |
| 2024-10-25 | 2.34 | $3.08B        | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*


There's a possible data duplication.  EPS and revenue appear relatively stable, but further analysis is needed to determine trends and growth.  The data needs correction to properly assess the earnings trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SPG's long-term performance has lagged the S&P 500, with consistently negative alpha.  While recent earnings and financial information show healthy profit margins and strong revenue, the stock's price action suggests a bearish short-term trend. The provided -52.3% expected return warrants further investigation to understand the methodology.  Before investing, further due diligence is crucial,  including a thorough examination of the company's long-term growth prospects and a comparison of the provided -52.3% expected return against a benchmark (like a projected S&P 500 return over the same period).  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) also require clarification.  A more complete analysis should incorporate valuation metrics and a comprehensive review of the industry landscape.
