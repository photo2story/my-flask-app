**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPG demonstrates strong financial fundamentals with high profit margins and ROE. However, its stock price performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The negative long-term expected return compared to the market is a major concern. While technical indicators are not overly bearish, the consistent underperformance and negative alpha warrant further investigation into the underlying reasons for this discrepancy. Before investing, a thorough examination of the company's future growth prospects and a comparison to other REITs is recommended.  The data inconsistencies require clarification before drawing definitive conclusions.
