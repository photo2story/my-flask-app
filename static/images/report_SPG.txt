## Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Relative Strength:**

Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership and operation of shopping malls and retail properties.

SPG's cumulative return (64.03%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.56%.  The difference is -53.5%, placing it at the 42.5th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-103.4% to +13.9%). This indicates SPG has lagged behind the market considerably over the period considered.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $171.38
* **Last Market Price:** $173.35
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $172.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $178.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $174.01

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. The last market price of $173.35 indicates a slight upward movement from the closing price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (37.85):**  Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a short-term bounce.
* **PPO (-0.78):** Negative PPO value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-5.1%):** Shows a recent weakening in relative strength against the market.

The expected return is 0.0%. This suggests that, while a short-term bounce is possible given the RSI, long-term (2+ years) returns are expected to be in line with the market, not exceeding the S&P 500.  A significant jump to $173.35 would suggest a short-term price recovery.  However, given the negative PPO and the moving averages, this may be a temporary bounce.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |

| 2024-07-30 | 3.23   | $3.55 B       |

**Analysis:**  There's a discrepancy in the October 25th data.  Ignoring the duplicate, EPS shows some fluctuation but generally remains relatively stable.

Without further information (like expectations),  it is impossible to determine whether reported numbers are "beats" or "misses."

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, hovering around $1.4-$1.5B per quarter. Profit margins are consistently high (80-84%), indicating strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows some fluctuation, and ROE is volatile, ranging from 16.79% to 24.76%.  This highlights potential instability in the profitability metrics.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SPG has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the analyzed period. While recent earnings show consistent revenue and high profit margins, the stock's price is currently trading below its moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend. Technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest potential for a short-term bounce, but long-term outlook remains uncertain with 0% expected return relative to S&P500.  More information is needed on recent news and analyst sentiment to provide a more comprehensive assessment.  The volatility in ROE and the incomplete earnings data present some concerns.
