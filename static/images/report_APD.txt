**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD) is a leading industrial gases company providing atmospheric, process, and specialty gases, as well as related equipment and services.

Over the review period, APD significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 39.10% compared to VOO's 82.57%.  The difference of -43.5% highlights this underperformance.  While this is a substantial gap, the relative divergence of 20.3% suggests this isn't the worst relative performance APD has ever shown historically.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance across different periods.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) was strong in several periods (reaching 67% in 2019-2021), recent years (2021-2025) show significant negative returns.  The Beta, consistently around 0.8-1.0, suggests APD's price movements are somewhat sensitive to overall market fluctuations.  Alpha values, generally positive in past periods, also become positive in recent periods, signifying some outperformance in recent years, though not enough to overcome the negative returns.  The substantial change in MDD (Maximum Drawdown) in recent years is noteworthy and indicates increased risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $268.85
* **5-day Moving Average:** $263.89
* **20-day Moving Average:** $271.98
* **60-day Moving Average:** $296.34

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short-to-medium term.  The recent price increase of $1.55 shows some price recovery, but it's important to note that this is a relatively small move in the context of the longer-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.20 (Slightly below neutral; suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, but leaning towards oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.30 (Positive, suggesting potential bullish momentum, but weak)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -4.5% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -30.9% (Indicates a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term)

The relatively low RSI and the negative relative divergence change (indicating a shorter-term downtrend), combined with the negative expected return, paint a cautious outlook. The recent price increase from the previous close is not significant enough to change this outlook. The medium market risk also supports a conservative approach.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2025-02-06 | $2.77 | $2.93 Billion |
| 2024-08-01 | $3.13 | $2.99 Billion |

| 2024-02-05 | $2.74 | $3.00 Billion |
| 2025-02-06 | $2.74 | $3.00 Billion |


Earnings show some fluctuation, with no clear upward or downward trend. Revenue remains relatively stable around $2.9â€“3.0 Billion, while EPS is inconsistent.  More data is needed for a conclusive analysis.  The apparent duplication of the 2025-02-06 entry needs clarification.

| 2023-12-31  | $14.87B     | 4.10%         |

Revenue shows some volatility, but generally stays consistent. Profit margins are healthy and relatively stable.  Equity shows fluctuations, but ROE (Return on Equity) is variable, suggesting potential challenges in consistently generating returns on invested capital. The high ROE in Q3 2024 is noteworthy and requires further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

APD has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent periods, as reflected in the substantial negative return difference. While some technical indicators hint at potential bullish momentum, the negative expected return and the recent downtrend suggest caution.  Earnings and financial data show some volatility but generally healthy profit margins.  The inconsistent ROE highlights a potential area of concern regarding the company's ability to consistently generate returns on equity.  Further investigation into the causes of the recent underperformance and the outlier ROE in Q3 2024 is necessary before making investment decisions.  The data suggests a cautious approach;  the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant consideration.
