**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Air Products and Chemicals Inc. is an industrial gases company providing gases and related equipment to various industries.
*   **Performance:** APD has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return divergence of -110.1. Its relative divergence of 3.4 indicates that its current underperformance is near the lowest end of its historical range.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**
    *   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are mixed. The stock generated positive Alpha for periods between 2016 and 2022. However, it has displayed negative Alpha for periods including 2015-2017, 2018-2021 and most recently, 2021-2025. This means that it performs worse than market predictions based on Beta. The Alpha got rapidly worse since 2021.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta has generally been positive (between 0.1 and 0.9), which indicates the stock’s price generally moves in the same direction as the market.
    *   **CAGR:** CAGR rapidly went down since 2021.
    *   **MDD:** MDD has remained very high (between 64.6% to 79.4%).
    *   **Capital:** Market Cap is decreasing recently.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Trend:** The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day simple moving averages, indicating a recent downward trend. The moving average figures are consecutively rising, implying a continued downward trend in stock price.

**3) RSI, PPO Analysis & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** An MRI of 0.7 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation based on this indicator alone.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 36.03 suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory, which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity. However, given the other negative indicators, it might simply indicate a sustained downtrend.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of -0.21 suggests a downward trend.
*   **Recent relative divergence change :** Recent divergence change increased to 3.4 (implying a short-term increase).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends investing 100% of cash (4 shares) which it indicates is "Very Safe". It recommends investing $1,000 per month and predicts a cash ratio of 0% on 2025-12-01.
*   **Expected Return:** The overwhelmingly negative expected return of -907.3% is a huge red flag, indicating very poor future performance relative to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** The recent news headlines overwhelmingly point to negative sentiment:
    *   Price target cuts from analysts (Mizuho).
    *   Significant stock drop (Forbes, Quiver Quantitative).
    *   52-week low after a deal (ts2.tech).
*   **Options Activity:** The options trading activity (Nasdaq) is just a neutral data point.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Mixed Signals:** While the analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy" rating (Mean of 2.04), the target price range (\$245.00 - \$340.00) shows significant disagreement, and the low target price is extremely close to the current trading price. The fact that the company is close to the minimum target price implies that the analyst ratings may be outdated or optimistic.
*   **Lack of Recent Changes:** No recent rating changes are listed, which suggests analysts may be waiting for more information before adjusting their ratings.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**
