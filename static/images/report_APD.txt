*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent decline in divergence suggests that the stock is trending downward in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** The dramatically negative expected return suggests that the model predicts substantial underperformance if the investment is held long-term from this point. This figure is highly concerning.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Meyer Handelman Co. Sold APD Shares:** A firm selling shares can sometimes indicate a lack of confidence in the stock's near-term potential.

**Analysis:**

The news flow is mixed. There are negative headlines related to recent price drops and a 52-week low, as well as news of a firm selling shares. However, there's also a positive report from Bernstein reiterating an "Outperform" rating. The Yara Hydrogen deal seems to have been initially perceived negatively by the market.
