While exhibiting strong historical performance, recent performance lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO), indicated by a negative cumulative return difference.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $277.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $300.38

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent small price increase of $0.6 from the previous close is not significant enough to counteract the overall bearish trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  While revenue is relatively stable around $2.9-3.0B, EPS has fluctuated.  Further analysis is needed to determine if this volatility is concerning or within normal operating ranges for the company.

|------------|------|-------------|

**6. Overall Analysis:**

APD's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500. While historical data shows periods of strong growth, the recent negative trend is a concern. Technical indicators suggest the stock might be oversold, but this should be considered in conjunction with fundamental analysis.  The provided financial data requires further investigation to fully understand the drivers of profitability and the recent underperformance.  The significant negative projected return (-22.8%) requires clarification on its calculation methodology.  A deeper dive into the company's business strategy, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is needed for a comprehensive evaluation.  Investors should conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.
