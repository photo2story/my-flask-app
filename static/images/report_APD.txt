However,  the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been quite variable, ranging from a high of 76% to a low of -16%, reflecting market conditions and the company's specific performance.

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. However, it's very close to the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance at this level.  The gap between the 20-day and the current price suggests recent upward momentum.

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 73.22 – This suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating a potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.40 – A positive PPO value shows upward momentum.

The expected return of -0.4% over a long-term (2+ years) horizon compared to the S&P 500 suggests underperformance.  However, this prediction needs to be considered carefully as it does not factor in potential future growth or economic changes.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue remains relatively stable around $3 billion, EPS exhibits variability.  There is an apparent duplication of data for August 1st, 2024. This needs clarification to conduct a proper analysis.  A more comprehensive analysis would require a longer time series and an understanding of the factors driving these fluctuations (e.g., seasonality, market demand, one-time events).

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-08-01 | 3.13 | $2.99B        |
| 2024-04-30 | 2.57 | $2.93B        |
| 2024-02-05 | 2.74 | $3.00B        |
| 2023-08-03 | 2.68 | $3.03B        |
| 2024-08-01 | 2.68 | $3.03B        | *(Duplicate Data)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows consistent revenue and profitability, though there is some quarter-to-quarter variation. Profit margins are healthy and generally trending upwards.  The equity has seen notable growth, and ROE (Return on Equity) has fluctuated, suggesting some variability in the efficiency of capital utilization.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers behind these fluctuations.

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity   | ROE     |
|-------------|----------|---------------|----------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | $3.19B  | 33.98%        | $17.04B | 11.45%  |
| 2024-06-30  | $2.99B  | 32.82%        | $15.10B | 4.61%   |
| 2024-03-31  | $2.93B  | 32.04%        | $14.91B | 3.84%   |
| 2023-12-31  | $3.00B  | 31.03%        | $14.87B | 4.10%   |
| 2023-09-30  | $3.19B  | 30.84%        | $14.31B | 4.84%   |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

APD shows a relatively stable revenue stream and healthy profit margins. However, its recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a short-term bullish trend but also caution of potential overbought conditions. The company’s relatively low beta indicates lower volatility than the broader market, which could be attractive to some investors.  However, the significant maximum drawdown highlights the inherent risk.  A deeper dive into the drivers of earnings fluctuations and a longer-term perspective are crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.  The provided expected return of -0.4% relative to the S&P 500 over the long term needs further investigation and validation.  The duplication in the earnings data requires clarification.
