Noteworthy is the significant negative CAGR and high MDD in the most recent periods (2021-2025), indicating underperformance and high volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $309.49
* **Previous Close:** $310.55
* **5-day Moving Average:** $318.35
* **20-day Moving Average:** $322.58
* **60-day Moving Average:** $313.10

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price change of -$0.34 also confirms this bearish sentiment in the short term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.20 (Slightly below neutral; Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, but leaning towards bearish)
* **PPO:** -0.85 (Negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -13.9% (Indicates a recent decrease in relative strength)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.7% (This suggests APD is expected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term by 3.7%, based on the given data, which should be viewed with significant caution.)


The negative PPO and declining relative divergence further support the short-term bearish outlook.  The small negative change in price (-$0.34) doesn't suggest a dramatic event.  The projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 needs further analysis and context, considering potential market shifts and external factors.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 2025-02-06 | 2.74 | $3.00B        |

There's inconsistency in the data; 2025-02-06 appears twice with different EPS.  Overall, revenue remains relatively stable around $2.9-3.0B, while EPS shows some fluctuation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

APD's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly over the observed period.

Inconsistencies in the earnings data and volatility in ROE require further investigation before forming definitive conclusions.  More comprehensive data, including industry comparisons and detailed financial statement analysis, is necessary for a more thorough and reliable assessment of APD's investment prospects.
