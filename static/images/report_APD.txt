## Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:**

Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD) is a leading industrial gases company.  This report analyzes APD's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), using provided financial data including CAGR, MDD, Alpha, Beta, recent price movements, technical indicators (RSI, PPO), and recent earnings and financial statements.  The analysis suggests APD's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, but certain metrics warrant further investigation.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Air Products and Chemicals Inc. is a leading industrial gases company providing atmospheric, process, and specialty gases.

* **Cumulative Return (APD):** 87.44%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 108.62%
* **Return Difference (APD vs. VOO):** -21.2%
* **Relative Divergence:** 30.9% (This indicates APD's underperformance relative to VOO is in the lower 30.9th percentile of historical divergence based on the provided min/max range.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows varied performance across different periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), recent years indicate underperformance relative to the market (beta > 1 and negative CAGR in 2021-2025).  The significant negative alpha in the most recent period (-12% vs -7% for S&P500) suggests the underperformance relative to the market is likely not random.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2017-2019  | 59.0% | 6.2% | 28.0% | 0.9 | 46.4 |
| 2018-2020  | 56.0% | 7.6% | 29.0% | 0.3 | 55.1 |

**2) Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $316.41
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $310.99
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $312.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $309.70

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's slightly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a less pronounced longer-term trend.  The recent price increase of $1.75 from the previous close suggests a minor positive movement.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.3  (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.099 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +5.8% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.5% (APD is expected to underperform the S&P 500 by 3.5% over the long term.)

The relatively small change in price from the previous close (1.75) is not indicative of a significant rapid movement (neither 급반등 nor 급하락).  The negative expected return highlights the concern of sustained underperformance relative to the market.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-02-06 | 2.77 | $2.93B      |

| 2025-02-06 | 2.74 | $3.00B      | *(Note: duplicate entry?)*


Earnings show some volatility, with EPS fluctuating between $2.57 and $3.13. Revenue remains relatively stable around $2.9-3.0 billion.  The duplicated entry needs clarification.

|---------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $16.69B  | 3.70%  |

Equity shows some fluctuation, and ROE varies significantly, with a particularly high value in Q3 2024. This warrants further investigation into the factors driving this variability.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

APD has shown mixed performance. While historical data indicates periods of strong growth and outperformance relative to the S&P 500, recent performance has lagged significantly.  The negative expected return, coupled with the negative PPO and the relatively high negative alpha in the recent period, are concerning.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons for the recent underperformance and whether it's temporary or indicative of a larger trend.  The significant fluctuation in ROE and the duplication in the earnings data also require further investigation before drawing definitive conclusions.  It's crucial to examine industry trends, competitive landscape, and any specific events impacting APD's performance to fully assess its investment prospects.
