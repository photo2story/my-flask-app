* **60-Day Moving Average:** $308.30

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small difference between the last market price and the closing price suggests minimal price volatility on the last day.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (85.17):**  The RSI is extremely high, indicating the stock is significantly overbought.  This suggests a potential short-term pullback is likely.
* **PPO (0.37):** A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, although the high RSI may mitigate this.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (NaN):** The missing data prevents a complete analysis of recent relative divergence.  However, a mentioned '단기하락' (short-term decline) suggests a recent shift in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) suggests that, at this time, APD may not offer significant outperformance compared to the broader market.  This is likely related to the already relatively high valuation implied by the high RSI.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals a somewhat inconsistent trend:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has fluctuated between $2.93B and $3.03B in recent quarters, with no clear upward or downward trend.
* **EPS:** EPS is similarly inconsistent, showing a slight decrease between Q1 and Q2 2024 before a small increase in Q3.  There's no consistent trend in EPS over the past year.

The lack of provided expectations prevents a determination of beats or misses.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has been relatively stable, but profit margins show a slight upward trend from 30.84% (Q3 2023) to 33.98% (Q3 2024).  This is a positive sign of improving profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has significantly increased, indicating a strong financial position. ROE is volatile, but shows recent improvement from a low in Q1 2024, potentially indicative of improving efficiency.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news within the past two days was provided, therefore an analysis cannot be done.  Similarly, no recent market outlook or analyst opinions were provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

APD shows a mixed performance. While recent financial results demonstrate improving profit margins and a strong financial position, the stock is currently overbought (high RSI), and its recent performance has lagged the S&P 500.  The expected return of 0% relative to the S&P 500 suggests that there may be limited alpha opportunities for long-term investors at the current valuation.  The lack of recent news and further contextual data (market outlook, analyst ratings) limits a fully comprehensive assessment.  Caution is advised given the high RSI and the need for further information.  Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and rewards before making investment decisions.  A downward correction could be expected given the overbought conditions.
