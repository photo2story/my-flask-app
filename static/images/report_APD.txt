This report analyzes Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD), a leading industrial gas company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Air Products' cumulative return (107.58%) lags behind the S&P 500's (128.86%) by 21.3 percentage points as of the last data point.  The relative divergence of -21.3% places it at the 31.3th percentile of its historical range (-60.3% to 64.2%), indicating underperformance relative to the S&P 500, although not drastically so compared to its historical performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Close:** $333.22 (Last Market: $333.11)
* **5-day MA:** $332.54
* **20-day MA:** $319.10
* **60-day MA:** $307.26

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day MA indicates recent stability.

**3. Technical Indicators and Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI:** 84.69 (Overbought territory)  A high RSI suggests the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction.
* **PPO:** 0.43 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** +4.6% (Short-term upward trend)

The high RSI is a cautionary signal, despite the positive PPO and recent relative divergence.  The slight difference between the closing price and the last market price ($333.22 vs $333.11) does not indicate any significant rapid price movements (no evidence of sharp upturns or downturns).  The expected return of 0.0% suggests no significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is projected at this time, although long-term (2+ years) compounding could see gains.
