*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Drawdowns are high across all periods, indicating substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally negative in recent years, suggesting underperformance relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark.  The large negative alpha in 2023-2025 is particularly concerning.

## 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Previous Close:** $294.52
*   **Price Change:** -$0.58
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 290.178
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 291.9675
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 289.9343

**Analysis:** The price is slightly down from the previous close. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day moving average, which is above the 60-day moving average, suggesting a short-term uptrend, but the small change may not indicate a strong trend.

## 3. Technical Indicators & Signals

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3233 (Medium Risk)
*   **RSI:** 36.12 (Approaching oversold territory)

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Performance Gap Change:** 0.2 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -1467.9% (Significant underperformance relative to S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon)

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates medium risk. The RSI is nearing oversold levels, which could suggest a potential buying opportunity for some investors, though it's essential to consider other factors. The PPO being negative indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average. The Hybrid Signal suggests a buy recommendation with most of the available cash, but with a safe risk profile. The recent increase in the relative performance gap change suggests a short-term improvement in APD's performance relative to VOO. The extremely negative expected return is a significant red flag.
