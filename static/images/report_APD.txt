* **Closing Price:** $324.0
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $318.12
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $298.39
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $309.49

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The recent price change of $2.21 (0.7%) reflects a minor positive shift.

The projected long-term return relative to the market is negative.

The presented data alone is insufficient to recommend a buy, sell, or hold decision.
