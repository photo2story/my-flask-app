    *   MRI indicates Medium Investment.
    *   The Hybrid Signal suggests a strong buy, but the high MRI makes it a risky move.
    *   The large negative expected return (-907.3%) is extremely concerning and indicates a significantly pessimistic outlook, meaning very poor returns are expected compared to the S&P 500.
    *   The recent relative divergence change indicates a short-term upward trend.

*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 292.86 / 340.00 / 245.00

*   **Negative Sentiment:**  Recent news and analyst downgrades point to a negative sentiment surrounding the stock.
