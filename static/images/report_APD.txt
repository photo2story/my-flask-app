**Analysis:** APD's stock price is currently below its 5-day moving average but above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages.

| 2025-02-06 | 2.77   | 2.93 B$    |

**Analysis:** Revenue has been relatively consistent over the past year. However, the profit margin has shown a slight decrease in the most recent quarter. The negative ROE in the most recent quarter is a major cause for concern, likely related to the negative EPS reported in the earnings analysis. Equity has also decreased, which is a negative signal.
