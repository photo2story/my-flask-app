## Air Products and Chemicals Inc (APD) Stock Review

This report analyzes Air Products and Chemicals Inc (APD), a leading industrial gases company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Air Products (APD) has exhibited a cumulative return of 89.75% over the period considered, compared to 118.37% for the S&P 500 (VOO).  This represents a difference of -28.6%, placing it at the 24.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. While APD has shown strong growth, it has underperformed the broader market index during this specific period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $317.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $309.29
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $294.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $309.69

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's relatively close to the 60-day moving average, indicating potential consolidation or a minor pullback.  The recent price increase of $1.84 (from the previous close) reflects positive short-term movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.22 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback might be imminent.
* **PPO:** 1.40 – A positive PPO value suggests upward momentum, but it's relatively modest.
* **Relative Divergence:**  A recent increase in relative divergence of 7.1 points to short-term upward momentum.

The expected return of -0.4% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 suggests potential underperformance compared to the market index.  This is consistent with the previous cumulative return comparison.

APD shows strong financial fundamentals with consistent revenue and improving profit margins.  However,  recent performance has lagged the S&P 500.
