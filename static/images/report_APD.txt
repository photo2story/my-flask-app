**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Shows generally strong growth in earlier periods, sharply declining and turning negative in recent years.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:** Initially positive, but becomes increasingly negative, suggesting APD is underperforming relative to its expected return based on its risk profile.
*   **Beta:** Consistently below 1 until the most recent period (2023-2025), indicating lower volatility than the market, but drastically jumps to 2.3 in the latest period. This suggests that the stock has become dramatically more volatile relative to the market recently.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization grew, then decreased recently.

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly down in the most recent market session. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, but both are below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a possible short-term upward trend, but still below the medium-term trend.

*   RSI: 48.11 (Neutral)
*   PPO: 0.38

*   Expected Return: -574.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **Hybrid Signal:** Recommends buying the stock, but it is based on a different MRI calculation (0.90, Very Safe), which contrasts with the provided MRI (0.8, Medium Investment).
*   **Divergence Change:** The decrease in relative divergence implies that APD's performance is worsening compared to the S&P 500 over the last 20 days.
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally negative expected return is a major red flag.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Guggenheim Capital LLC Trimmed APD Holdings:** Suggests some institutional investors are reducing their positions.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   Consensus: Buy (~1.87)
*   Target Price: 308.86 (Avg), 350.00 (High), 260.00 (Low)

**Analysis:** Despite the stock's recent struggles, analysts still have a generally positive outlook, with a consensus "Buy" rating and an average target price significantly above the current price. However, the low target price matches the current stock price. The absence of recent rating changes make it difficult to determine the direction of analysts' sentiment.
