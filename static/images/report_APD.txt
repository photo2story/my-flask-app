**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $316.12
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $312.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $323.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $313.12

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. The recent slight price increase (+$0.30) is not significant enough to alter this overall trend.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (38.8):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a short-term buying opportunity.
* **PPO (-0.787):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** 0.0 (-) indicates a recent downward trend.

The combination of a low RSI and negative PPO, along with the recent price movement, points to a bearish short-term outlook. The expected return of -3.8% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 further reinforces this bearish sentiment for long term performance.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

APD has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While the company maintains strong profit margins, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook. Inconsistent earnings and ROE figures warrant further investigation.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises concerns about future performance.  More data and in-depth analysis are required for a complete and confident investment recommendation.  The duplicated data point needs to be addressed to ensure the accuracy of the analysis.
