*   **Alpha:** Alpha, representing risk-adjusted performance, has turned sharply negative, significantly underperforming its benchmark in recent years.
*   **Beta:** Beta has increased over time, suggesting the stock is becoming more sensitive to market movements (more volatile relative to the S&P 500). It recently jumped to 2.3 (2023-2025).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization generally increased until recently, when it began to decrease from 68.6 to 53.4, as the stock price fell.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 239.96
*   **Last Market (price):** 239.96 (previousClose: 243.75, change: -1.55)
*   **5-day SMA:** 243.47
*   **20-day SMA:** 250.079
*   **60-day SMA:** 254.9732

**Analysis:** The current price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA), indicating a downtrend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, reinforcing the short-term downtrend. The recent market close shows a negative change, reflecting continued selling pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 35.38 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** -0.237
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (Negative short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1444.7

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is approaching oversold territory, which *could* indicate a potential for a rebound, but it's not a definitive signal. The negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, reinforcing the downtrend. The Hybrid Signal is recommending a "Buy" position with the remaining cash. The very high negative expected return suggests very poor prospects compared to the S&P 500. The Recent (20 days) relative divergence change confirms the short-term decline.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Headlines Dominate:** The news headlines are overwhelmingly negative, highlighting a stock price drop, downgrades from analysts, and concerns about the company's performance.
*   **Key Concerns:** The news items focus on the recent 25% drop, hitting 52-week lows, and analyst downgrades indicating decreased confidence in the stock.
*   **Specific Examples:**
    *   Forbes asks "What's Next With APD Stock After A 25% Drop?"
    *   Quiver Quantitative notes a 10% drop.
    *   ts2.tech connects the price drop to the Yara Hydrogen deal.
    *   GuruFocus reports a downgrade from Wells Fargo.
*   **Guggenheim Capital LLC Trimmed Holdings:** This suggests that at least one institutional investor has reduced their position in the stock.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.13)
*   **Opinions:** 21
*   **Target Price:** Average: $292.86 / High: $340.00 / Low: $245.00

**Analysis:** While the analyst consensus is still leaning towards a "Buy," the target prices provide context. The average target price ($292.86) is *significantly* higher than the current price ($239.96), suggesting potential upside *if* the analysts' expectations are met. However, the recent downgrades mentioned in the news section suggest that these targets might be revised downwards soon. The range of target prices ($245.00 - $340.00) shows considerable uncertainty among analysts. No rating changes were provided.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출      |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 2025-07-31 | 3.2   | 3.02 B$   |
| 2025-05-01 | -7.77  | 2.92 B$   |
| 2025-02-06 | 2.77  | 2.93 B$   |
| 2024-08-01 | 3.13  | 2.99 B$   |
| 2025-07-31 | 3.13  | 2.99 B$   |

**Analysis:** The earnings data shows volatility. There's a significant negative EPS in 2025-05-01, which likely contributed to the recent stock price decline. While other quarters show positive EPS, the revenue figures are relatively stable, suggesting potential challenges in increasing profitability or managing costs.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Based on the data provided, APD appears to be a risky investment at this time. The negative news flow, underperformance relative to the market, declining ROE, and downtrending price action raise concerns. While analysts still have a buy consensus, the recent price action and analyst downgrades should be carefully considered. A deeper dive into the reasons for the negative EPS quarter, the company's strategy to address the underperformance, and the specific details of the Yara Hydrogen deal's impact would be essential before making any investment decision. The very negative Expected Return suggests a potentially significant loss compared to the market.
