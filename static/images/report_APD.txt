**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD), a leading industrial gas company, based on provided financial data.  We will compare its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), assess recent price movements, and evaluate key financial indicators.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500:**

Air Products and Chemicals Inc. is a leading industrial gas company that produces, sells and distributes atmospheric gases.

* **APD Cumulative Return:** 25.39%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 65.78%
* **Return Difference:** -40.4%
* **Relative Divergence:** 22.3% (This means APD's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is in the 22.3rd percentile of historical divergence, based on a range from a minimum of -64.6% to a maximum of 43.9%).


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different periods. While alpha (outperformance relative to the market) is generally positive, indicating some degree of outperformance, it is variable, and beta (volatility relative to the market) shows higher values in recent years (2023-2025), suggesting higher market sensitivity during this period. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is highly variable across different periods and the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) also points to high levels of volatility.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has seen growth over the period.  The high volatility and inconsistent performance need to be considered carefully.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 23.0% | 53.7% | -6.0% | 0.1 | 31.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 22.0% | 62.1% | 5.0% | 0.4 | 31.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 50.0% | 62.1% | 21.0% | 0.8 | 47.6 |
| 2018-2020  | 36.0% | 62.1% | 10.0% | 0.6 | 56.5 |
| 2019-2021  | 59.0% | 59.2% | 5.0% | 0.6 | 64.3 |
| 2020-2022  | 22.0% | 71.4% | 16.0% | 0.6 | 66.8 |
| 2021-2023  | -18.0% | 71.4% | -35.0% | 0.8 | 60.8 |

* **Closing Price:** $262.04
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $260.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $283.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $304.26

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a possible downtrend.  The recent decline of $3.02 (-1.12%) from the previous close further supports this.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 34.13 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, but this should be interpreted cautiously in conjunction with other indicators)
* **PPO:** -0.98 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -31.1% (This suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, given the current circumstances. This is a projection and not a guarantee.)

The significant negative price change of -3.02 and the negative expected return suggest a bearish outlook.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistency in EPS and revenue.  While revenue remains relatively stable around $2.9B-$3.0B, EPS fluctuates.  There is a need for further investigation into the causes of these fluctuations.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

APD's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the period examined, with a substantial negative return difference. While the company displays healthy profit margins and growing equity, recent price action and technical indicators point to a bearish outlook.  The inconsistent earnings data and volatile ROE warrant further investigation.  The high Maximum Drawdowns and fluctuating CAGR also highlight significant risk.  The -31.1% projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern.  Before investing, further due diligence including an in-depth analysis of the company’s fundamentals and future outlook is recommended.  The high volatility should be carefully considered before investing.
