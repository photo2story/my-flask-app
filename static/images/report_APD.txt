**Analysis:** APD has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently. The large negative divergence indicates a substantial deviation from the market benchmark. The relative divergence being at 0.0 suggests this underperformance is near its worst level within the observed range.  The Alpha, Beta analysis reveals a concerning trend of declining alpha and increasing beta, particularly in recent years.  A high beta of 2.3 in the 2023-2025 period suggests APD is now significantly more volatile than the market. The negative alpha values across most periods indicate underperformance relative to what would be expected based on its beta.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** 237.095
*   **Last Market Close:** Price: 237.18, Previous Close: 240.77, Change: -1.49
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 242.409
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 253.1405
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 274.8575

**Analysis:** APD's current price is below all its short-term and medium-term moving averages, indicating a recent downtrend. The negative change in the last market close further confirms this bearish momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 14.53 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.40
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (11 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term Decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** -2822.4%

**Analysis:** The RSI value indicates that APD is currently oversold, which *could* suggest a potential for a rebound.  However, the PPO value, though negative, isn't extremely low, suggesting the downward momentum is moderate.  The Hybrid Signal reflects an oversold condition and recommends a buy. The recent decrease in relative divergence indicates that the underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is worsening in the short term. The negative expected return is *extremely* concerning and suggests very poor long-term prospects relative to the S&P 500 *based on the model used to generate this number*. The MRI, despite the other negative signals, still indicates a high investment recommendation, which could be a lagging indicator or based on a different set of factors. The Last-market price changes {'price': 237.18, 'previousClose': 240.77, 'change': -1.49} is not dramatically big.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출       |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-07-31 | 3.2    | 3.02 B$    |

**Analysis:** APD's earnings have been volatile. There was a significant loss in one quarter, offset with positive EPS from other quarters. There's a typo in the table with the same date listed twice (2025-07-31), so this warrants further investigation into correct EPS for those dates.

**Analysis:** Revenue has fluctuated slightly, with a relatively healthy profit margin. However, the ROE shows significant volatility. The negative ROE in one quarter is concerning and aligns with the negative EPS reported in the earnings analysis. Equity also shows a volatile trend.

**7. Overall Summary**

Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Signals:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative expected return, recent downtrend in stock price, volatile earnings and ROE, and concerning news headlines regarding earnings challenges.
*   **Positive Signals:** Oversold RSI (potential for rebound), high Market Risk Indicator, analyst "Buy" rating with significant upside potential.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, APD appears to be facing significant challenges. The underperformance against the S&P 500, combined with volatile earnings and ROE, raises concerns about its financial health and future prospects. While the oversold RSI and analyst ratings offer some hope for a rebound, the negative signals outweigh the positives.

**Recommendation:**

Given the significant negative indicators, a cautious approach to APD is warranted. Before investing, a deeper investigation into the underlying causes of the underperformance, earnings volatility, and the disconnect between the analyst ratings and the other indicators is crucial. It would also be beneficial to compare APD to its peers and conduct a thorough fundamental analysis. The Extremely negative expected return needs to be verified.
