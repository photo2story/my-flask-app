Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD) based on the data provided:

**1. Return Rate Comparison & Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Air Products and Chemicals Inc. is an industrial gases company providing essential atmospheric and process gases and related equipment to manufacturing markets.
*   **APD Cumulative Return:** -9.72%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 99.09%

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|------|--------|

| 2022-2024  | -39.0% | 79.4%  | -59.0% | 0.9  | 64.6   |
| 2023-2025  | -66.0% | 74.8%  | -130.0% | 2.2  | 54.3   |

**Analysis:**
*   **CAGR & MDD:** The table shows decreasing CAGR in recent years. Maximum Drawdown (MDD) are high throughout all periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha has become strongly negative recently, suggesting that APD is significantly underperforming relative to its expected return based on market risk.
*   **Beta:**  Beta increased significantly to 2.2 in the recent period. This implies increased volatility and sensitivity to market movements, making it more affected by changes in the S&P 500, which carries greater risk.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 243.75
*   **Previous Close:** 246.38
*   **Change:** -1.07
*   **5-day SMA:** 244.078
*   **20-day SMA:** 250.6355
*   **60-day SMA:** 255.4035

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a potential downward trend.  The negative change from the previous close further reinforces this.

**3. RSI, PPO Index, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 36.03
*   **PPO:** -0.2096
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 3.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -907.3

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment rating, although the recommendation within the Hybrid Signal suggests "Very Safe." This might be due to a specific portfolio strategy or risk tolerance assumption used in its calculation.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 36.03 suggests that the stock is nearing oversold conditions.  This *could* indicate a potential for a short-term bounce.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, further reinforcing a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal is recommending a Buy with 100% cash allocation which implies a long term bullish position.
*   **Divergence Change:** The short-term relative divergence has increased, suggesting a potential short-term rebound.  However, this needs to be considered in the context of the overall downtrend.
*   **Expected Return:** A highly negative expected return (-907.3%) is a significant red flag, indicating extremely poor long-term projections relative to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Options Trading:** News about options trading simply indicates the availability of derivative instruments.
*   **Price Target Cuts:** Mizuho lowered the price target for APD, which is generally negative sentiment.
*   **52-Week Low:** The stock hitting a 52-week low after a hydrogen deal raises concerns.
*   **Stock Down 10%:**  A double-digit drop in a single day is a significant negative event.
*   **Analyst Downgrades:**  (Information missing) It will be meaningful depending on whether the analyst ratings were downgraded.

**Analysis:** The news flow is overwhelmingly negative.  Price target cuts, reaching 52-week lows, and a significant single-day drop all point to investor concern and potentially weakening fundamentals.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.04)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 297.14 / 340.00 / 245.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Missing data.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is a "Buy," which contrasts sharply with the negative news, poor performance relative to the S&P 500, and extremely low expected return. This disconnect requires further investigation. Analyst ratings may not have caught up with recent negative developments. The target price range is broad, with the low end near the current price, suggesting limited upside according to some analysts.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출       |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-07-31 | 3.2    | 3.02 B$    |
| 2025-05-01 | -7.77  | 2.92 B$    |
| 2025-02-06 | 2.77   | 2.93 B$    |
| 2024-08-01 | 3.13   | 2.99 B$    |
| 2025-07-31 | 3.13   | 2.99 B$    |

**Analysis:** The earnings data shows mixed results. While some quarters have positive EPS, the negative EPS figure in 2025-05-01 is concerning. Revenue is relatively stable, but the inconsistency in EPS raises questions about profitability.

**6. Financial Information**

| 2024-09-30 | $17.04B   | 11.45%    |

**Analysis:** Revenue has been relatively stable, but profit margins have fluctuated. The ROE has also shown significant volatility, with a concerning negative value in 2025-03-31 and a very low value most recently. Equity is also declining, which may be an issue.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

APD is facing significant headwinds:

*   **Underperformance:** The stock has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Sentiment:** News headlines are primarily negative, with price target cuts and the stock hitting 52-week lows.
*   **Mixed Earnings:** Recent earnings are mixed, with inconsistent EPS figures and fluctuating ROE.
*   **Downtrend:** Technical indicators suggest a downtrend.
*   **High Beta, Negative Alpha:** High beta indicates greater sensitivity to market volatility, while negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to its expected return.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** A "Buy" consensus from analysts conflicts with negative news and financial performance.
*   **Extremely Low Expected Return:** The projected expected return is shockingly low (-907.3%).

**Conclusion:** While the medium MRI indicates a medium investment rating, the overwhelmingly negative signals suggest caution. Further research is critical before making any investment decisions. Possible reasons for the negative outlook could include: macroeconomic headwinds, company-specific challenges (execution problems, changing regulations, disruption, or unforeseen costs), and overvaluation in prior periods, which is now correcting.
