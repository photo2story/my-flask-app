**7. 종합 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD) has been underperforming the S&P 500 significantly, particularly in recent periods. The negative EPS and ROE in the most recent quarter are major concerns, indicating potential profitability issues.

The technical indicators show a recent short-term positive price movement, but the RSI suggests the stock may be approaching overbought levels. The negative expected return indicates analysts' pessimistic outlook for APD's long-term performance relative to the market.

**Conclusion**

Based on the provided data, APD appears to be facing challenges. The negative earnings, ROE, and negative long-term expected return warrant careful consideration. While there's been a recent price increase, it might be a short-term correction rather than a sustained upward trend. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence, closely monitor company news and financial reports, and carefully assess their risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. The negative EPS and negative relative disparity change are the most concerning signals.
