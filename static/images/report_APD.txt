**Analysis:**

*   **Underperformance:** APD has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial negative divergence in cumulative return.  The relative divergence being low (5.0) suggests the current underperformance is near the worst it has been in the tracked range.
*   **Alpha & Beta:** The Alpha shows periods of outperformance (positive Alpha) in the past, but more recently, the Alpha has been strongly negative, indicating underperformance relative to the market. The Beta has been consistently below 1 in the early periods indicating lower volatility than the market, but the Beta has been increasing toward and above 1.0 in the recent period, showing the stock is now more volatile than the S&P 500. This is particularly pronounced in the most recent period (2023-2025) with a very high Beta of 2.3.  This suggests that APD's price swings are now much larger than the market's.
*   **CAGR and MDD:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) was strong in earlier periods but has deteriorated significantly, turning sharply negative in recent years.  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures are high, indicating substantial potential for loss during the observed periods.

*   **20-day SMA:** 257.10
*   **60-day SMA:** 263.22

**Analysis:**

*   **Price Trend:** The stock price is currently fluctuating around the $260 level. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which *could* indicate a short-term upward trend. However, the 60-day SMA is higher than both, suggesting a possible longer-term downward trend or stabilization point.
*   **Minor Decline:** The slight decrease in the last market data (-0.36 change) contributes to the short term downward trend.

*   **Expected Return:** -574.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **RSI:** An RSI of 48.11 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.

*   **Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence (-3.4) reinforces the short-term downward trend indicated by the SMAs.
*   **Concerning Expected Return:**  The extremely negative expected return (-574.1%) is a major red flag, suggesting very significant downside risk if held long-term.
