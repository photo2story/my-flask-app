**Analysis:**

APD has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently. The large negative absolute divergence (-76.1) and very low relative divergence (0.6) confirm this.  Looking at the Alpha/Beta analysis, we can see a trend of deteriorating performance in recent years. The Alpha is strongly negative in the more recent periods, indicating APD has not generated excess returns relative to its risk (Beta). The Beta fluctuates but has been trending higher, suggesting increased sensitivity to market movements.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has also turned negative in the last few periods, and the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, indicating significant price volatility.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 292.45
*   **Previous Close:** 290.63
*   **Change:** 0.63
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 290.074
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 291.7855
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 290.8925

**Analysis:**

The stock price is slightly up from the previous close. The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which *could* be seen as a short-term bullish sign, but more data is needed. The relatively small change from the previous close suggests no major price shock or volatility event currently.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.3324 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 46.03
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.0468
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.33)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.2 (Positive - short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -1626.6%

**Analysis:**

The MRI indicates a "Low Risk" environment. The RSI of 46.03 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The negative PPO (-0.0468) indicates a slight bearish trend in momentum. The Hybrid Signal is recommending deploying cash and buying, though not aggressively, aligning with the "Safe" designation due to the low MRI. The positive change in relative divergence over the last 20 days suggests a recent improvement in APD's performance relative to the benchmark. *However*, the **extremely negative Expected Return** (-1626.6%) is a major red flag. This suggests a very pessimistic outlook for APD compared to the S&P 500 over a longer-term investment horizon.

*   **[2025-09-05]** Air Products Publishes 2025 Sustainability Report (PR Newswire)

**Analysis:**

The recent news paints a mixed picture.  The upgrade from Argus and the price target adjustment from TD Cowen are positive, indicating some analyst confidence.  The news about showcasing food freezing solutions is standard business activity. However, the article questioning APD's underperformance relative to the Nasdaq raises concerns, echoing the earlier findings regarding its performance compared to the S&P 500. The sustainability report is a positive from an ESG perspective, but its direct impact on stock price is often less immediate.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.91)
*   **Opinions:** 21
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 324.14 / 375.00 / 275.00

**Analysis:**

Despite the recent underperformance, analysts generally have a "Buy" rating on APD. The average target price ($324.14) is above the current price, suggesting potential upside. However, it's crucial to consider that target prices are just estimates and can be wrong.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출     |
|------------|--------|----------|
| 2025-07-31 | 3.20   | 3.02 B$  |
| 2025-05-01 | -7.77  | 2.92 B$  |
| 2025-02-06 | 2.77   | 2.93 B$  |
| 2024-08-01 | 3.13   | 2.99 B$  |
| 2025-07-31 | 3.13   | 2.99 B$  |

**Analysis:**

The recent earnings data is volatile. While the most recent EPS is positive (3.20), there was a significant negative EPS (-7.77) in the prior period. Revenue has been relatively stable around $2.9-3.0 billion. This inconsistency in earnings adds to the concerns about APD's current performance. The repeated 2025-07-31 entry is unusual and should be checked for accuracy in the original dataset.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30   | $3.02B   | 32.51%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $2.92B   | 29.57%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $2.93B   | 31.21%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $3.19B   | 33.98%        |
| 2024-06-30   | $2.99B   | 32.82%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE      |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| 2025-06-30   | $15.54B   | 4.59%    |
| 2025-03-31   | $14.70B   | -11.77%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $16.69B   | 3.70%    |
| 2024-09-30   | $17.04B   | 11.45%   |
| 2024-06-30   | $15.10B   | 4.61%    |

**Analysis:**

Revenue has been relatively consistent. Profit margins are healthy, generally in the 30%+ range. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is quite volatile, with a significant drop into negative territory in the 2025-03-31 quarter. This suggests issues with profitability relative to the company's equity base during that period.

**7. Overall Summary**

Air Products and Chemicals (APD) is currently facing challenges. While analysts maintain a "Buy" rating, the data reveals significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, volatile earnings and ROE, and a concerningly negative Expected Return. The recent news includes some positive analyst sentiment but also highlights concerns about underperformance.

**Key Concerns:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:** APD is lagging the broader market (S&P 500).
*   **Negative Expected Return:**  The model projects APD to significantly underperform the S&P 500 in the long term.
*   **Volatile Earnings and ROE:** Inconsistent financial performance raises concerns.

**Potential Positives:**

*   **Analyst Buy Ratings:** Analysts generally remain optimistic.
*   **Healthy Profit Margins:** APD maintains strong profitability on its revenue.
*   **Low Market Risk (MRI):** The overall market environment is considered relatively stable.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this data, a cautious approach is warranted. While analyst ratings are positive, the underlying financial data and performance indicators suggest significant risks. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and negative expected return. Before making any investment decisions, consult with a qualified financial advisor and conduct thorough due diligence.
