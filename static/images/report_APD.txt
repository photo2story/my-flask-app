* **20-day Moving Average:** $310.14
* **60-day Moving Average:** $311.29

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting upward momentum.  However, the relatively large gap between the short-term and long-term averages may signal some potential for correction.

* **PPO (1.01):** Positive and above the zero line, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+4.9):**  Short-term upward trend.
* **Price Change (Last Market):** A slight increase of $0.0477. This small change does not indicate a dramatic price movement (no 급반등 or 급하락).
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -1.1% relative to the S&P 500. This suggests a potential for slightly underperforming the market over the long run.  However, this figure must be interpreted cautiously as it doesn't factor in numerous possible external or business-related developments that could influence returns.

The long-term outlook, however, is uncertain, with the expected return suggesting a slightly lower performance than the S&P 500.
