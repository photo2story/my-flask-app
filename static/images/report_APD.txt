**6. Overall Analysis:**

APD's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500.  While some technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce, the negative expected return and consistently negative alpha suggest that long-term underperformance relative to the market is likely.  The company's financials show generally stable revenue and high profit margins, but further investigation is needed to understand the volatility in ROE and the inconsistencies in the alpha and beta.  A deeper dive into the earnings data and the causes for fluctuations in revenue and profitability is necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.  The provided data has inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings) that require clarification.
