**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information about recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions is provided.  This limits a comprehensive assessment of current market sentiment surrounding APD.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

APD has underperformed the S&P 500 in the given timeframe. While financial statements show some improvements in profit margins and equity, the recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  The RSI and PPO indicators don't offer a clear buy/sell signal. The lack of information on recent news and analyst sentiment hinders a definitive conclusion.  The 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a critical factor indicating that long-term investment may not outperform market averages.  Further investigation is needed before making investment decisions.  More detailed information including historical data, industry benchmarks, and analyst forecasts would be crucial for a thorough evaluation.
