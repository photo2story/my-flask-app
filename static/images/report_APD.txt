*   **Analysis:**  APD has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The negative cumulative return, and extremely low relative divergence, highlights considerable underperformance.
    *   **Alpha:**  The Alpha value, which measures performance relative to a benchmark, has been predominantly negative in recent periods, indicating underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The decline is accelerating, with a particularly alarming -123.0% in the 2023-2025 period.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta value, measuring volatility compared to the market, has hovered around 0.7-1.0. A beta less than 1 suggests that APD is theoretically less volatile than the overall market, however, the actual performance deviates significantly from this, given APD's returns. The Beta decreasing to 0.7 recently indicates decreasing price correlation with the S&P 500.
    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR has deteriorated significantly in recent years, turning deeply negative.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  MDD indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. The high MDD across all periods suggests high volatility and risk.
    *   **Capitalization (Cap):** The company's market capitalization shows some fluctuation, but has recently declined.

*   **Current Close:** 247.02

*   **Change:** -0.72
*   **5-day SMA:** 247.39
*   **20-day SMA:** 245.84
*   **60-day SMA:** 252.35

*   **Analysis:**  The current price is below the 5-day SMA but above the 20-day SMA, implying a possible short-term downward trend, and longer-term upward trend. The price is below the 60-day SMA, indicating that the price is trading below its recent averages. The small price drop from the previous day might signal further price weakness in the short term.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Market Risk Indicator**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 65.27 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.36

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 1.7 (Short-term increase, suggesting a short-term rise).
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI Contradiction:** Although the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, this seemingly contradicts the negative performance trends and news. This disparity warrants further investigation. The MRI may be based on a different, possibly lagging, dataset or model.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI above 65 indicates that the stock is nearing overbought conditions, suggesting that it may be due for a pullback.
    *   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, which typically indicates an uptrend (although weak).
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Very Safe" buy signal suggests that the system considers this to be a good point to enter the market.
    * Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: The short-term rise that is suggested from the relative divergence change also confirms this point.
    *   **Expected Return:**  A 0.0% expected return is not encouraging.
