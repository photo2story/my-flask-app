**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Air Products (APD) has a cumulative return of 83.88%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 112.74%.  This represents a difference of -28.9%.  The relative divergence of -28.9% places APD in the 24.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating it has underperformed the market over the measured period.

* **Closing Price:** $307.96
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $294.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $293.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $310.52

The current price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating some potential resistance at higher price levels.  The relatively close proximity of the current price to the moving averages suggests limited extreme volatility recently.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 66.17 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a pullback)
* **PPO:** 0.83 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +16.2% (Significant short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -0.1% (This suggests a slightly negative return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), based on current projections).  This is in line with the cumulative underperformance highlighted in section 1.

The current price of $307.96 doesn't indicate a significant recent rapid upward or downward movement, given the proximity to the moving averages.
