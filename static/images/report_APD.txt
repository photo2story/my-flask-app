## Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

APD, Air Products and Chemicals Inc., is an industrial gases company.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  Further analysis will delve into the reasons behind this divergence.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **APD Cumulative Return:** 37.87%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 78.93%
* **Return Difference:** -41.1%  (This indicates APD underperformed VOO by 41.1% over the measured period.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 22.4% (This means the current underperformance is in the 22.4th percentile relative to the historical range of divergence between APD and VOO. It's not exceptionally high or low relative to historical context.)

The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals a mixed picture. While Alpha is generally positive, indicating some outperformance, the Beta is consistently above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market.  The consistently high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) suggests significant periods of substantial losses. Note the dramatic decline projected for 2023-2025, a negative CAGR of 60%. This should be carefully considered.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $264.74
* **5-day Moving Average:** $262.38
* **20-day Moving Average:** $273.21
* **60-day Moving Average:** $297.28

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent price drop of -$0.23 from the previous close reinforces this downward trend.  It's a minor drop; however, the context of other indicators must be considered.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.65 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** 0.0891 (Slightly positive, suggesting a potential uptrend, but weak)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -0.6 (Short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return:** -26.9% (This suggests a substantial potential loss over the long term relative to the S&P 500. This is a crucial negative indicator.)

The negative expected return of -26.9% is a strong warning sign. Combined with other negative indicators, this casts doubt on the long-term viability of APD relative to a passive S&P 500 investment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-02-06 | $2.77   | $2.93 B       |
| 2024-08-01 | $3.13   | $2.99 B       |
| 2024-04-30 | $2.57   | $2.93 B       |

| 2023-12-31 | $2.74   | $3.00 B       |


Earnings show some volatility, with no clear upward or downward trend.  Revenue is relatively stable, but earnings fluctuate.  More data points are needed to make definitive conclusions.  The repetition of the Feb 6th 2025 entry suggests a data entry error that should be addressed.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.93B     | 31.21%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $3.19B     | 33.98%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.99B     | 32.82%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.93B     | 32.04%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.00B     | 31.03%        |

Profit margins are relatively stable and healthy, hovering around 32%.  Revenue shows minor fluctuations.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE           |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $16.69B    | 3.70%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.04B    | 11.45%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $15.10B    | 4.61%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $14.91B    | 3.84%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $14.87B    | 4.10%         |

Equity is relatively stable, but ROE fluctuates significantly, suggesting some inconsistency in profitability. The high ROE of 11.45% in Q3 2024 is an outlier requiring further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

APD's performance relative to the S&P 500 is significantly negative, even given the relative performance context.  The negative expected return, bearish price action (below moving averages), and a medium risk level based on the MRI raise serious concerns. While profit margins and revenue are relatively stable, the inconsistent ROE and projected future declines raise questions about APD's long-term prospects.  The significant negative projected CAGR for 2023-2025 demands further investigation into the underlying factors.  Given the current data, a long-term investment in APD appears riskier than a comparable investment in the S&P 500.  Further due diligence, including a deeper dive into the reasons for the projected 2023-2025 decline and the outlier ROE figure, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
