**7. Overall Analysis:**

APD shows strong fundamentals with consistent revenue and healthy profit margins.  However, the current high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought in the short term, increasing the risk of a price correction.  While long-term prospects appear positive, the recent price surge warrants caution. The -1% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term needs further investigation. The discrepancy between the strong financial data and the negative expected return should be examined more thoroughly.  Further analysis considering industry trends and competitor performance is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Clarification on the duplicate earnings data is also needed.
