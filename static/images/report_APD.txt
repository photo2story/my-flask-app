**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last 2 days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

APD's recent performance has lagged the S&P 500.  While the company shows consistent revenue and generally strong profit margins, the recent EPS performance is inconsistent.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, but its relative weakness against the market and a 0% projected return raise concerns.  Further analysis, including missing news and analyst opinions, is needed for a complete assessment.  The provided data alone does not offer a clear buy or sell recommendation.


**8. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta data show relatively low beta (around 0.2), suggesting low volatility compared to the market. Alpha values are generally positive but vary over time, implying inconsistent market-beating performance.  The increasing market capitalization reflects the company's growth, but the inconsistent ROE and CAGR figures from year to year suggest some level of cyclical behaviour is present.  Note that these are historical numbers, not necessarily predictive of the future.
