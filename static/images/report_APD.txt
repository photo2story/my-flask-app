**7.  Comprehensive Analysis:**

APD has demonstrated a history of strong growth but recently underperformed the S&P 500.  Its beta near 1 indicates market correlation.  While its financial statements point to consistent profitability and relatively stable revenue, the recent RSI suggests potential short-term overvaluation.

Additional information is needed to assess the expected return accurately.  A thorough examination of earnings calls and analyst reports would provide a more comprehensive picture.

Air Products and Chemicals (APD) shows a mixed picture.  Historically, strong growth has been seen, yet recent performance relative to the S&P 500 has been weaker.  Financials are solid, with consistent profitability.  However, technical indicators suggest potential short-term overbought conditions.  More information is needed, particularly regarding recent news, analyst estimates for the most recent earnings, and a clarification on the provided 0% long-term expected return, to provide a more definitive investment recommendation.  A closer examination of industry trends and competitive landscape would further inform an investment decision.
