* **20-Day Moving Average:** $322.30
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $312.35

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.4 - A slight positive change in the relative strength, implying a potential short-term upward trend.  However, this is contradicted by the RSI and PPO.
* **Expected Return:** -4.5% -  This suggests that over the long-term (2+ years), APD is expected to underperform the S&P 500 by 4.5%. This needs to be considered in context of the significant negative alpha values.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

APD has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly in the recent period, with negative alpha and high beta indicating greater market sensitivity. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions and a potential short-term bounce, negative PPO and the overall trend in the price suggest continued bearishness.  The financial information shows stable profit margins and fluctuating revenue and equity.  Long-term investment decisions should consider the consistently negative alpha values (particularly recently), high MDD in recent years, and the projected negative return relative to the S&P 500.  More in-depth analysis, including examination of the company's specific strategies and industry trends, is needed before drawing definitive conclusions.  Addressing inconsistencies and potential errors in the provided data is crucial for a more accurate analysis.
