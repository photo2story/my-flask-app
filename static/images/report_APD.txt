**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows a significant decline in recent periods, with negative growth in the last three reported periods.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is increasingly negative, particularly in the most recent period, suggesting significant underperformance relative to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally below 1, but increases to 2.3 in 2023-2025, indicating that the stock has become much more volatile compared to the market.
*   **Cap:** The Market Cap fluctuated over the years.

*   **Last-market:** price change = 0.81
*   **5-day SMA:** 258.58
*   **20-day SMA:** 254.11
*   **60-day SMA:** 264.67

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently above both its 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term upward trend.

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 51.99
*   **PPO:** 0.4674
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 2.0 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -306.4%

**Analysis:**

*   The high MRI (0.9) suggests a high level of safety, yet this contradicts with the negative future expected return.
*   The RSI of 51.99 is neutral, not indicating either overbought or oversold conditions.
*   The PPO is low, indicating a recent uptrend.
*   The recommendation to buy 100% cash allocated suggests the AI consider the current price as undervalued.
*   The positive short-term relative divergence change aligns with the recent price increase, but it's essential to weigh this against the substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   The Extremely Negative Expected Return is a major concern. This suggests a very pessimistic outlook for APD's future performance, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Shares Sold/Bought:** Some institutions have sold shares (Russell Investments), while others have bought (State Board of Administration of Florida Retirement System). This indicates mixed sentiment.
*   **Conference Participation:** APD's CEO and CFO are participating in a Citi Basic Materials Conference, suggesting active communication with the investment community.
*   **"New Buy Stock" (Nasdaq):**  This is a positive headline, but needs to be examined in light of the Seeking Alpha article.
*   **Hydrogen Investment Headlines:**  APD's hydrogen investments are generating news, reflecting a strategic focus.
*   **Seeking Alpha Article:** "No Rush To Buy With Much Of The Turnaround Priced In (APD) - Seeking Alpha" This suggests that while a turnaround might be anticipated, the current price already reflects those expectations.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. While there's interest in APD's hydrogen investments and some positive ratings, there are also cautions about its turnaround potential already being priced in. The institutional trading activity is also mixed.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (1.87)
*   **Target Price:** 308.62 (avg), 350.00 (high), 260.00 (low)

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating for APD and a target price significantly above the current price. However, the low target price of $260.00 is roughly the same as the current price, and suggests that some analysts have a neutral view. The lack of Recent Rating Changes suggests that analysts have not been revising the rating.

*   **Volatility:** The stock has historically been very volatile.
*   **Negative Outlook:** The expected return of -306.4% is a major red flag, suggesting a very pessimistic future outlook.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Analyst ratings are generally positive ("Buy"), but target prices vary widely. The recent news is also mixed, with some institutional buying and selling activity.
*   **Financials:** Revenue is stable, but declining equity and volatile ROE are concerning.

**Recommendation:** Given the significant underperformance, negative outlook, and mixed signals, a cautious approach to investing in APD is warranted.
