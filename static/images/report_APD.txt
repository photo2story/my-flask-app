*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has fluctuated, with a notable decrease in the most recent quarter.  The ROE has dramatically dropped to a negative value, reflecting the losses. The negative ROE in the most recent quarter reinforces the concerns raised by the negative EPS.

**7. Overall Assessment & Recommendation**

Based on the provided data, APD presents a mixed picture with significant cause for concern:

*   **Underperformance:** APD has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the long-term expected return is highly negative.
*   **Declining Profitability:** Recent earnings and financial data reveal declining profit margins and a concerning loss in the most recent quarter, leading to a negative ROE.
*   **Increased Volatility:** Beta has increased, indicating higher sensitivity to market movements.
*   **Technical Signals:** Technical indicators provide mixed signals, with some short-term positive signs offset by longer-term bearish trends.

**Recommendation:**

A *cautious* approach is warranted.  **Avoid increasing APD holdings**. Further investigation into the reasons for the recent losses and declining profitability is crucial before considering any further investment. The significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, coupled with the negative expected return, suggests that there may be better investment opportunities available.  Monitor company news and announcements closely for any indications of a turnaround.
