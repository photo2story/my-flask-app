**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

APD significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, showing a -43.5% difference in cumulative returns.  The provided alpha and beta data reveals mixed results across different time periods. While positive alphas suggest outperformance in some periods (2016-2018, 2017-2019, 2018-2020, 2019-2021), negative CAGR and high MDD in recent years (2021-2025) point to considerable underperformance and high risk.  The beta generally hovers around 1, indicating a relatively high correlation with the overall market, yet the recent negative performance suggests that this correlation hasn't been advantageous.  The market cap has fluctuated, largely remaining between $50B and $70B.  The extremely low projected CAGR for 2023-2025 (-59%) is a major cause for concern.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $268.85
* **5-day Moving Average:** $263.89
* **20-day Moving Average:** $271.98
* **60-day Moving Average:** $296.34

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the 60-day MA indicates a significant price drop in recent months.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.20 (slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting a slightly bearish momentum.)
* **PPO:** 0.30 (positive, indicating bullish momentum, though relatively weak)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.5% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -30.9% (A significant negative expected return over the long term, relative to the S&P 500.)  This suggests that APD's expected return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's expected return, even when considering a long-term investment horizon.

The combination of a medium risk level, below-neutral RSI, and negative expected return raises significant concerns about the stock's potential for future growth.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2025-05-01 | -7.77 | $2.92 B      |
| 2025-02-06 | 2.77  | $2.93 B      |
| 2024-08-01 | 3.13  | $2.99 B      |
| 2024-04-30 | 2.57  | $2.93 B      |
| 2025-05-01 | 2.57  | $2.93 B      | *(Duplicate entry?)*


The most recent earnings report shows a significant drop in EPS to a negative value (-7.77).  Revenue remains relatively stable, but the sharp decline in profitability is a very negative sign. The duplicate entry for May 1st, 2025 needs clarification.  Further investigation into the cause of the negative EPS is crucial.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data severely limits a comprehensive financial analysis. This missing data prevents a thorough assessment of the company's financial health and profitability beyond the provided EPS and revenue figures.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

APD's recent performance is concerning. While historical data shows periods of outperformance relative to the S&P 500, the recent trend demonstrates substantial underperformance, marked by a significant negative expected return (-30.9%), negative EPS, and price movement below all key moving averages.  The missing financial data hinders a complete picture, but the available evidence strongly suggests a high-risk investment with limited upside potential in the near to medium term. The substantial negative CAGR projections for 2023-2025 are especially alarming.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent decline in earnings and profitability is warranted before considering any investment.
