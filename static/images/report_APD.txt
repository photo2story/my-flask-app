| 2023-2025  | -65.0% | 74.8% | -133.0% | 2.3  | 55.1   |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate has deteriorated sharply in recent periods, going from positive to significantly negative.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown remains consistently high, indicating substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha has become deeply negative recently, meaning APD has significantly underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.  The -133% Alpha in 2023-2025 is very concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta has generally increased over time and is very high (2.3) in the most recent period, suggesting the stock has become much more volatile than the market, exacerbating losses during market downturns.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization in Billions of dollars shows the general size of the company.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 247.42
*   **Last Market Change:** +0.64
*   **5-day SMA:** 244.55
*   **20-day SMA:** 247.63
*   **60-day SMA:** 253.36

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly above its 5-day moving average but below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a potential short-term upward trend but a longer-term downward trend. The current price is below the 60-day SMA, suggesting potential resistance.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.01
*   **PPO:** 0.21
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (4 shares) - Very Safe - MRI:0.90, with a small monthly investment.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.8 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1444.7%

**Analysis:**

*   The high MRI suggests the model believes the market is currently undervalued.
*   The RSI of 40.01 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), suggesting potential for a rebound.
*   The PPO is positive but close to zero, indicating that the recent price movement has been positive but minimal and not enough to initiate a stronger trend.
*   Despite the "Buy" signal and high MRI, the extremely negative expected return (-1444.7%) is a huge red flag. This suggests the model anticipates continued underperformance compared to the S&P 500. The recent relative divergence confirms a short-term downtrend.
*   A large positive or negative "change" in the last market price indicates volatility.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Several headlines indicate recent drops in APD stock price, including hitting a 52-week low and being a top decliner in the S&P 500.
*   **Reasons for Decline:** The news mentions a Yara hydrogen deal as a potential catalyst for the price drop.
*   **Analyst Coverage:** Bernstein reiterated an "Outperform" rating, suggesting mixed sentiment.
*   **Institutional Selling:** Meyer Handelman Co. sold shares of APD, potentially adding to downward pressure.

**Analysis:** The news flow is predominantly negative, citing price declines and institutional selling. The Yara hydrogen deal seems to be a point of concern. While Bernstein's "Outperform" rating offers a contrasting view, the overall picture is bearish.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~2.13)
*   **Target Price:** $292.86 (avg) / $340 (high) / $245 (low)

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating and a target price significantly above the current price. However, the low target price is very close to the current price, suggesting at least one analyst sees little upside.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출      |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2025-07-31 | 3.2    | 3.02 B$   |
| 2025-05-01 | -7.77  | 2.92 B$   |
| 2025-02-06 | 2.77   | 2.93 B$   |

| 2025-07-31 | 3.13   | 2.99 B$   |

**Analysis:** The earnings data is mixed. There's a large negative EPS in one quarter (2025-05-01). Revenue has been relatively stable around $3 billion. The repetition of the 2024-08-01 entry is likely an error.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

APD is currently underperforming significantly compared to the S&P 500. Recent news is largely negative, citing price drops and institutional selling, potentially triggered by concerns about the Yara hydrogen deal. Earnings have been mixed, and while revenue has been relatively stable, ROE has been volatile and recently poor. Technical indicators suggest a potential oversold bounce, but the extremely negative expected return is a major warning sign. The high beta also indicates greater volatility than the overall market.

**Conclusion:**

Despite the "Buy" consensus and the high MRI, the negative indicators outweigh the positive ones. The negative expected return, negative alpha, high beta and the news flow suggest that APD may not be a good investment at this time. Further research is strongly recommended to understand the reasons behind the negative outlook and determine if the company's long-term prospects are still viable.
