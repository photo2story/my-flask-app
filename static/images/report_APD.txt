## Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (APD) is a leading industrial gases company that produces, sells, and distributes industrial gases and related equipment.

Over the period analyzed, APD's cumulative return (96.59%) lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (122.16%).  The difference is -25.6%, placing it at the 27.2nd percentile of the historical range of divergence (max: 62.4%, min: -58.5%). This suggests that while APD has shown positive returns, it has underperformed the broader market over this specific period.  The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows relatively consistent alpha of 0.2, indicating consistent outperformance over the benchmark by a small margin, although this is not reflected in the overall cumulative return. The Beta of around 0.2 suggests low correlation to the market. The high MDD in the recent years indicates higher risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $329.26
* **5-day Moving Average:** $321.56
* **20-day Moving Average:** $300.26
* **60-day Moving Average:** $309.71

The closing price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, and slightly above the 60-day moving average suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively large gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages suggests some volatility in the recent past.  The recent price change of +$1.62 shows a minor jump in price from the previous day's close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 90.23 – This extremely high RSI value indicates the stock is significantly overbought, suggesting a potential pullback is likely in the near term.
* **PPO:** 1.50 – A positive PPO value suggests a bullish momentum. However, given the extremely high RSI, this momentum may be unsustainable.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +3.6 – Shows short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** -0.8% – This indicates a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This prediction should be treated cautiously, as many factors influence future returns.

The combination of a very high RSI and positive PPO might indicate a potential for a short-term pullback, even with the current upward momentum.

APD has shown relatively strong financial performance, however, its cumulative return has lagged behind the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. The high RSI indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a potential near-term correction.  The positive PPO suggests upward momentum, but it should be viewed in light of the extreme RSI. Long-term prospects need further investigation. The provided expected return (-0.8%) against the S&P 500 should be interpreted with caution and requires deeper fundamental analysis.  The earnings and financial data show variability that needs further investigation.  Inconsistencies in the provided data need clarification.
