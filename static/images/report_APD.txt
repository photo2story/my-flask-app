**6. Overall Analysis:**

APD's recent performance has underperformed the S&P 500, with a negative expected return relative to the market.  While the company shows healthy profit margins and revenue,  the recent negative alpha and below-average return relative to the market raise concerns.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  Further investigation is needed to determine the reasons for the underperformance and to assess the long-term investment potential.  A deeper dive into the factors driving the variations in EPS, ROE, and the recent negative alpha is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The relatively neutral RSI and the potential positive upward momentum suggested by the PPO warrant further monitoring.
