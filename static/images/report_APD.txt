* **20-Day Moving Average:** $310.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $315.62

The stock is trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (14.73):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce. However, it's crucial to consider the context of the broader market and other factors.
* **PPO (-0.70):** A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-3.5%):** Shows a recent weakening in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2.2%):**  This represents a modest long-term (2+ years) expected outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  This figure should be considered cautiously as it's a projected value and dependent on multiple underlying assumptions.  Given the current negative momentum indicators, the 2.2% outperformance is not guaranteed.
* **Current Price & Volatility:** The provided data does not indicate any major recent price volatility (sharp upturns or downturns) although the stock is trading significantly below its moving averages.

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-08-01).  Analyzing the unique entries:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates slightly, with no clear upward or downward trend apparent.
* **EPS:** EPS also shows some fluctuation, but again no clear trend.  There is no consistent increase or decrease from quarter to quarter.
* **Comparison to Expectations:**  No expectations data is provided, so comparisons to them cannot be made.

**Summary of Earnings:**  Without expectations data, a comprehensive earnings analysis cannot be completed.  The provided data suggests moderate revenue and earnings figures with no clear upward or downward trend.

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, while profit margin shows a slight upward trend over the past four quarters, reaching 33.98% in 2024-Q3.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown growth, but ROE has been volatile, suggesting fluctuating profitability.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

APD currently underperforms the S&P 500 significantly, trading below its key moving averages. Although technical indicators suggest an oversold condition (RSI), the negative PPO and decreasing relative strength signal bearish momentum. Financial data reveals some positive trends (profit margins), but volatile ROE necessitates further investigation.  The lack of news and analyst opinions limits a comprehensive assessment. The projected long-term outperformance of 2.2% over the S&P 500 seems optimistic considering the current negative trends.  More information is needed, specifically regarding market expectations for earnings and recent news, to form a definitive investment recommendation.
