**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** $254.71
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: $254.93, Previous Close: $253.15, Change: $0.7
*   **5-day Moving Average:** $254.54
*   **20-day Moving Average:** $264.05
*   **60-day Moving Average:** $281.55

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The recent price increase ($0.7 change) is relatively small and doesn't necessarily signal a major reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 28.43 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.2537
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (327 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -3.2 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2729.8 (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**  The RSI indicates the stock is currently oversold, which could suggest a potential for a rebound. However, the negative PPO and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence confirm the short-term downward momentum.  The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, but this should be considered alongside other indicators, especially given the significant underperformance and negative expected return. The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, but the MRI value is high and the expected return is very negative, indicating that caution is warranted. The change of $0.7 is not significant enough to drastically alter this analysis.
