**Recommendations:**

- **Short-term:** Given the overbought conditions and potential for short-term correction, investors should consider a cautious approach and wait for a pullback before entering a position.
- **Long-term:** With a strong track record of profitability, consistent revenue growth, and a high expected return, APD remains a compelling investment for long-term investors seeking exposure to the industrial gas sector.
