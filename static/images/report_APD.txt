**Note:** The most recent earnings report (2024-08-01) shows a beat on both EPS and revenue.  It's crucial to compare this to the analysts' estimates for the quarter to understand if the performance was in line with expectations. This information is missing and requires further investigation.

**Overall Analysis:**

APD has underperformed the S&P 500 over the period under review. Despite this, the recent price movement suggests a potential short-term uptrend, while technical indicators suggest that the stock might be due for a correction. The company's most recent earnings report showed a beat on both EPS and revenue, but further analysis is needed to assess if this was in line with analysts' expectations. The high expected return, however, suggests a potentially strong long-term outlook.
