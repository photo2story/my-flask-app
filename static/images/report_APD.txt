### 5. Recent Earnings Analysis

| 날짜        | EPS   | 매출      |
|-------------|-------|-----------|
| 2025-07-31  | 3.2   | 3.02 B$   |
| 2025-05-01  | -7.77 | 2.92 B$   |

| 2025-07-31  | 3.13  | 2.99 B$   |

**Analysis:**  The EPS data is concerning due to the significant negative EPS in one quarter (2025-05-01). While other quarters show positive EPS, the volatility is a red flag. Revenue is relatively stable but not showing significant growth. The repeated entry for '2025-07-31' is likely a data error.

### 7. Overall Analysis

Air Products and Chemicals (APD) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Negative Performance:** APD is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, and its relative underperformance is near its historical worst.
*   **Downtrend:** The stock is in a short-term and medium-term downtrend, trading below its moving averages.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Despite the recent struggles, analysts remain generally positive, with a consensus "Buy" rating and higher price targets.
*   **Financial Concerns:** The negative EPS and ROE in recent quarters are significant red flags, suggesting potential underlying issues.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators provide mixed signals. RSI is nearing oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity, but the PPO confirms the downtrend.
*   **Conflicting expected return:** The expected return of -1660.8% is inconsistent with analyst ratings. One of them are likely flawed.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is cautious.

**Conclusion:**

While analysts are optimistic, the recent financial performance, particularly the negative EPS and ROE, raises concerns. The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the downtrend in the stock price warrant caution. A deeper dive into the reasons behind the negative financial figures is necessary before considering an investment. The extremely negative expected return needs to be verified and understood.
