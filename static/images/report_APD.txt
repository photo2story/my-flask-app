The company's financial data is incomplete, hindering a comprehensive assessment.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-02-06 | $2.77  | $2.93 Billion |

There's some fluctuation in EPS and revenue, with no clear upward or downward trend readily apparent from this limited data.  More data is needed for a conclusive analysis.  The repetition of the 2025-02-06 data point suggests an error in the provided dataset.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data severely limits any meaningful financial analysis.  Key financial ratios and metrics cannot be calculated without this critical information.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

APD's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently,  with technical indicators suggesting a bearish short-term outlook.  The limited financial data provided prevents a thorough fundamental analysis. The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises concerns about long-term investment prospects.  More complete and accurate financial data, alongside a longer historical performance analysis, is necessary for a more robust and reliable investment assessment.  The inconsistencies in the provided data (repeated earnings data) further highlight the need for a more comprehensive dataset.
