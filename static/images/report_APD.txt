| 2023-2025  | -68.0%  | 74.8% | -133.0% | 2.3   | 54.7   |

*   **CAGR:** Shows a declining trend in recent years. The recent negative CAGR values are a major concern.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating significant potential for loss.
*   **Alpha:**  Generally decreasing and significantly negative in recent periods, meaning APD has been underperforming compared to what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:**  Increasing, suggesting APD's volatility relative to the market is rising.  The latest Beta of 2.3 is very high, indicating the stock is much more volatile than the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 239.96
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 245.84, Previous Close: 244.77, Change: 0.44
*   **5-day SMA:** 243.47
*   **20-day SMA:** 250.079
*   **60-day SMA:** 254.9732

**Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a downtrend. The 5-day SMA being below the 20-day SMA and the 20-day SMA being below the 60-day SMA further confirms this downtrend. The small positive change in the "last market" data does not yet reverse the trend.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 35.38
*   **PPO:** -0.237
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1444.7%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Indicates a moderate level of risk, suggesting caution.
*   **RSI:**  At 35.38, the RSI is approaching oversold territory (below 30), which could indicate a potential buying opportunity, but this should be confirmed with other indicators.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The provided hybrid signal suggests a buy recommendation.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** Confirms recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-1444.7%) is a major red flag. It suggests a significant projected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if held long-term.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Voya Investment Management LLC Sold APD Shares:** This indicates institutional selling pressure.
*   **Bernstein Reiterates Outperform:**  This is a positive counterpoint, suggesting at least one analyst believes in the company's future. However, it's important to consider this in light of other negative news.
*   **What's Next With APD Stock After A 25% Drop?:**  Highlights the recent price decline and suggests uncertainty.
*   **$APD stock is down 10% today:**  Confirms recent negative price movement.
*   **Air Products and Chemicals (APD): Assessing Valuation After Recent Share Price Weakness:** Indicates the stock is being re-evaluated due to its poor performance.
*   **Air Products (APD) Stock Hits 52‑Week Low After Yara Hydrogen Deal:** Suggests a negative market reaction to a specific deal.

**Analysis:** The recent news is largely negative, with reports of share price drops, institutional selling, and re-evaluations due to poor performance. The Bernstein "outperform" rating is a positive, but needs to be considered alongside the prevailing negative sentiment.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 2.13 (Buy)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 21
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 292.86 / 340.00 / 245.00

**Analysis:** Despite the current poor performance, the analyst consensus is still a "Buy" with a mean rating of 2.13. The average target price of $292.86 suggests significant upside potential if the analysts' predictions are correct. However, the low target price of $245 is very close to the current price, so analysts are not unanimously confident in the stock. It is crucial to examine the reasoning behind these ratings and target prices in light of the negative news and performance data.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-07-31 | 3.2    | 3.02 B$      |
| 2025-05-01 | -7.77  | 2.92 B$      |
| 2025-02-06 | 2.77   | 2.93 B$      |
| 2024-08-01 | 3.13   | 2.99 B$      |
| 2025-07-31 | 3.13   | 2.99 B$      |

**Analysis:** The earnings data shows a concerning picture. The negative EPS in 2025-05-01 is a significant red flag. While other quarters have positive EPS, the inconsistency and the presence of a large loss are worrying. Revenue appears relatively stable, but not growing significantly.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $3.17B  | 32.25%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $3.02B  | 32.51%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $2.92B  | 29.57%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE     |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| 2025-09-30 | $15.02B   | 0.03%   |
| 2025-06-30 | $15.54B   | 4.59%   |
| 2025-03-31 | $14.70B   | -11.77%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $16.69B   | 3.70%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $17.04B   | 11.45%  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Relatively stable, with some fluctuations.
*   **Profit Margin:** Appears healthy, generally above 30%, but has seen some recent declines.
*   **Equity:** Decreasing trend.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** Highly volatile and concerning. The negative ROE in 2025-03-31 and near-zero ROE in 2025-09-30 indicate significant problems in generating returns for shareholders. The decreasing equity and volatile ROE are strong indicators of financial distress.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

APD is currently exhibiting several concerning trends:

*   **Significant Underperformance:**  The stock is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, with a large and unfavorable divergence.
*   **Downtrend:** The stock price is below its moving averages, confirming a downtrend.
*   **Negative News & Sentiment:** Recent news is predominantly negative, with reports of price drops, institutional selling, and valuation concerns.
*   **Weak Financials:** The company's recent earnings and financial data show a concerning picture, including a loss in one quarter and volatile, low, or negative ROE, as well as a decreasing equity balance.
*   **High Volatility:** The beta is increasing to a very high level.

**Conclusion:**

While analysts maintain a "Buy" rating, the data paints a cautionary picture. The negative trends in performance, financial data, and market sentiment suggest that the "Buy" rating should be viewed with considerable skepticism. A much deeper dive into the underlying reasons for the poor performance, the potential for a turnaround, and the validity of the analysts' optimistic outlook is strongly recommended before making any investment decision. The very negative expected return should be a major cause for concern. Given all the factors, a "Sell" rating or at least a "Hold" is more appropriate.
