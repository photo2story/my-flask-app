**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis):**

APD is currently exhibiting several concerning trends:

*   **Negative Financial Trends:** Declining CAGR, negative Alpha, and volatile ROE suggest fundamental problems.
*   **Weak Price Action:** The stock is in a short-term downtrend.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** While the MRI suggests high investment potential and analysts have a "Buy" rating, these contradict the negative financial data and performance. The Hybrid Signal is suggesting an aggressive buy based on the oversold condition and high MRI, this should be carefully considered.
*   **Key Concern:** The large negative Expected Return is a major red flag, indicating potentially significant long-term underperformance.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, investing in APD at this time appears risky. While the oversold RSI and analyst ratings might tempt some investors, the negative financial trends, significant underperformance, and extremely negative expected return warrant extreme caution.  Further research is needed to understand the reasons for the underperformance and the likelihood of a turnaround. Investors should carefully weigh the risks before considering a position in APD.
