## General Electric Co. (GE) Stock Analysis Report

**Summary:** This report analyzes General Electric Co., a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors including aviation, power, and healthcare.  The analysis incorporates cumulative return, Alpha/Beta metrics, recent price movements, and technical indicators (RSI, PPO) to assess the stock's performance and potential.

**1. Cumulative Return and Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

GE's cumulative return is 94.33%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 78.93% return. The difference is 15.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence indicator places this outperformance at the 91.1 percentile compared to historical data. While this indicates strong relative performance, it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance over different periods. While recent years (2022-2025) exhibit high CAGR and a positive Alpha, suggesting outperformance, earlier periods show significantly negative returns and negative Alphas, indicating underperformance relative to the market.  The Beta values fluctuate widely, indicating varying levels of market sensitivity across different time frames. High Beta values suggest higher volatility correlated with the market.  Capitalization (Cap) has seen considerable increase over the period, indicating growth in market value.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $193.68
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $185.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $187.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $197.47

The closing price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent upward trend potentially losing momentum.  The price change of $2.38 from the previous close shows a recent price increase. This warrants monitoring for confirmation of a sustained upward or downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.49 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** 0.56 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +1.8 (Indicates short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -11.5% (This suggests a negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over a longer-term horizon.  This needs further clarification; this metric requires context on how it was calculated).


**Overall Assessment:**

GE has shown periods of strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500, reflected in the high cumulative return. However, the historical volatility and inconsistent Alpha values highlight significant risk. Recent price action suggests potential upward momentum, but the price is below the 60-day moving average, indicating caution. The technical indicators present a mixed signal: while PPO suggests bullishness, RSI is nearing oversold levels.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term requires further investigation into its calculation methodology and underlying assumptions.  A deeper dive into fundamental analysis is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high Beta values across various periods suggest caution for risk-averse investors.
