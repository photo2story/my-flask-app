**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2025-02-03 | 1.76 | 9.88 B$      |

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of total revenue and gross profit data significantly limits the financial analysis. Key financial ratios and metrics cannot be calculated without this crucial information.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE has shown impressive outperformance against the S&P 500 historically, with a remarkably high relative divergence. However, current technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest caution. The overbought RSI and negative PPO indicate potential for a price correction.  The inconsistent earnings data and lack of key financial information prevent a comprehensive assessment.  Further investigation, including a review of the company's financial statements and industry outlook, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is projected to be negative, potentially indicating a riskier investment despite its recent strong performance.
