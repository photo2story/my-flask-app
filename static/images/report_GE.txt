## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

General Electric Co (GE) is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors, including aviation, healthcare, and power.

The cumulative return of GE is 148.24%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.39%.  The difference is 29.8%, placing it at the 77.3rd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  While this indicates strong relative performance, the historical volatility (max 70.5%, min -108.7%) highlights the risk associated with GE's stock.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in GE's performance over different periods. While recent years (2021-2024) have shown impressive growth, earlier periods experienced substantial losses.  The consistently low alpha (around 0.2) suggests that GE's returns have largely tracked the market, with only modest outperformance. The high beta (ranging from 38 to 184) indicates significant sensitivity to market movements.  This high beta reflects the inherent risk in GEâ€™s diverse business portfolio.
