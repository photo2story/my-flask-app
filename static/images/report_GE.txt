The table below shows CAGR, maximum drawdown (MDD), alpha, beta, and market capitalization over different periods:

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | -32.0% | 16.6%  | -0.0  | 85.9  |        |
| 2016-2018  | -73.0% | 52.0%  | -0.0  | 38.3  |        |
| 2017-2019  | -38.0% | 52.0%  | -0.0  | 59.0  |        |
| 2018-2020  | 15.0%  | 52.0%  | -0.1  | 57.4  |        |
| 2019-2021  | 34.0%  | 33.5%  | -0.1  | 62.9  |        |
| 2020-2022  | 5.0%   | 58.6%  | -0.2  | 56.0  |        |
| 2021-2023  | 80.0%  | 58.6%  | -1.4  | 109.7 |        |
| 2022-2024  | 147.0% | 58.6%  | -0.5  | 180.8 |        |
| 2023-2025  | 157.0% | 54.6%  | 0.9   | 217.3 |        |

The high beta values indicate GE's price movements are significantly more volatile than the market.  The negative alpha values in several periods suggest underperformance relative to the market, adjusted for risk, while the positive alpha in 2023-2025 suggests recent outperformance.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 200.15
* **Last Market Price:** 203.84 (1.84 increase from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** 205.08
* **20-day Moving Average:** 200.51
* **60-day Moving Average:** 196.48

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting some near-term downward pressure, but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend. The recent price increase of 1.84 might indicate a short-term upward momentum.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 59.61 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.06 (Slightly negative; suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -8.1% (This is a negative long term expected return compared to S&P 500)

The recent price increase ('change': 1.84) is relatively small and doesn't indicate a significant upward surge (not a "rapid upswing").  The negative expected return needs further investigation. The combination of indicators suggests a mixed signal.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-02-03 | 1.76 | $9.88B        |
| 2024-10-22 | 1.71 | $8.94B        |
| 2025-02-03 | 1.71 | $8.94B        |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.16 | $8.22B        |
| 2025-02-03 | 1.16 | $8.22B        |

There's a duplication of data points in this table.  A clear trend in EPS and revenue is difficult to ascertain due to the duplicate data and limited timeframe.  More complete data is required for a robust analysis.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $10.81B     | 37.45%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $9.84B      | 36.74%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $9.09B      | 38.69%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $16.05B     | 27.61%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $19.42B     | 25.88%        |

Revenue shows some volatility. Profit margins are generally high, but decreased in the last two quarters of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE           |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $19.34B     | 9.82%         |
| 2024-09-30  | $18.87B     | 9.81%         |
| 2024-06-30  | $18.60B     | 6.81%         |
| 2024-03-31  | $29.86B     | 5.15%         |
| 2023-12-31  | $27.40B     | 5.81%         |

Equity and ROE show volatility, suggesting potential fluctuations in profitability and capital structure.  The significant drop in equity and ROE in Q2 and Q1 2024 needs investigation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

GE has demonstrated strong cumulative returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500 in recent years, indicated by a high relative divergence. However,  this outperformance is characterized by significant volatility (high beta) and periods of negative alpha, suggesting that this superior performance may not be entirely due to skill and is partially influenced by luck and higher risk-taking.  The recent earnings data is incomplete and requires clarification. Technical indicators present a mixed signal.  The negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 raises serious concern.  A thorough review of the underlying reasons for the recent high returns and a more comprehensive analysis of the financial statements are needed before drawing definitive conclusions about the future prospects of GE.  The high volatility necessitates a cautious approach.
