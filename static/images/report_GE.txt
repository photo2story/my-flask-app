**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

GE's cumulative return (113.09%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's return (87.98%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 25.1%, placing it at the 98.2nd percentile of the historical divergence range (max: 27.6%, min: -110.2%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a mixed performance regarding alpha (excess return compared to the market) and beta (volatility relative to the market).  While recent years (2022-2025) show a high CAGR and positive alpha, indicating outperformance, earlier years demonstrate negative alpha and high volatility (high beta). This volatility is evident in the significant Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) also shows significant growth.  A deeper dive into the underlying factors driving these fluctuations is needed for a complete understanding.  The significant shift in alpha from negative to positive in recent periods warrants further investigation.


| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|

| 2018-2020  | 26.0%  | 62.7%  | -4.0%  | -0.4  | 56.5   |
| 2019-2021  | 27.0%  | 59.3%  | -34.0% | -0.4  | 61.9   |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 214.49
* **Last Market Price:** 214.96 (a 0.22 increase from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 209.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 195.615
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 197.7538

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish trend.  The relatively small increase in the last market price compared to the higher moving averages suggests this isn't necessarily a rapid uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3707 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 89.89 (Extremely overbought, indicating potential for a near-term correction)
* **PPO:** 1.2488 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence:** 6.3 (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.

The high RSI value (89.89) is a significant warning sign, suggesting the stock is significantly overbought and prone to a potential price correction.  Despite the positive PPO and short-term upward divergence, the extremely high RSI significantly outweighs those positive signals.

The slight price increase of 0.22 does not indicate a significant rapid movement.  The negative expected return of -9.3% needs further clarification.  The statement "long-term (2+ years) investment" suggests that despite the current overbought condition, a longer-term perspective is considered.  This potential future S&P 500 outperformance needs to be supported by a deeper analysis of the company's fundamentals and future prospects, particularly in relation to the risks currently highlighted by the RSI.
