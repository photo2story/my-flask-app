## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Report

**0. Overview:** General Electric Co is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors including aviation, healthcare, and renewable energy.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

GE's cumulative return (90.74%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (76.08%) by 14.7 percentage points.  The relative divergence (90.6%) indicates that GE's performance is in the upper 90th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 over the observed period.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results.  While recent years (2022-2025) show high CAGR and positive alpha, suggesting outperformance, earlier periods demonstrate negative alpha and significant maximum drawdowns (MDD). The high beta values (mostly above 50) consistently indicate high sensitivity to market movements.  This volatility needs careful consideration.  Capitalization (Cap) has shown significant growth over the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $182.45
* **Previous Close:** $185.67
* **Change:** -$1.73 (a -0.93% decrease)  This indicates a recent slight downward trend.
* **5-day Moving Average:** $183.46
* **20-day Moving Average:** $192.17
* **60-day Moving Average:** $198.07

The price is below all three moving averages, further suggesting a bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4118 (Medium Risk).  This suggests moderate risk associated with GE stock.
* **RSI:** 35.56. This value is below 40, indicating the stock is potentially oversold.
* **PPO:** -0.285. A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.6.  This signifies a recent short-term upward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** -11.7%. This suggests a negative expected return at the current juncture.  However, the long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not explicitly stated and requires further analysis. The provided data shows that GE significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period, which contradicts the negative expected return. Clarification is needed on the -11.7% figure, and how it relates to the historical data and the significantly better cumulative return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistency, with duplicate entries for February 3rd, 2025 and July 23rd, 2024.  Assuming these are errors and using unique entries, we see a general upward trend in both EPS and revenue. However, a more detailed analysis requires understanding the fiscal quarters. The data suggests strong, albeit inconsistent, earnings growth.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some volatility, with a significant spike in Q1 2024.  Profit margins are generally healthy (30%-40%), but also show volatility, dropping significantly in Q1 2024 and Q4 2023.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows significant fluctuations, and ROE is also inconsistent, suggesting potential underlying business changes or accounting adjustments impacting financial performance.


**6.  Overall Analysis:**

GE's stock has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the past years, as evidenced by its high cumulative return and positive alpha in recent periods. However, the high beta indicates significant market sensitivity, and the negative expected return at the current moment, along with the negative PPO and low RSI, suggests a potential short-term bearish trend.  The volatility in financial statements (revenue, profit margin, equity, and ROE) further highlights risk and requires more detailed analysis to understand underlying causes.  Long-term investment potential hinges on addressing the inconsistent financial performance and the resolution of the discrepancy between historical outperformance and the currently indicated -11.7% expected return.  Further research into the reasons for past performance, current market conditions, and future growth prospects is crucial before making any investment decision.
