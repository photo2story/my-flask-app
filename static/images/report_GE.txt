    *   **Negative Alpha (most periods before 2022):**  Indicates underperformance relative to what would be expected based on its beta.
    *   **Variable Beta:** GE's beta fluctuates, sometimes close to zero or even negative. This suggests that GE's price movements haven't consistently mirrored the overall market.
    *   **CAGR Fluctuations:**  CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies widely, reflecting GE's volatile performance during the periods analyzed.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Consistent high MDD indicates significant risk.

*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Negative Expected Return:** The -8.9% expected return needs further investigation. What factors are driving this negative outlook?

    *   **Valuation Concerns:**  Address the analyst's valuation concerns. Is GE currently overvalued?

Investors should thoroughly investigate the reasons behind the negative expected return, understand the specific dynamics of GE Vernova and GE Aerospace, and carefully consider the valuation concerns before making investment decisions. While analyst opinions are positive, the MRI (Medium Investment) and the Hybrid Signal's caution flag suggest that risk remains.
