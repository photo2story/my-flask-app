**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

General Electric Co is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors.  The provided data shows a significant outperformance of GE compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Further analysis will delve into the drivers of this performance.


**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **GE Cumulative Return:** 195.64%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 119.91%
* **Return Difference:** 75.7%
* **Relative Divergence:** 99.0% (Indicates GE's performance is at the 99th percentile relative to its historical divergence from the S&P 500.)

The table shows GE significantly outperformed the S&P 500, particularly in recent years (2021-2025).  However, high beta values in earlier periods (indicating higher volatility than the market) highlight periods of substantial risk. The alpha values show periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market, fluctuating substantially over the time period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $203.57
* **Last Market Price:** $203.55
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $199.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $184.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $177.93

The price is slightly below the previous close, suggesting a minor downward trend. However, it sits above all three moving averages, indicating upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 81.91 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 1.18 (Positive value indicates bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +2.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -11.0% (This suggests an expected underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, despite the current strong performance.)  This needs further investigation to determine the underlying assumptions. The negative return needs more context to be meaningful.

The relatively small recent price change does not indicate a significant event (no sharp up or down movement).  The overbought RSI suggests caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-02-03 | 1.76 | $9.88B      |

| 2025-02-03 | 1.16 | $8.22B      |


There are duplicate entries in this data.  The data suggests some volatility in EPS and revenue, potentially requiring further investigation into the underlying business factors.  Consistency in data reporting is important for a robust analysis.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE's recent performance significantly outperformed the S&P 500, reflected in its high cumulative return and relative divergence.  However, this outperformance is accompanied by high volatility (beta) in some periods and an overbought RSI, suggesting potential for a correction.  The provided long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500.  Earnings data needs clarification due to inconsistencies. While financial information reveals healthy margins generally, more in-depth analysis is needed to assess the sustainability of this performance and the drivers of profitability and ROE volatility. A complete analysis would require a deeper dive into the company's financial statements, industry trends, and future outlook.  The currently provided data presents a mixed picture, highlighting both significant successes and potential risks.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence is crucial.
