## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

General Electric Co (GE) is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors, including aviation, healthcare, and power.  The provided data shows GE's cumulative return significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) as of the last data point.  GE's cumulative return is 145.35%, while VOO's is 115.96%.  This represents a difference of 29.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence indicator (77.1) suggests this outperformance is in the upper range of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this should be considered in the context of the significant historical volatility shown in the CAGR and MDD data.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values suggest GE's performance has been inconsistent relative to the market.  While recent years (2021-2024) show significant outperformance (high CAGR and positive alpha), earlier periods reflect considerable underperformance (negative CAGR and substantial Maximum Drawdowns (MDD)).  The beta values fluctuate widely, indicating varying sensitivities to market movements over time.  The consistently low alpha values suggest that the outperformance in recent periods might not solely be attributed to superior stock picking, but also reflects broader market factors and sector-specific conditions.  More data is needed to determine long-term trend.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

GE's recent performance has been strong, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, its historical performance shows high volatility and periods of substantial underperformance.  The positive momentum indicated by the PPO and recent relative divergence change needs to be considered in light of the price being below its moving averages, suggesting a possible near-term correction.  The financial data shows fluctuating revenue and profitability, highlighting the need for deeper analysis of the underlying business factors.  A thorough review of recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 (-21.1%) raises concerns, which requires more in-depth analysis.  The high volatility and inconsistent performance of GE necessitates a cautious approach, perhaps involving diversification within a broader investment portfolio.
