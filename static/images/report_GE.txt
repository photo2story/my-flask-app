**5. Overall Analysis:**

GE's stock performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500, showing a cumulative return difference of 98.09%. This outperformance is further evidenced by the relatively high relative divergence of 90.18%. Despite this, current technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, with the RSI indicating an oversold condition and the PPO suggesting a potential price decline. The negative delta_previous_relative_divergence reinforces this short-term downward trend. The absence of earnings data makes it difficult to assess the current earnings and outlook. However, the expected return of 11.41% over a 5-year horizon suggests potential for long-term growth.

**6. Investment Recommendation:**

Given the current bearish technical indicators and lack of earnings data, investors should exercise caution and closely monitor future earnings reports and technical signals before making any investment decisions. While the stock has shown strong historical outperformance, the current market conditions may present challenges for short-term growth.  However, the long-term expected return remains positive, indicating potential for future growth.
