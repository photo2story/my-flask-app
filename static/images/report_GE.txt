*   **Analysis:** Analyst consensus is generally positive with a "Buy" rating and an average price target significantly above the current price.

Recent positive news articles highlight the stock's potential after its spin-off and the growth prospects within its aerospace focus.

Technical indicators like PPO point to some short-term weakness.

*   **Considerations:**
    *   **Risk Tolerance:** Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance, given the high MDD.
