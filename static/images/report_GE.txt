**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data is inconsistent, with duplicate entries.  A clearer presentation is needed for meaningful analysis.  Without consistent data, it is not possible to determine revenue trends, profit growth or any consistent EPS pattern.


| Date       | EPS | Revenue      |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2025-02-03 | 1.76 | $9.88B       |
| 2024-10-22 | 1.71 | $8.94B       |
| 2025-02-03 | 1.71 | $8.94B       |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.16 | $8.22B       |
| 2025-02-03 | 1.16 | $8.22B       |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows some volatility in revenue and profitability.  Profit margins are generally high, but revenue experienced a large decrease from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024.  Equity also experienced a considerable decrease in Q1 2024. ROE (Return on Equity) appears relatively stable, though somewhat low.  A deeper dive into the underlying causes of these fluctuations is necessary.

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.81B | 37.45% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.84B  | 36.74% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.09B  | 38.69% |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.05B | 27.61% |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.42B | 25.88% |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $19.34B | 9.82% |
| 2024-09-30 | $18.87B | 9.81% |
| 2024-06-30 | $18.60B | 6.81% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE has shown strong cumulative returns exceeding the S&P 500, particularly over recent periods.  However, significant volatility exists.  The recent price action indicates short-term weakness, while longer-term indicators (e.g. the high relative divergence, the CAGR over 2023-2025) are more positive.  Inconsistencies in the earnings data and fluctuations in profitability need further investigation. Before making any investment decisions, a more comprehensive analysis, including a review of the company's strategic direction, competitive landscape, and valuation, is crucial.  The provided -12% expected return compared to S&P 500 over 2+ years requires further validation.  The data suggests a high-risk, high-reward scenario.
