Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of General Electric Co. (GE) based on the provided data:

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** General Electric Co (GE) is a high-tech industrial company.
*   **GE Cumulative Return:** 122.14%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 105.07%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 17.1
    *   Relative Divergence: 86.4

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, and Other Metrics:**

The table provides a historical view of GE's performance compared to the market (S&P 500). Here's a breakdown:

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Notice the dramatic shift in CAGR from negative values in the 2016-2022 periods to extremely high positive values recently. This indicates a significant turnaround in GE's performance in recent years.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD remains relatively high, indicating significant potential for losses during downturns, though it has slightly decreased.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the investment's performance on a risk-adjusted basis. The negative Alpha from 2016-2022 shows GE underperformed the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis. However, the substantial positive Alpha in recent periods (especially the last three periods) shows significant outperformance, indicating GE is generating returns above what's expected for the level of risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. Beta values around 1 indicate GE's price moves roughly in line with the S&P 500. Fluctuations around 1 (e.g., 0.9, 1.2) suggest it's neither significantly more nor less volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Cap in Billions):** Shows a substantial increase in market capitalization, reflecting investor confidence and the company's improving performance.

**In summary:** This historical data suggests GE underwent a period of significant underperformance followed by a strong turnaround and recent outperformance compared to the broader market.

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment Recommended" level of risk.
