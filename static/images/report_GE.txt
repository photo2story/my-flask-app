## General Electric Co. (GE) Stock Review

**Executive Summary:** General Electric Co. is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors.  This report analyzes GE's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), evaluating key financial metrics, and providing an outlook.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

GE's cumulative return of 86.97% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return of 66.94% over the analyzed period.  The difference of 20.03% places GE in the 89.3rd percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, indicating strong relative performance.  However,  the provided alpha and beta values exhibit inconsistent performance relative to the market. While recent years show a positive alpha and high CAGR, earlier years reflect negative alphas and substantial Maximum Drawdowns (MDDs), highlighting GE's volatility and risk. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows significant growth over the analyzed periods.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -30.0% | 56.3% | -59.0% | 0.1 | 84.3 |
| 2016-2018  | -62.0% | 62.9% | -80.0% | -0.0 | 37.6 |
| 2017-2019  | -26.0% | 62.9% | -55.0% | -0.3 | 57.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 26.0% | 62.9% | 1.0% | -0.3 | 56.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 27.0% | 59.2% | -28.0% | -0.3 | 61.8 |
| 2020-2022  | 1.0% | 75.1% | -5.0% | -0.4 | 55.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 51.0% | 75.1% | 34.0% | -0.5 | 107.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 75.0% | 75.1% | 58.0% | -1.0 | 177.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $187.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $175.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $196.20
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $197.87

The price is currently below its 20 and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The significant one-day price change of $10.57 (from $169.37 to $187.27) reflects a sharp recent price increase, indicating a potential period of high volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 39.82 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -1.66 (Bearish signal)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.0 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -10.1% (long-term negative expected return relative to S&P 500)

The high MRI, low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence change suggest a bearish outlook in the short term.  The significant one-day price jump needs further analysis to determine if it's sustainable.  The negative expected return indicates that the long-term (2+ years) return is predicted to be lower than the S&P 500.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

GE's recent performance has been strong relative to the S&P 500, displaying high cumulative returns. However, the historical data reveals significant volatility and periods of substantial underperformance. The short-term outlook appears bearish based on technical indicators, although the recent price surge indicates potential short-term bullish pressure. Long-term investment decisions should carefully consider the historical volatility, inconsistent alpha and beta values, and the relatively negative long-term expected return versus the S&P 500.  A thorough review of the inconsistent earnings data and a deeper dive into the reasons for the equity drop in Q1 2024 are crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further analysis of the company's strategic direction and industry trends is recommended.
