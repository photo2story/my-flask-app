*   **CAGR:**  Varies significantly across periods, demonstrating GE's volatile performance. The recent period (2023-2025) shows very strong growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Consistently high drawdowns indicate significant risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is positive in recent periods (2018-2020, 2021-2023, 2022-2024, 2023-2025), indicating outperformance relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark.  However, earlier periods show negative alpha.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values vary. Recent Beta (2.4) indicates high sensitivity to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization increases over the period. Especially, the recent capitalization surge suggests growing investor confidence or significant market re-evaluation.

**2.4. Recent Price Action**

The current price of 297.0 is below the 5-day moving average (299.04) but above the 20-day (292.81) and 60-day (277.52) moving averages. The slight decrease in price from the previous close (299.45) with a change of -0.82 suggests a minor pullback.

**2.5. Market Risk Indicator and Technical Indicators**

The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.9 suggests a "High Investment Recommended" rating. The RSI of 63.72 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70). The PPO of -0.18 indicates that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, suggesting a neutral to slightly bearish trend. The Hybrid Signal recommends a "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" strategy, which aligns with the high MRI score.

**2.6. Recent Divergence Change and Expected Return**

The recent (20-day) relative divergence change of -1.2 suggests a short-term decline in relative performance compared to the S&P 500. The expected return of -8.2% versus the S&P 500 over the long term is a concerning factor, suggesting underperformance in the future.

**2.7. Recent News & Significant Events**

The recent news headlines paint a mixed picture:

*   **Positive:** GE Aerospace's Q3 2025 earnings are anticipated (Barchart). GE Vernova Inc. (GEV) is attracting investor attention (Zacks). "Here is What to Know Beyond Why GE Aerospace (GE) is a Trending Stock" (Zacks) suggests ongoing positive momentum.
*   **Neutral:** "Breakout Stocks Watch: What Looms For October?" (Investor's Business Daily) mentions GE but doesn't provide specific positive or negative sentiment.
*   **Related/Competitive:** Mentions of Rolls-Royce and Honeywell may provide context for the aerospace industry but aren't directly about GE's performance.

**2.8. Analyst Opinions**

Analyst consensus is strongly bullish, with a mean rating of 1.44 (Strong Buy) based on 14 opinions. The average target price of 305.71 suggests a potential upside from the current price of 297.0.

**3. Summary and Conclusion:**

GE has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent positive news sentiment and strong analyst ratings suggest continued positive momentum. However, potential investors should be aware of the high beta, relatively low "Expected Return", relatively high RSI (approaching overbought conditions), and short-term divergence change that indicates a recent slight underperformance compared to the S&P 500. Also, consider high MDD when you invest in GE.
