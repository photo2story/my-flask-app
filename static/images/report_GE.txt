A comprehensive analysis incorporating a more complete dataset, deeper fundamental analysis, and consideration of broader macroeconomic factors is necessary before forming a conclusive investment opinion.  The high relative divergence is noteworthy but should be interpreted cautiously in light of the historical volatility.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent performance surge is crucial.
