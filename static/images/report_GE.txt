## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Performance Review

**Executive Summary:** General Electric Co is a multinational conglomerate operating in various sectors.  This report analyzes GE's stock performance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), considering its recent price movements, momentum indicators (RSI, PPO), and historical performance data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

GE's cumulative return significantly outperformed the S&P 500, with a return of 195.64% versus 119.91% for VOO.  This represents a difference of 75.7 percentage points, placing it at the 99th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided data range of maximum 77.5% and minimum -108.7% difference).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results across different time periods.  While recent years (2021-2025) show significantly positive alpha (outperformance), earlier periods often showed negative alpha and high beta (meaning higher volatility compared to the market). The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) from 2015 to 2025 also suggests significant growth.  The high beta in earlier periods indicates high sensitivity to market fluctuations, while the decreasing beta in later periods might indicate reduced volatility and a more stable performance relative to the market.  Overall, the analysis points towards strong performance in the most recent years, but volatility and sensitivity to market conditions were characteristics of GE in prior years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

GE's closing price was $203.57.  The stock experienced a slight decrease (-$0.97) from the previous closing price of $205.57.  The short-term trend appears somewhat bearish, given the closing price is below the 5-day ($199.43), 20-day ($184.59), and 60-day ($177.93) moving averages.  However, the price remains above all three averages, suggesting potential support levels.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (81.91):** Indicates the stock is currently in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction or pullback.

* **PPO (1.18):** A positive value suggests upward momentum, although it's not excessively high.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+2.9):**  This positive value indicates a short-term upward trend in the relative strength of GE compared to the S&P 500.

* **Expected Return (-11.0%):**  This implies a negative expected return relative to the benchmark (S&P 500) over the long term (2+ years). However, this is a forecast and its accuracy depends on numerous factors that could influence the stock's trajectory.  The relatively high recent alpha would need to be taken into consideration,  but the negative expected return suggests that long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500 may not be guaranteed.

* **Price Change:** The relatively small price change of -$0.97 does not indicate a significant sudden movement (no sharp upward or downward spike).


**Conclusion:**

GE has demonstrated strong recent performance exceeding that of the S&P 500. However, overbought conditions (RSI), along with a negative long-term expected return, suggest caution.  Investors should carefully consider the historical volatility (high Beta in earlier years), current overbought state (high RSI), and the negative expected return before making investment decisions.  Further analysis, including fundamental factors and market outlook, is recommended.
