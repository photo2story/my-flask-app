## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

GE, a multinational conglomerate operating in various sectors including aviation, healthcare, and power, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  Its cumulative return is substantially higher than VOO's.  However,  the high relative divergence warrants further investigation into the sustainability of this outperformance.


**1. Return Rate Comparison and Divergence:**

* **GE Cumulative Return:** 200.83%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 121.84%
* **Return Difference:** 79.0%  (This indicates GE's return is 79 percentage points higher than VOO's at the last data point).
* **Relative Divergence:** 97.8% (This means GE's outperformance relative to VOO is at the 97.8th percentile of historical divergence, suggesting a significant deviation from historical trends.)


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile alpha and beta values over the years.  Early years (2015-2019) show high negative CAGR and significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) despite relatively high beta, indicative of high risk and underperformance against the market.  Later years (2020-2025) show significantly improved performance, with high positive CAGR and a substantially reduced beta in recent years. The alpha values fluctuation emphasizes the erratic nature of GE's performance in relation to the market.  Noteworthy is the extremely high alpha of 1.2 in 2023-2025, suggesting substantial outperformance during this period.  However, the sustainability of such a high alpha remains questionable.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $208.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $208.06
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $200.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $182.40

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting minor short-term bearish pressure.  However, it is significantly above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a strong upward trend in the medium to long term.  The recent price drop of $0.09 reflects a minor correction after significant upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 76.41 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term correction)
* **PPO:** -0.11 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.2 (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -10.9% (Suggests potential underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, despite recent strong gains.)  This contradicts the significant past outperformance but highlights the risk and volatility associated with the stock.  Recent price movement indicates a short-term correction is possibly underway.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and appears to contain duplicate entries.  A reliable analysis cannot be performed with this dataset.  Consistent and complete data is needed for a proper assessment of revenue and EPS growth trends.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has fluctuated, with a significant drop in Q1 2024 followed by some recovery. Profit margins are generally high, but also show some fluctuations.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows fluctuations and a notable increase in Q1 2024. ROE also fluctuates but shows a trend of improvement toward the end of 2024.  More data is needed for robust analysis of longer-term trends.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE has demonstrated exceptional recent performance, significantly outpacing the S&P 500. However, this outperformance is accompanied by high volatility and substantial risk, as evidenced by the inconsistent alpha and beta values, as well as technical indicators suggesting overbought conditions and potential near-term corrections.  Long-term projections are uncertain, with a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500.  The inconsistent earnings data prevents a thorough assessment of fundamental strength.  Further investigation is needed into the drivers of GE's recent outperformance to determine the sustainability of this trend.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with this stock before making investment decisions.  Thorough due diligence, including examination of complete and reliable financial statements and industry analysis, is crucial.
