## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Report

**Executive Summary:** General Electric Co is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors including aviation, healthcare, and energy.  This report analyzes GE's recent performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering key metrics such as cumulative return, moving averages, and technical indicators.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** GE shows a cumulative return of 97.24%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 82.57% return.  The difference is 14.7%, placing it in the 90.6th percentile of historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided range (-110.2% to 27.6%).

* **Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data reveals inconsistent alpha and beta values across different periods.  While recent years (2022-2025) show positive alpha (1.1), indicating outperformance, earlier years demonstrate negative alpha, suggesting underperformance relative to the market.  The high beta values consistently suggest GE is more volatile than the overall market.  The significant fluctuation in beta throughout the years likely reflect changes in the companyâ€™s overall market risk exposure.  Capitalization (Cap(B)) shows a marked increase over the analyzed period, indicating growth in company size.

* **CAGR and MDD:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) data showcases significant volatility in GE's performance over the years, with negative CAGRs and substantial MDDs observed in several periods before recovering recent years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $197.41
* **Last Market Close:** $207.7 (a $2.01 increase from the previous close of $203.61). This represents a recent price jump.
* **Moving Averages:**
    * 5-day MA: $188.08
    * 20-day MA: $187.30
    * 60-day MA: $197.52

The recent price ($207.7) is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend, although the price is still near the 60-day MA. The recent jump should be considered in the analysis.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 indicates a medium risk level.
* **RSI:** 56.25 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, implying neutral momentum.
* **PPO:** 0.93 indicates a bullish signal, as a positive value generally suggests upward momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** 0.0 indicates no significant change in the recent relative strength, although this needs further context to interpret (data like the exact timeframe of this relative strength analysis is needed).
* **Expected Return:** -11.6% suggests that, based on the provided data and potentially considering the overall market conditions, the projected return might be lower than the expected market return within the next two years. However, the negative expected return may need more details to be more reliable.  This is a projection, and actual results may vary.

**Conclusion:**

GE's recent performance has outperformed the S&P 500, showcasing a higher cumulative return.  However, the historical volatility and inconsistent alpha/beta values highlight considerable risk. The recent price increase needs to be observed carefully for any underlying event. While technical indicators suggest a relatively neutral to bullish outlook, the negative expected return warrants caution. A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) might be considered, keeping the inherent volatility of GE in mind.  Further investigation into the drivers of the recent price jump is recommended.
