**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE has shown remarkable recent outperformance against the S&P 500, with a considerably higher cumulative return. However, its historical performance has been volatile, exhibiting periods of significant negative returns.  The high beta indicates sensitivity to market fluctuations. While recent financial data suggests relatively healthy profit margins, the expected return of -18% over the long term is a significant concern that needs further investigation.   The current technical indicators present a mixed picture, neither clearly bullish nor bearish.  A detailed review of recent news, including earnings reports and analyst opinions, is crucial to fully assess the current situation and future outlook for GE.  The discrepancy between the short-term outperformance and the long-term negative expected return warrants a thorough examination of the factors driving this divergence.  Further analysis of the company's strategic direction, competitive landscape, and potential risks is essential before making any investment decisions.
