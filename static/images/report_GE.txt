**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

General Electric Co (GE) is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors, including aviation, healthcare, and power.

The cumulative return of GE is 146.27%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.56%. The difference is 28.7%, placing it in the 76.6th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on provided max and min values).  While this indicates strong relative performance, the provided historical data show significant volatility, with periods of substantial underperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data reveals high beta values (generally above 50) across most periods, suggesting GE's returns are highly correlated with and amplified by the overall market.  The consistently low alpha values (around 0.2) indicate that GE has not consistently outperformed the market after adjusting for risk (beta).  This is notable given the recent strong relative performance.  The high beta in recent years(110,183) is worth investigating further.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

GE has shown strong recent relative performance compared to the S&P 500, with a considerable difference in cumulative returns. However, historical data reveals high volatility and consistent low alpha, suggesting that its high returns may be driven by market correlation rather than superior management.  Recent technical indicators point to potential downward pressure, and financial data show fluctuations in both revenue and equity.

The expected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 warrants consideration.
