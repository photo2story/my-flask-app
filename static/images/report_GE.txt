**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is approaching oversold levels, which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity, though it's not a guarantee. The negative PPO and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence support the possibility of a short-term downward trend.  The negative expected return suggests caution regarding long-term investment, relative to the S&P 500. The hybrid signal recommends a buy, but this should be considered in light of the other indicators. Since, the `change` is not particularly large, no rapid increase/decrease consideration is needed.
