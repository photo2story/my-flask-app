**1. Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** General Electric Co is a global high-tech industrial company, focused on aviation, power, and renewable energy.

Let's break down the Alpha/Beta analysis:

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows significant volatility, ranging from -60% to +123%. The most recent periods (2022-2025) display strong growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates risk. GE's MDD has been relatively high, reflecting its volatile performance (2016-2024).
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the stock's performance relative to the market. Negative Alpha figures in earlier periods (2016-2021) indicate underperformance compared to the market. More recent periods (2021-2025) show positive Alpha, suggesting GE is now generating excess returns.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A Beta around 1 indicates that GE's price tends to move in line with the market. Beta > 1 means it's more volatile than the market. GE's Beta is consistently around 1, which explains similar trends of GE vs S&P500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization, showing the company's growth.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Analysis:** The current price of 320.75 is above all three Simple Moving Averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating an upward trend. The strong price increase from the previous close suggests significant positive momentum.

**3. RSI, PPO & Market Risk Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 73.85 suggests that GE is currently overbought. This could indicate a potential for a price correction in the near term.
*   **PPO:** The PPO of 0.57 indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, confirming the upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends a very bullish strategy with 90% cash allocation to GE, indicating a high degree of confidence based on the model.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** A recent decline in relative divergence (-2.8) suggests a short-term pullback or underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** A negative expected return of -3.3% is concerning and contrasts with the bullish signals from other indicators. It suggests the stock might be overvalued at the current price based on the model's projections.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

GE (General Electric Co) is currently exhibiting a mixed picture:

*   **Positive Momentum:** GE has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 recently, with a strong uptrend in its stock price. Recent news and analyst ratings are largely positive, highlighting the growth potential of the aerospace sector and GE's position within it.
*   **Overbought Condition:** However, the RSI indicates that the stock is overbought, suggesting a possible short-term correction.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** The negative expected return is a concerning signal. This suggests that, despite the positive momentum, the stock might be overvalued based on the model's projections (likely due to factors not fully captured by the news headlines).

**Recommendation:**

The hybrid signal recommends aggressive investment, while negative expected return is a concern.
