## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Report

**0) Overview:** General Electric Co is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors, including aviation, healthcare, and power.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

GE's cumulative return significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While GE showed a cumulative return of 178.52%, VOO achieved a return of 108.62%. This resulted in a difference of 69.9%, placing it at the 93rd percentile of the historical relative divergence range (max: 83.3, min: -108.7).  This high relative divergence indicates GE's performance was substantially better than the S&P 500 during this period.  However, it's crucial to remember this high relative divergence is only one aspect and other factors such as risk, market conditions, and future performance should be taken into consideration.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows high variability in GE's performance across different periods.  While recent years (2021-2025) show exceptionally strong growth, earlier periods experienced substantial losses.  The high beta values (especially in the earlier periods) highlight GE's high sensitivity to market movements. The alpha values fluctuate significantly, indicating inconsistent outperformance relative to the market.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the years shows growth, however this should be viewed in context with the substantial variation in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown).


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $193.85
* **5-day Moving Average:** $198.63
* **20-day Moving Average:** $203.79
* **60-day Moving Average:** $187.76

The current closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change of -$1.12 indicates a short-term decline.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 33.33 - This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.9991 - This indicates a bearish trend.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.7% -  Confirms a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -11.6% -  This represents the projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon. The negative expected return, despite the past outperformance, suggests caution. The recent price drop (-$1.12) is a minor decline and doesn't signal a drastic market event like a sudden crash or surge.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicates.  A clear and consistent dataset is needed for proper analysis.  However, based on the available (unique) data, there appears to be a gradual increase in both EPS and Revenue. More data is required for a detailed analysis.


| Date       | EPS | Revenue     |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2025-02-03 | 1.76 | $9.88B      |
| 2024-10-22 | 1.71 | $8.94B      |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.16 | $8.22B      |


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows fluctuations, with a significant drop in Q1 2024 followed by a rise. Profit margins have generally been strong, hovering around 35-38%, except for a lower margin in Q1 2024 (27.61%) and Q4 2023 (25.88%). This suggests potential seasonality or other factors influencing profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity fluctuates, showing a significant increase from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024. ROE (Return on Equity) is also inconsistent, with higher figures in recent quarters but lower values in earlier quarters. This again highlights the volatile nature of GE's performance.


| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin | Equity      | ROE    |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| 2024-12-31  | $10.81B     | 37.45%        | $19.34B     | 9.82%  |
| 2024-09-30  | $9.84B      | 36.74%        | $18.87B     | 9.81%  |
| 2024-06-30  | $9.09B      | 38.69%        | $18.60B     | 6.81%  |
| 2024-03-31  | $16.05B     | 27.61%        | $29.86B     | 5.15%  |
| 2023-12-31  | $19.42B     | 25.88%        | $27.40B     | 5.81%  |



**6) Overall Analysis:**

GE has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500 in the past, resulting in a considerably higher cumulative return. However, this performance has been volatile, with periods of substantial losses interspersed with periods of strong growth.  Technical indicators currently suggest a bearish short-term outlook. The long-term expected return is negative compared to the S&P 500.  While recent earnings show improvement, more data is needed for a complete analysis.  The inconsistency in both performance and financial data underscores the inherent risk associated with investing in GE.  Investors should carefully consider this volatility and the negative expected return before making any investment decisions. Further investigation into the underlying drivers of GE's fluctuating performance is necessary.  A more comprehensive analysis should involve a deeper dive into sector-specific trends, competitive landscape, and management strategies.
