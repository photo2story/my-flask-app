## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

General Electric Co (GE) is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors including aviation, healthcare, and power.  The cumulative return of GE is 156.94%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 129.75%.  This represents a difference of 27.2 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 83.9% indicates GE's performance is significantly above the S&P 500's performance relative to its historical range of divergence, though this is relative and does not guarantee future outperformance.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha/beta data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (beta).  While recent years (2021-2024) show positive alpha (outperformance),  earlier periods indicate significant underperformance (negative alpha). The high beta values suggest GE's returns are highly correlated with the overall market, often amplified.  Significant market downturns,  as seen by high maximum drawdown (MDD) values in prior years, heavily impacted GE's performance.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** 181.70
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 180.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 182.13

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend. However, it is above the 20-day moving average.  The Last-market price of 181.59 is not significantly different.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 46.11 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.1751 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):**  NaN (-), indicating recent short-term downward movement.  More data is needed for a definitive assessment.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -17.9%. This suggests potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.  However, this is based on the past data and may not be reliable.


**4. Financial Information:**

The quarterly financial data shows fluctuating revenue and profitability. While revenue figures varied significantly, profit margins have generally been above 25%, although exhibiting some volatility. ROE has also been inconsistent.  More analysis is required to determine long-term trends and financial health.


| Quarter     | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | 9.84        | 36.74%         | 18.87       | 9.81    |
| 2024-06-30 | 9.09        | 38.69%         | 18.60       | 6.81    |
| 2024-03-31 | 16.05       | 27.61%         | 29.86       | 5.15    |
| 2023-12-31 | 19.42       | 25.88%         | 27.38       | 5.81    |
| 2023-09-30 | 9.30        | 35.58%         | 28.66       | 1.23    |


**5. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Earnings News (last 2 days):** This information is missing from the provided data and would significantly influence the analysis.  Recent earnings reports are crucial for evaluating current performance and future prospects.
* **Market Outlook & Analyst Opinions:** This is also missing and needed for a comprehensive assessment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE has shown a strong recent performance exceeding the S&P 500.  However, historical volatility and inconsistent profitability highlight significant risk. The high beta underscores market sensitivity. While recent technical indicators aren't definitively bearish, the negative expected return and lack of crucial recent news (earnings, analyst opinions, market outlook) makes a strong recommendation difficult.  A thorough review of recent earnings releases and market analysis is necessary before drawing firm conclusions about the future performance of GE.  The historical data suggests high risk and volatility.   Further investigation is warranted before considering investment.
