The Alpha values are erratic and, in most periods, negative which could indicate underperformance compared to a benchmark. Beta values are largely around 1, suggesting similar volatility to the market.  However, the significant positive CAGR in the last two periods (2021-2023 and 2022-2024) significantly influence the overall cumulative return, highlighting the importance of considering the time horizon.

Revenue shows some fluctuation, however, profit margins are generally healthy.  ROE also shows some volatility, requiring further investigation into potential contributing factors.  More detailed analysis, including comparison to previous years' data and industry benchmarks, is needed to draw a definitive conclusion about the recent financial performance.


**5.  News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news within the last two days was provided. Information from sources like FINBOLD, Shacknews, or other reliable financial news outlets is required to assess recent market sentiment, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE shows significant outperformance against the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative returns over the observed period, yet the CAGR and Alpha values show inconsistent performance. Recent price action suggests short-term weakness.  Profit margins appear healthy, but revenue shows volatility.  A deeper dive into the financial statements and news articles is required to properly assess the company's current financial health and future prospects.  The -0.7% expected return suggests short-term caution.  The long-term outlook (2+ years), relative to the S&P 500, cannot be definitively assessed without further analysis of the underlying factors driving the current market price and future forecasts.  Additional data on analyst opinions and recent news would complete the analysis.  The information provided offers a preliminary but incomplete assessment.
