## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

GE, a global conglomerate operating in various sectors, shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While specific timeframes aren't explicitly defined, the substantial difference in cumulative returns warrants further investigation into the underlying drivers.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **GE Cumulative Return:** 89.88%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 72.42%
* **Return Difference:** 17.46% (GE outperformed VOO by 17.46 percentage points)
* **Relative Divergence:** 92.7% (indicates GE's performance is in the top 92.7% percentile relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500).  This high relative divergence suggests GE's recent outperformance is relatively rare compared to its historical performance against the market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods.  High beta values (e.g., 86.0 in 2015-2017) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements. Negative alpha values (common in several periods) suggest underperformance relative to the market's risk-adjusted return. However, the positive alpha of 1.1 in 2023-2025 shows significant outperformance. The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) suggests growth and expansion within GE.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind these fluctuating metrics.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -27.0% | 56.9% | -60.0% | 86.0 |
| 2016-2018  | -62.0% | 62.7% | -83.0% | 38.4 |
| 2017-2019  | -26.0% | 62.7% | -60.0% | 59.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 26.0% | 62.7% | -4.0% | 57.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 27.0% | 59.3% | -0.4 | 63.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 0.0% | 75.1% | -0.7 | 56.1 |
| 2021-2023  | 51.0% | 75.1% | -0.8 | 109.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 77.0% | 75.1% | -1.2 | 181.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 73.0% | 81.7% | 1.1 | 193.9 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $178.35
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $182.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $189.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $197.60

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price change of -$1.89 shows a negative trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.20 (Approaching oversold territory; below 30 is generally considered oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.24 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +4.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -11.1% (GE is expected to underperform the S&P 500 by 11.1% over the long term). This negative expected return despite the recent outperformance needs further investigation.  The significant negative price change in the 'Last-market' data supports this negative outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entries for 2025-02-03 and 2025-02-03).  Assuming the duplicates are errors and using only unique entries, there appears to be a general upward trend in both EPS and revenue, although growth is not exceptionally strong.  More consistent and accurate data is needed for a comprehensive analysis.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.71 | $8.94 B     |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.16 | $8.22 B     |
| 2025-02-03 | 1.76 | $9.88 B     |



**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some fluctuation, with a significant drop in Q1 2024. Profit margins have been relatively stable, except for Q1 2024. Equity shows a decrease in Q1 & Q2 2024, likely due to the significant drop in revenue. ROE also shows volatility, highlighting the financial challenges the company faced in the first two quarters of 2024.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.81B | 37.45% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.84B | 36.74% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.09B | 38.69% |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.05B | 27.61% |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.42B | 25.88% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $19.34B | 9.82% |
| 2024-09-30 | $18.87B | 9.81% |
| 2024-06-30 | $18.60B | 6.81% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE's recent performance shows a significant outperformance against the S&P 500, but this is contrasted by a negative long-term expected return and a generally bearish technical outlook (RSI, PPO). The price is currently below its moving averages and the recent price action shows a negative trend.  While recent earnings show an upward trend, the inconsistencies in the data require clarification.  The company's financial health demonstrates some volatility, especially in the first half of 2024.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the reasons behind the fluctuations in alpha and beta, the inconsistencies in the earnings data, and the discrepancy between short-term outperformance and negative long-term expectations, is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment of GE's investment prospects.  Investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties before making any investment decisions.
