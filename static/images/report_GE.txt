Given the strong analyst sentiment and recent positive developments, a cautious "Buy" or "Hold" strategy may be appropriate. Monitor the strike situation closely, as it could significantly impact the company's near-term performance. Also, carefully consider the negative long-term expected return before making any significant investment. While the average target price suggests potential upside, the risks warrant a measured approach.
