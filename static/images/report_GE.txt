**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE has shown strong cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500, particularly in the recent period. However, this is coupled with high volatility and significant risk, as indicated by high Beta and MDD values.  While recent earnings and financial data shows some positive trends, more complete and consistent data would be needed for a more thorough assessment.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests that a long-term investment in GE may not necessarily outperform the market, despite its recent strong performance.  Further investigation into the drivers of this volatility and a more complete picture of the financial situation are necessary before making any investment decisions.  The current medium risk assessment suggests caution.
