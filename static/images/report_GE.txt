**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

General Electric Co is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors including aviation, healthcare, power, and renewable energy.  GE significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, with a cumulative return 19.5 percentage points higher.  However, the high relative divergence suggests this outperformance is unusually high compared to historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and high beta values.  While recent years (2022-2025) show a positive alpha and high CAGR,  earlier periods reveal significantly negative alpha and extremely high beta, indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The substantial change in beta suggests a significant shift in GE's risk profile over time, possibly due to strategic changes or market conditions.  Further investigation is needed to understand the cause of these fluctuations.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -30.0% | 56.3% | -59.0% | 0.1 | 84.3 |
| 2016-2018  | -62.0% | 62.9% | -80.0% | -0.0 | 37.6 |
| 2017-2019  | -26.0% | 62.9% | -55.0% | -0.3 | 57.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 26.0% | 62.9% | 1.0% | -0.3 | 56.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 27.0% | 59.2% | -28.0% | -0.3 | 61.8 |
| 2020-2022  | 1.0% | 75.1% | -0.4 | 55.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 51.0% | 75.1% | 34.0% | -0.5 | 107.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 75.0% | 75.1% | 58.0% | -1.0 | 177.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($181.67) is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $0.09 from the previous close is minimal and doesn't indicate a significant upward swing.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 32.46 suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a bounce. However, the negative PPO (-1.08) shows bearish momentum.  The recent relative divergence (-5.0) confirms a short-term downward trend.  The high MRI (0.47) indicates high market risk.  The projected long-term (2+ years) expected return of -10.2% relative to the S&P 500 suggests underperformance if the current trend continues.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data is inconsistent with duplicate entries.  Assuming the duplicates are errors, revenue is steadily increasing while EPS shows some fluctuation. More consistent data is needed for a thorough analysis.


| 날짜       | EPS | 매출       |
|------------|-----|------------|
| 2025-02-03 | 1.76 | 9.88 B$    |
| 2024-10-22 | 1.71 | 8.94 B$    |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.16 | 8.22 B$    |



**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is growing consistently (excluding the outlier in Q1 2024), although the profit margin shows some volatility.  Equity also shows some fluctuation. ROE is generally low, particularly in Q2 and Q1 of 2024.  Further investigation into the cause of the sharp drop in equity and ROE in Q1 2024 is needed.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.81B | 37.45% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.84B | 36.74% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.09B | 38.69% |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.05B | 27.61% |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.42B | 25.88% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $19.34B | 9.82% |
| 2024-09-30 | $18.87B | 9.81% |
| 2024-06-30 | $18.60B | 6.81% |
| 2024-03-31 | $29.86B | 5.15% |
| 2023-12-31 | $27.40B | 5.81% |


**6. Summary:**

GE has shown substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500 in recent times, but this outperformance seems unusual based on historical data.  The stock is currently trading below its moving averages and shows signs of bearish momentum (negative PPO). Although the RSI suggests oversold conditions, a high market risk indicator and low expected return raise concerns. The financial data reveals inconsistencies that require clarification.  Further investigation is needed to determine the sustainability of current performance and to address the inconsistencies in the provided data before forming a definitive investment conclusion.  The high beta highlights significant volatility, meaning that GE's price might be more sensitive to market changes than average.  Thorough due diligence, including examining the reasons for the inconsistencies in earnings and financial statements, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
