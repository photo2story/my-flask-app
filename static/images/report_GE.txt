## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

General Electric Co (GE) is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors, including aviation, healthcare, and energy.

The provided data shows that GE's cumulative return (149.87%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.69%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 29.2%, placing it at the 77th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided relative divergence metric.  This suggests strong relative performance, although past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in GE's performance over the years, ranging from substantial losses to significant gains. While recent performance (2021-2024) shows strong growth, the historical volatility underscores the risk associated with this stock. The consistently low alpha (around 0.2) indicates that the stock's performance has largely tracked the market, with limited outperformance.  High beta values indicate significant sensitivity to market fluctuations.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $171.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $166.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $172.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $179.05

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (36.7):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a buying opportunity. However, RSI alone shouldn't be the sole basis for investment decisions.
* **PPO (0.084):** A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, although the value is relatively low.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+4.9):** Shows short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (-0.4%):** This suggests a slightly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  The model likely accounts for risk and expected market returns. The current price of $171.49, while near the 20-day moving average, isn't alarmingly high to indicate a sudden price drop.  However, the lower RSI and distance from the 60-day moving average suggest caution.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data shows fluctuating revenue and profitability. While Q1 2024 shows significantly higher revenue than subsequent quarters, profit margins are relatively stable but have seen some fluctuations.  Similarly, equity and ROE exhibit some variability.  A deeper dive into the reasons for these quarterly fluctuations (e.g., seasonal effects, one-time events) is needed for a more comprehensive analysis.  Further investigation into the composition of revenue and profitability across GE's diverse business segments is essential.
