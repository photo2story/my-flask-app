**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $181.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $178.58
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $177.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $180.55

The price is slightly above its 60-day moving average, suggesting a relatively stable recent trend.  The price is also above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 65.24  (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.11 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.13 (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -0.65% (S&P 500 relative)

The RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, potentially indicating a short-term correction. However, the positive PPO and the recent price action suggest ongoing upward momentum.  The negative expected return, relative to the S&P 500, suggests that, at the current price, long-term returns are not anticipated to outperform the market index significantly.  The current price of $181.15 does not appear to represent a drastic jump or drop relative to recent averages, although the RSI does warrant monitoring for possible short-term corrections.

**5. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Data:**  The prompt lacks recent news, earnings announcements (from sources like Shacknews or others), analyst opinions, and market outlook information.  This crucial information is necessary for a thorough analysis.  Information from FINBOLD or similar financial news sources should be included for a complete assessment.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE's historical performance relative to the S&P 500 has been mixed, with periods of significant outperformance and underperformance.  Recent price action suggests a short-term uptrend, but technical indicators (RSI) hint at potential overbought conditions. The lack of recent earnings data and news prevents a robust assessment of current financial health and future prospects. The expected return, relative to the S&P 500, is negative, suggesting that long-term outperformance is not guaranteed at the current price.  More data is needed, specifically news and earnings reports, for a conclusive investment recommendation.
