* **Technical Indicators:** The RSI of 35.51 suggests that the stock is currently in oversold territory. The negative PPO value of -0.73 also points to a potential downward trend. The recent negative delta in the 20-day relative divergence (-6.0) further strengthens the short-term bearish outlook.

GE has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, placing it in a favorable position compared to the broader market. However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downward trend. Technical indicators like RSI and PPO, alongside the negative relative divergence, support this bearish outlook. Nevertheless, the expected return of 14.42% over the next five years remains attractive for long-term investors.
