**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE's recent performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, shown by a large positive cumulative return difference.  However, this is accompanied by high volatility (reflected in the high Beta values in earlier periods).  Recent price action shows a bearish trend, supported by technical indicators (RSI, PPO).  The negative expected return and significant daily price drop are concerning.  A thorough analysis of the inconsistent earnings data and a deeper dive into the reasons behind the recent price drop are needed before drawing definitive conclusions. Further investigation into the company's strategic direction and future prospects is crucial for a complete assessment.  The relatively high and fluctuating equity and ROE values require further investigation to understand their implications.  Given the data presented, a cautious approach is advised.
