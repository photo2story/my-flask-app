**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

General Electric Co. is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors including aviation, healthcare, and power.  GE's cumulative return of 86.08% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 62.30% over the analyzed period.  The 23.8% difference, while impressive, needs to be considered within the context of its historical volatility (relative divergence of 92%).  The high relative divergence suggests that the current outperformance is near the upper end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly variable alpha and beta values across different periods.  While recent periods (2022-2025) show positive alpha, suggesting outperformance, earlier periods display negative alpha and exceptionally high beta values (particularly 2015-2017), indicating high sensitivity to market movements and periods of significant underperformance. The substantial fluctuation in beta implies significant changes in the company's risk profile over time. Market capitalization also increased substantially over the years.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

GE's current price is $182.945, showing a recent decline. It's trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The significant gap between the current price and the moving averages underscores this bearish momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (36.46):** Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-1.80):**  A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change:** A decrease of -1.3 points in the 20-day relative divergence suggests a recent weakening of relative performance versus VOO.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** The MRI of 0.43 suggests a medium risk level.
* **Last Market Data:** The recent price drop of $2.6 (-1.4%) shows some downward pressure. This is not considered a significant drop in relation to its past volatility, but does reflect the current downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** The projected -9.5% long-term return (relative to the S&P 500) suggests underperformance compared to the benchmark index. This is a concerning result.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE has shown periods of strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500, reflected in its high cumulative return.  However, this performance has been volatile, with significant periods of underperformance and high beta. The recent price action suggests a bearish short-term trend, supported by technical indicators.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning. While recent earnings data is inconsistent and requires further clarification, the financial information indicates generally strong profitability.  More consistent and comprehensive data, especially regarding earnings and a clearer picture of long-term strategy, are needed for a more robust and reliable analysis.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the high beta and fluctuating alpha is also recommended.  The current situation presents a mixed picture requiring cautious consideration.
