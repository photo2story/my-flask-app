**1. Performance vs. S&P 500:**

* **Cumulative Return (GE):** 97.24%

**Conclusion:**

GE's recent performance has outperformed the S&P 500, but the historical data reveal significant volatility and periods of substantial losses. While the current technical indicators paint a mostly positive short-term picture, the long-term projected return is negative compared to the S&P 500. Investors should consider GE's high beta and historical volatility before investing, understanding that the potential for high returns is accompanied by equally high risk.  The projected long-term underperformance warrants careful consideration of the risk-reward profile before investing.
