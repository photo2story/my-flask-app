2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of General Electric (GE) based on the data provided:

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** General Electric Co. is a global high-tech industrial company, operating in aerospace and energy sectors.
*   **Return Rate:** GE's cumulative return (110.17%) outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (99.09%) by 11.08%.
*   **Divergence:** The current divergence is 11.08, placing it at the 82nd percentile of its historical range. This indicates a strong recent performance relative to its past divergence history.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   **Volatility:** GE has demonstrated volatile MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures, consistently high across the years.
    *   **Alpha:** GE's Alpha, which measures outperformance relative to the market, fluctuates. While some periods show negative Alpha (underperformance), recent years (2021-2025) show positive Alpha, suggesting it's generating returns independently of the market.
    *   **Beta:** Beta, a measure of systematic risk or volatility relative to the market, is generally low, occasionally turning negative (especially 2019-2022). A lower/negative beta suggests GE may be less sensitive to market movements than the S&P 500 (VOO).
    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR has improved significantly in recent years, with a notable surge in 2023-2025 (116.0%), showing substantial growth.
    *   **Capitalization (Cap):** Market capitalization has seen a significant increase, reaching $319.9B in 2023-2025, indicating strong investor confidence and company growth.

**Analysis:** GE has shown significant outperformance recently compared to the S&P 500. Its volatile nature is evident, but recent positive Alpha and strong CAGR suggest GE is generating independent returns and experiencing growth. The capitalization surge further reinforces this positive trend.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $301.69
*   **Recent Performance:** Last market close saw a price of $301.69, up from a previous close of $292.18, representing a change of 3.25%.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: $298.678
    *   20-day SMA: $291.642
    *   60-day SMA: $299.2728

**Analysis:** The stock price is above all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This suggests a short-term upward trend. The positive change at the last market close further strengthens this indication of upward momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment) - Suggests a moderate level of risk and investment suitability.
*   **RSI:** 52.80 - This value is near the neutral level (50), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** 0.56 - The PPO is positive, confirming the upward trend mentioned earlier.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "Cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash" - A buy signal is generated with caution due to an MRI of 0.7.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The short-term increase in relative divergence (+8.5) signals a short-term upward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** -8.9% - This indicates a negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 if invested long-term (2+ years).

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of risk. While the RSI is neutral, other indicators like PPO and recent divergence indicate positive short-term momentum. However, the negative expected return is a red flag for long-term investors, signaling potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

The news headlines show a mix of factors influencing GE's stock:

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Overall, GE presents a mixed picture:

*   **Positive:** The recent stock performance has been strong, outperforming the S&P 500. This is supported by positive news headlines and analyst consensus. Recent CAGR and increased market capitalization point to growth potential.
*   **Negative:** The negative expected return is a significant concern for long-term investors. There's also an element of caution due to an MRI of 0.7.

**Conclusion:**

GE's stock seems to be experiencing short-term positive momentum, potentially driven by recent events and positive analyst sentiment, but caution should be considered due to the medium level of risk and negative expected long-term return. Investors should be aware of the high volatility and the negative long-term return and monitor ongoing developments, including AI-related concerns. The high target price by analysts may be overly optimistic. Further investigation is needed.
