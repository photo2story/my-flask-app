GE's stock has shown significant growth, with a cumulative return of 132.68%. The stock's recent price fluctuations indicate a slight rebound, with a 5-day SMA of $322.28 and a 20-day SMA of $312.53. However, the stock's risk indicators suggest a medium risk level, with an MRI of 0.80. The Expected Return (%): -2.70% indicates that the stock may not be the best investment option for long-term returns.
