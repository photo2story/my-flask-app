GE's performance has been volatile, with periods of significant underperformance and periods of strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While recent returns have been positive and above the S&P 500, the provided data suggests caution due to inconsistent financial performance and current technical indicators showing a bearish trend.  The relatively low Alpha and fluctuating Beta suggest that while GE can outperform the market, it's highly sensitive to market movements and its outperformance is not consistently achieved.  Missing information regarding recent earnings, market outlook, and analyst opinions prevents a more definitive conclusion.  A thorough review of recent news and a more in-depth analysis of the financial statements are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The -1.6% expected return compared to the S&P 500 needs to be considered alongside this volatile history.
