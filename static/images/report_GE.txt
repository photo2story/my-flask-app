**1. Return Analysis**

    *   GE Cumulative Return: 108.11%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 99.81%

        *   Earlier Periods (2015-2019): Significant negative CAGR and Alpha values.

*   **Simple Analysis:**
    *   **Company Overview:** General Electric Co is a global high-tech industrial company focused on aviation, healthcare, and energy.
    *   GE has outperformed the S&P 500 slightly over the specified period.
    *   The divergence is -4.6, suggesting GE is slightly underperforming its expected movement compared to the S&P500, if we look at historical divergences.  The relative divergence of 71.6 indicates that this divergence is in the upper range of its historical fluctuations.
    *   The Alpha/Beta analysis paints a picture of a company that has significantly improved its performance in recent years.  The early periods show poor returns and significant underperformance relative to the market (negative Alpha).  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows very strong returns, significant outperformance (high Alpha), and higher sensitivity to market movements (Beta of 2.3).

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Simple Numbers:**

    *   20-day SMA: 291.79
    *   60-day SMA: 299.3966

*   **Simple Analysis:**
    *   The stock price decreased slightly in the last trading session.
    *   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This could be interpreted as a short-term upward trend, but the fact that both are hovering around the current price makes any prediction weak.
    *  The slight decrease from the previous day is not expected to have a large effect on the investment.

*   **Simple Numbers:**
    *   MRI: 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)

    *   Expected Return: -12.1%

*   **Simple Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   An RSI of 55.65 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   The PPO is positive, indicating that the 12-day moving average is above the 26-day moving average, which typically signals a short-term bullish trend.
    *   The recent decrease in relative divergence suggests a short-term downward trend.
    *   The negative Expected Return suggests that, based on the model used, the stock is expected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term. This is inconsistent with the positive Alpha observed in recent periods.

However, the negative Expected Return and very high Beta should be investigated further before making any investment decisions. The investor should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon.
