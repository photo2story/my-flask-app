**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

GE's cumulative return (97.24%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (82.57%) by 14.7 percentage points. This places GE at the 90.6th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, based on a range of -110.2% to 27.6%.

* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (Indicates no significant recent change in relative strength)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -11.6% (This suggests that despite GE's recent outperformance, a long-term investment may underperform the S&P 500 by 11.6% over a 2+ year timeframe.  This needs further investigation to determine the validity and the basis of the projection).

**Conclusion:**

GE's recent performance has been strong, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, historical data reveals substantial volatility and periods of significant underperformance.  The provided expected return of -11.6% over the long term warrants careful consideration.  Investors should conduct thorough due diligence, considering GE's diverse business segments, financial health, and future growth prospects before making any investment decisions. The high beta emphasizes the risk associated with this stock. Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of the expected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500.
