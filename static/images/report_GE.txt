**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

GE, a global conglomerate operating in aviation, power, healthcare, and renewable energy, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return is substantially higher than the benchmark.  However, high relative divergence suggests a potential overvaluation or increased risk.  Further investigation is needed to determine the sustainability of this performance.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **GE Cumulative Return:** 197.64%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 120.63%
* **Return Difference:** 77.01% (GE outperformed VOO by 77.01%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 99.7% (Indicates GE's performance is at the 99.7th percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500.)

The provided alpha and beta values show fluctuating performance relative to the market.  While recent years (2021-2025) show high positive alpha, suggesting outperformance, earlier years show negative or low alpha, indicating underperformance.  The high beta values, especially in the earlier periods, indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The significantly increased market cap over time also contributes to the high returns, which reflects company growth and positive market reaction.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE has shown impressive cumulative returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this high relative divergence, coupled with overbought RSI and a negative long-term expected return (which requires further investigation for validity), warrants caution.  The fluctuating alpha and beta values highlight the volatility of GE's performance.  A thorough examination of the underlying drivers of recent high returns is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data contains inconsistencies (duplicate entries in earnings data) requiring clarification.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the financial statements and market conditions, is recommended before forming a definitive investment opinion.
