**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent, with duplicate entries for some dates.  A more complete and consistent dataset is needed for a thorough analysis.  However, based on the available information revenue has been increasing over the past year while EPS has been somewhat stable with some minor fluctuations.


| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출      |
|------------|------|-----------|

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows a fluctuating revenue trend and profit margin.  The recent quarters show a decrease in revenue and profitability compared to earlier quarters. ROE is also showing a fluctuating trend with a significant drop between the Q2 and Q1 of 2024, likely due to a significant increase in equity. Further analysis would be needed to determine the drivers of these fluctuations.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE has shown periods of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in recent years. However, its high beta indicates substantial market risk.  Current technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, while the long-term outlook (as indicated by the -11.8% expected return relative to the S&P 500) is less optimistic.  Inconsistent earnings data and fluctuating financial information require further investigation.  Investors should carefully consider the inherent risk and volatility before investing in GE.  The high historical volatility and inconsistent performance warrant a cautious approach.  A thorough due diligence, including examination of the inconsistencies in the provided data and further financial analysis, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
