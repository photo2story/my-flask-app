**0. Key Figures Summary:**

GE's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price action shows GE trading below its key moving averages, suggesting potential downside risk.  While recent earnings show growth, certain financial metrics warrant further investigation.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

General Electric Co (GE) is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors including aviation, healthcare, and power.
