**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows mixed results regarding GE's alpha and beta. While alpha is consistently positive, indicating outperformance, beta fluctuates significantly, suggesting varying levels of market sensitivity over time.  The substantial changes in beta might indicate changes in GE's business composition and risk profile over the years.  High beta values (e.g., 2.1) in some periods imply significantly higher volatility than the market. The consistently positive alpha suggests some degree of manager skill or unique characteristics driving the stockâ€™s return beyond market movements, but this is not a guarantee.  Capitalization (Cap) also fluctuates, reflecting changes in market valuation.

Further investigation into the company's current strategic direction and its impact on future performance is crucial before making any investment decision.
