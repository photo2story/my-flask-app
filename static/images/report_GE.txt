*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the excess return relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500).  Negative alpha values indicate underperformance compared to the benchmark. Positive alpha values in recent periods suggest GE is now generating excess returns.
*   **Beta:**  Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market.  A beta of 1 indicates the stock moves in line with the market. A beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility than the market. The recent beta of 2.0 for 2023-2025 is very high, showing that GE's price movements have been more volatile than the market.
