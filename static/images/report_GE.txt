## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

GE's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn, but long-term prospects appear relatively positive given the earnings growth and profitability indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

General Electric Co. is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors including aviation, healthcare, and energy.

* **Cumulative Return:** GE: 86.71%, VOO: 66.69%
* **Return Difference:** GE outperformed VOO by 20.02 percentage points.  This places GE at the 89.3rd percentile of its historical relative performance against VOO (based on provided max/min range).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta) and significant volatility (MDD). While recent years (2022-2025) show strong positive Alpha (outperformance), earlier periods show negative Alpha and extremely high Beta, indicating high market sensitivity.  Capitalization (Cap) has also increased significantly during this period.


**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $186.0
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $181.16
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $194.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $198.09

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price change of $2.38 reflects a small jump from the previous close, potentially hinting at some short-term recovery or price fluctuation, but not necessarily a sustained upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 34.42 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential rebound)
* **PPO:** -0.6896 (Bearish signal)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -5.2% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -10% (Expected to underperform S&P 500 by 10% over a long-term investment horizon of 2+ years).  This is counter-intuitive given the historical outperformance and requires further investigation into the basis for this projection.

The recent price increase is noteworthy, but given the other indicators, it might be a temporary bounce within a larger downtrend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|

There's a significant discrepancy in the data;  the same EPS and revenue figures are repeated multiple times.  Further clarification or corrected data is needed for accurate earnings analysis. The data suggests some level of earnings consistency but lacks reliability due to repetition.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE's historical performance relative to the S&P 500 has been strong, but recent indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend. While the recent earnings data is inconsistent and requires clarification, the available financial information shows healthy profitability.  The conflicting long-term expected return projection (-10%) requires further examination.  A thorough analysis requires resolving data inconsistencies and a deeper dive into the factors contributing to the projected negative long-term return relative to the market.  The high Beta suggests that GE's performance is highly sensitive to market fluctuations, requiring careful consideration of the overall market outlook when assessing investment strategy.
