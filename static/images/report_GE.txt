## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Performance Review

**Executive Summary:** General Electric Co is a multinational conglomerate corporation operating in various sectors including aviation, healthcare, and power. This report analyzes GE's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and evaluating its technical indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

GE's cumulative return (92.15%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (76.31%) by 15.8 percentage points.  This places its relative divergence at the 91.4th percentile based on historical data (max: 27.6%, min: -110.2%).  However, this single data point needs to be considered alongside longer-term trends and volatility.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a mixed performance over the years. While recent years (2022-2025) show strong positive CAGR and a high alpha (indicating outperformance relative to the market), earlier periods demonstrate significant negative returns and negative alphas, especially high negative betas showing higher volatility than the market in those periods.  The substantial fluctuations in Beta across different periods highlight the significant risk associated with GE stock.  The significant size of GE's market capitalization (Cap(B)) throughout this period also contributes to the company's influence on overall market performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

GE's closing price is $189.18.  The stock experienced a significant one-day increase of $6.07 (3.4%) compared to the previous close.

* **5-day moving average:** $183.49
* **20-day moving average:** $188.72
* **60-day moving average:** $197.47

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend, although the recent sharp increase warrants closer examination.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.52 (Slightly below neutral; suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.148 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, although relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -11.4% (This is a significant negative expected return relative to the market, and should be investigated in more detail, including the confidence interval around this estimate)

The recent price increase of $6.07 reflects a significant upward movement that needs further investigation to determine if it is sustainable or a temporary anomaly.

The -11.4% expected return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 indicates a potential underperformance relative to the broader market index in the longer run, despite recent positive returns. This negative expected return should prompt a thorough investigation into the underlying assumptions and factors contributing to this projection.  Further analysis, incorporating factors like future earnings projections and industry trends, is vital for a more informed investment decision.
