**6) Overall Analysis:**

GE's stock performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the recent period, showing a large positive cumulative return. However, historical data reveals high volatility and periods of significant underperformance.  While recent technical indicators suggest a short-term bullish trend, the RSI is approaching overbought levels. The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 warrants caution for long-term investors.  Further analysis is needed to clarify the duplicated earnings data and understand the volatility in equity and ROE.  The large difference in performance compared to the S&P 500 should be further investigated for sustainability and to identify the drivers of this outperformance.
