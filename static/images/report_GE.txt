**7. Summary:**

GE has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the past period, showing a strong cumulative return.

Currently, the stock price is trending downwards, as indicated by its position relative to its moving averages and a negative PPO.  Technical indicators are neutral, with RSI not signaling strong overbought or oversold conditions. The long-term outlook (2+ years) suggests underperformance relative to the S&P 500, although further information on the market outlook and analyst sentiment is crucial for a complete assessment. The financial data shows significant variability in both revenue and profitability, requiring more in-depth analysis to understand underlying factors.
