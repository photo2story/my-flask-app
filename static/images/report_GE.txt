## General Electric Co (GE) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

GE, a multinational conglomerate operating in various sectors, has shown significantly higher cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The substantial divergence warrants further investigation into the drivers of this outperformance.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison:**

* **GE Cumulative Return:** 198.97%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 116.17%
* **Return Difference:** 82.8% (This represents the difference in cumulative returns between GE and the S&P 500 at the end of the period.  The relative divergence of 99.7% indicates that this difference is near the historical maximum based on the provided min/max range).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $206.98
* **Last Market Price:** $205.59 (a decrease of -$0.67 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $201.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $205.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $186.05

The price is currently slightly below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting potential near-term downward pressure.  However, it's significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend.  The recent slight price drop (-0.67) is not significant enough to be considered a sharp decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.98 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** -0.78 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +6.5 (This suggests short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -10.0% (This indicates a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon of 2+ years).  This is counterintuitive given the high historical returns of GE shown earlier and warrants further investigation and context.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent, with duplicate entries for 2025-02-03 and 2025-02-03 and again for 2025-02-03 and 2025-02-03.  Data cleaning and consistent reporting are crucial for accurate analysis.  Assuming the duplicates represent errors, the data shows a general upward trend in both EPS and revenue, but a more refined dataset is needed for a conclusive analysis.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue       |
|------------|-----|----------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.71 | $8.94 B        |
| 2024-07-23 | 1.16 | $8.22 B        |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows some volatility. Revenue shows a general increasing trend from Q3 2023 to Q4 2024 but Q1 2024 exhibits a big spike in revenue, requiring further investigation of potential factors contributing to that quarterâ€™s results. Profit margins are generally high but fluctuate significantly across quarters.  Equity and ROE also show variability.  A deeper dive into the underlying drivers of these fluctuations is necessary to draw meaningful conclusions.

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity      | ROE  |
|------------|------------|---------------|-------------|------|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.81B    | 37.45%        | $19.34B     | 9.82% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.84B     | 36.74%        | $18.87B     | 9.81% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.09B     | 38.69%        | $18.60B     | 6.81% |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.05B    | 27.61%        | $29.86B     | 5.15% |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.42B    | 25.88%        | $27.40B     | 5.81% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

GE's significantly higher cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500 are noteworthy. However, the provided data requires significant clarification and further analysis. Inconsistent earnings data and fluctuating financial metrics necessitate a deeper investigation into the underlying drivers of GE's performance.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, despite past outperformance, raises concerns and needs further scrutiny.  A comprehensive analysis should involve examining the company's strategic direction, industry trends, and potential risks to understand the sustainability of its past performance and to validate the projected negative long-term return.  More robust and consistent data are critical for a reliable conclusion.
