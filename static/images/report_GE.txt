**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Significant volatility in the CAGR over the years, ranging from -73% to 103%, indicating periods of both strong growth and decline. Recent years (2021-2025) show strong positive CAGR.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) across all periods suggests considerable risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha was negative in most periods, particularly in the early years, indicating underperformance relative to the market. However, it has turned positive in recent years, especially 2022-2025, showing outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, suggesting GE's price movements are not strongly correlated with the market. The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a significantly higher beta, indicating increased sensitivity to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has increased significantly in recent years, reflecting investor confidence and business growth.

## 2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations

*   **Current Close:** 283.60
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 299.81, Previous Close: 288.42, Change: 3.95
*   **5-day SMA:** 286.38
*   **20-day SMA:** 293.6875
*   **60-day SMA:** 299.5107

**Analysis:** The stock price has recently rebounded significantly, as evidenced by the "change" value in the Last Market Data and the higher price of 299.81. The price is currently below all moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend, although this could reverse quickly given the recent bounce.

## 3. Indicator Analysis

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 34.47 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** -0.3594 (Below zero, indicating a potential downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). This suggests a strong buy signal based on the model's assessment of risk.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -4.4 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -11.4% (Negative expected return over the long term compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The RSI indicates that GE is approaching oversold conditions, which could signal a potential buying opportunity. The PPO, however, suggests a potential downtrend. The Hybrid Signal strongly recommends buying, while the expected return is quite negative. It is very important to note here that this negative expected return is in contradiction with the strong buy signal, analyst rating and recent news. The negative expected return may be due to the fact that the stock is considered to be overvalued at the moment, or this value may be wrong.
