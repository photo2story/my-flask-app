**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows significant volatility. The most recent period (2023-2025) shows exceptional growth (127.0%), while earlier periods show substantial losses.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is mostly negative in earlier periods, suggesting underperformance relative to the benchmark. However, recent periods (2021-2025) show positive alpha, indicating GE is generating excess returns compared to what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values are generally low, even negative. The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a significantly high beta of 2.3, implying that GE's price is now much more sensitive to market movements than previously.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization has increased significantly in recent years.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 307.54
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 307.475

    *   20-day MA: 304.05
    *   60-day MA: 290.62

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day moving average but above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. The recent "change" of 1.08 from the previous close is not especially high, so I will not call it "급반등,급하락", so no significant short-term momentum should be inferred.

*   **RSI:** 58.40 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** -3.2 (Short-term Decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** -8.4% (Projected excess return relative to S&P 500 for a long-term, dollar-cost averaging strategy.)

**Analysis:**  The MRI suggests that the market conditions are conducive to investment. However, the negative expected return suggests caution, indicating potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the long term. Recent 20-day relative spread is decreased.

    *   Average: 343.57
    *   High: 374.00

**Overall Summary and Recommendation**

GE has shown strong recent performance, outperforming the S&P 500, especially in the most recent period. Analyst sentiment is largely positive, with a consensus "Strong Buy" rating and an average price target significantly above the current price.

However, the negative expected return warrants caution. While the MRI suggests a favorable market environment, the projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the long term is a concern. The recent decline in the relative spread also suggests weakening relative performance.

**Recommendation:**
I will classify this stock as "HOLD" as the positive outlook needs to be offset by high risks.
