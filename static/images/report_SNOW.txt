| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -44.0%   | 21.1%   | -0.0    | 47.4    |        |
| 2021-2023  | -7.0%    | 21.1%   | -0.1    | 65.7    |        |
| 2022-2024  | -19.0%   | 21.1%   | -0.1    | 51.0    |        |
| 2023-2025  | 25.0%    | 11.8%   | -0.4    | 58.7    |        |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

SNOW's current price is below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The price is slightly above its 60-day moving average, implying some potential support.  The recent price drop of -$3.82 represents a significant daily decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 46.49 is near the neutral level (50), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.  The negative PPO (-0.75) suggests bearish momentum. The recent 20-day relative divergence decrease of -3.0 points to a short-term bearish trend.  The expected return of -147.6% is exceptionally negative and suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), even considering potential future growth.  The large negative price change further strengthens the concerns about potential downside risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Snowflake continues to report negative EPS, although revenue is steadily increasing.  However, the consistent net losses raise concerns about profitability.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of these losses and the company's path to profitability.

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98    | $0.94 B     |
| 2024-08-29 | -0.95    | $0.87 B     |
| 2024-05-31 | -0.95    | $0.83 B     |
| 2023-12-01 | -0.65    | $0.73 B     |
| 2024-11-27 | -0.65    | $0.73 B     | *(Duplicate Data Entry Suspected)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue growth is positive, but profit margins are slightly decreasing.  The negative ROE across all quarters is a significant concern, suggesting the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  The decrease in equity from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024 is notable and warrants further analysis.

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity   | ROE      |
|------------|------------|---------------|----------|----------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B     | 65.94%        | $2.93B   | -11.07%  |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B     | 66.84%        | $4.13B   | -7.67%   |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B     | 67.12%        | $4.56B   | -6.95%   |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B     | 68.79%        | $5.18B   | -3.27%   |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.73B     | 68.82%        | $4.93B   | -4.35%   |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500, exhibiting negative alpha and high beta.  While revenue is growing, consistent net losses and negative ROE raise substantial concerns.  The recent price drop and technical indicators suggest bearish momentum. The extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 strongly cautions against long-term investment unless significant improvement in profitability and market sentiment is observed.  Further investigation into the drivers of negative EPS and declining ROE is crucial before considering any investment.  The duplicated data entry in the earnings report should be investigated and corrected.
