**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-10-31 | $1.21B    | 67.77%        |
| 2025-07-31 | $1.14B    | 67.53%        |
| 2025-04-30 | $1.04B    | 66.53%        |
| 2025-01-31 | $0.99B    | 66.23%        |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B    | 65.94%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-10-31 | $2.13B    | -13.78%   |
| 2025-07-31 | $2.37B    | -12.56%   |
| 2025-04-30 | $2.41B    | -17.86%   |

| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B    | -11.07%   |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue is steadily increasing, and the profit margin is consistently high (around 66-68%). This indicates strong operational efficiency. However, the negative ROE (Return on Equity) reflects the company's continued unprofitability. The equity is also fluctuating, which could be related to stock issuance or other capital activities.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Overall:** Snowflake presents a mixed investment picture. The company demonstrates strong revenue growth, high profit margins, and a generally positive analyst outlook. However, it is currently unprofitable, as evidenced by negative EPS and ROE.
*   **Risks:** The stock is more volatile than the market (high Beta), and it has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. The high MDD and negative Alpha further highlight these risks.
*   **Opportunities:** The growing customer base, potential in the AI space, and analyst upgrades suggest potential for future growth. If Snowflake can achieve profitability while maintaining its revenue growth and high profit margins, the stock could see significant upside.
*   **Recommendation:** The MRI suggests a medium investment risk, but given the high volatility and current lack of profitability, investors should proceed with caution. A small allocation, aligned with a high-risk tolerance, might be appropriate. Careful monitoring of earnings reports and company progress toward profitability is essential. The hybrid signal recommends buying.
