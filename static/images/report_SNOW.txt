**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Shows highly variable performance across different periods. The negative CAGR in earlier periods is a concern, though the most recent period shows a strong positive return.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown indicates significant price volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  The negative alpha in earlier periods indicates underperformance relative to the market, while the recent positive alpha suggests some outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta is close to zero, showing the stock is not correlated to the market.
*   **Cap(B):**  Indicates Snowflake's market capitalization in billions during each period.

**2. Recent Price Action**

**Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The minor price increase in the last market session indicates a potential slight positive shift, but further confirmation is needed. The 5-day MA is approaching the 20-day, which would be a bearish signal if it crosses below it.

*   The PPO is negative, confirming a downtrend.
*   The hybrid signal suggests a cautious approach, recommending increasing the cash position to 68%.

*   The very negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting poor long-term prospects relative to the S&P 500.
*   The positive `change` between `previousClose` and `price` reflects a slight rebound, but does not overshadow the broader downward trends.

*   **High Volatility:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate considerable price volatility.

*   **Downtrend:** The stock is currently in a downtrend, trading below key moving averages.
*   **Cautious Technical Signals:** The Hybrid Signal recommends a cautious approach.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The very negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests poor long-term prospects.

**Recommendation:**

Given the significant risks, underperformance, and negative financial metrics, a cautious or bearish stance on SNOW is warranted. Investors should carefully monitor the company's earnings, news, and financial performance for any signs of improvement before considering a long-term investment. The oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the overall trend remains negative.
