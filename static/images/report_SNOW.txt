## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

SNOW's recent performance shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  While VOO has shown substantial growth, SNOW has experienced negative returns.  Key indicators like RSI suggest overbought conditions, while the PPO indicates positive momentum, but this is contrasted with a negative expected return.  Recent earnings reveal increasing revenue but continued losses.  Furthermore, while profitability margins remain strong, Return on Equity (ROE) is negative.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.

* **Cumulative Return (SNOW):** -1.00%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 73.81%
* **Return Difference (SNOW vs. VOO):** -74.8%
* **Relative Divergence:** 22.3% (This means the current underperformance is at the 22.3rd percentile relative to the historical range of under/outperformance against the VOO.)

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently negative alpha, indicating underperformance relative to the market, and a high beta, suggesting significant volatility and market sensitivity.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures are also negative across most periods, highlighting the stock's struggle to deliver positive returns.

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|

| 2021-2023  | -7.0%  | 21.1%  | -0.1   | 65.7   |        |
| 2022-2024  | -19.0% | 21.1%  | -0.1   | 51.0   |        |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $181.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $181.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $170.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $160.10

The price is currently above its 5-day moving average, indicating short-term upward momentum. However, it's significantly above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent rapid price increase.  The last day's price movement shows a small increase ($1.24)  representing a slight, positive change.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 71.99 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.64 (Positive momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years, vs. S&P 500):** -142.4% (Significant underperformance projected)


The high RSI value suggests the stock may be overbought, potentially indicating a short-term correction is due.  However, the positive PPO and the recent price increase offer conflicting signals.  The exceptionally negative expected return, however, strongly indicates significant future underperformance relative to the S&P 500, even with a long-term investment horizon. The recent increase might be a temporary surge, and it's crucial to consider the negative expected return prediction.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake exhibits a perplexing situation.  While revenue is growing steadily and profit margins are high, the company's negative EPS and, more critically, negative ROE raise serious concerns about long-term sustainability and profitability. The stock's performance significantly lags the market, and the projected long-term underperformance is substantial. While short-term indicators show some positive momentum, the fundamental issues need to be addressed before considering a long-term investment.  Further investigation into the reasons for negative ROE despite strong revenue and profit margins is necessary before making any investment decision. The current price action may be a temporary surge, and caution is advised.
