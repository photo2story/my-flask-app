**6) Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake exhibits strong revenue growth but continues to operate at a loss, reflected in negative EPS and ROE.  The high Beta suggests significant market volatility, and the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 considerably.  While recent price action shows a short-term upward trend, the negative long-term expected return and negative PPO suggest caution.  Investors should carefully consider the company's path to profitability and its high volatility before investing.  The current valuation seems high given the lack of profitability and consistent underperformance relative to the market.
