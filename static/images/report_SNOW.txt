*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) remains consistently high across all periods, ranging from 75.3% to 79.8%. This high MDD indicates significant risk and volatility in the investment, meaning investors could experience substantial losses from peak to trough during these times.

Specifically, the negative alpha suggests that the investment provided lower returns than expected, given its risk (beta). The Alpha values range from -46.0% to -1.0%.
