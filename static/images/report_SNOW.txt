The current price of SNOW is $187.60.  The stock price is slightly above its 5-day moving average ($187.43), suggesting recent stability. However, it's trading above both its 20-day ($182.31) and 60-day ($170.72) moving averages, hinting at a potential upward trend, although this needs further investigation into market conditions.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-0.9):** Shows a recent short-term decline in performance relative to the market.
* **Expected Return (-136.7%):**  This extremely negative expected return suggests a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, based on current conditions.  This highlights the high risk associated with SNOW.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows consistent net losses (EPS) and increasing revenue over time. However, the losses are concerning.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of these losses and the company's path to profitability.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of crucial financial data like "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" significantly limits the depth of this analysis.  This information is critical for a comprehensive assessment of SNOW's financial health and future prospects.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake (SNOW) exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, as evidenced by its negative alpha, high beta, and considerably lower cumulative return.  While the recent price action shows some signs of stability and potential upward movement, the negative expected return and consistent net losses raise significant concerns. The lack of key financial data further hinders a thorough evaluation.  Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering an investment in SNOW, given the high risk profile and significant underperformance relative to the market. The high negative expected return highlights the challenges and risks.  Further research into the company's financials and business model is strongly recommended.
