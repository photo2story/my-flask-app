Alpha, Beta analysis | Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|

| 2023-2025  | 65.0% | 79.8% | 1.0% | -0.0 | 84.2 |

* **CAGR:** The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) varies significantly across the periods. The early periods show substantial negative growth (-25% to -26%), while the most recent period (2023-2025) shows a high positive CAGR of 65%.
* **MDD:** The maximum drawdown (MDD) is consistently high across all periods, ranging from 75.3% to 79.8%. This indicates significant volatility and risk associated with the stock.
* **Alpha:** The alpha values are largely negative for the earlier periods (-9% to -46%), suggesting that the stock underperformed relative to its benchmark. However, the most recent period shows a positive alpha of 1%, indicating some outperformance.
* **Beta:** The beta values are close to 0, suggesting that the stock's price is not highly correlated with the overall market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 250.39
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 248.63, Previous Close: 250.32, Change: -0.68
*   **5-day SMA:** 244.81
*   **20-day SMA:** 260.28
*   **60-day SMA:** 243.39

**Analysis:** The stock price closed at $250.39 but the last market price was slightly lower, $248.63, showing a small decline. The 5-day SMA is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating a recent downward trend.  The 20-day SMA being significantly higher than the 5-day and 60-day SMA might suggest a period of previous price strength followed by a recent pullback.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 39.35
*   **PPO:** -1.33
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -7.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -21.6

**Analysis:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests a generally favorable investment environment. However, the RSI of 39.35 suggests the stock is nearing oversold conditions, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, but needs to be confirmed with other indicators. The negative PPO indicates the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the recent downward trend observed in the SMAs. The hybrid signal recommends a full buy, aligning with the high MRI.  The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days confirms a recent short-term decline. The negative expected return of -21.6% is a significant concern and suggests potential downside risk if held for more than 2 years.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Mixed Headlines:** The news headlines present a mixed picture. Some articles discuss valuation concerns, reduced holdings by some investors (Picton Mahoney Asset Management), and a director selling shares. Other articles highlight a recent surge, a new buy recommendation, and investor interest following quarterly results.

**Analysis:**  The news provides conflicting signals. The surge mentioned in one article ("Snowflake Stock Surged 90%") needs to be put in context with the other news items. The director selling shares and reduced holdings are potentially negative signals, while a new buy recommendation is positive.  It's crucial to dig deeper into the specifics of each news item to form a well-rounded opinion. The articles about valuation and quarterly results provide important information for assessing the company's fundamental health.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.60)
*   **Opinions:** 47
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 272.69 / High: 500.00 / Low: 170.00

**Analysis:**  The analyst consensus is a "Buy," suggesting that analysts generally view the stock favorably.  The average target price of $272.69 is above the current price, implying potential upside. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices ($170 to $500) indicates a significant level of uncertainty among analysts regarding the stock's future performance. The 'recent rating changes' section is empty, meaning rating has been steady.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출      |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 2025-09-05 | -0.89 | 1.14 B$   |
| 2025-05-30 | -1.29 | 1.04 B$   |
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98 | 0.94 B$   |
| 2024-08-29 | -0.95 | 0.87 B$   |
| 2025-09-05 | -0.95 | 0.87 B$   |

**Analysis:** Snowflake is consistently reporting negative EPS (Earnings Per Share), indicating the company is not yet profitable. While revenue is generally increasing, the continued losses are a concern. The second entry for '2025-09-05' is identical to '2024-08-29' but is probably a reporting error. More recent revenue increases but profits are still in the negative. This means while the business is expanding, it still comes at a negative impact to per-share-earnings.

**Analysis:** Revenue is consistently increasing, which is a positive sign. The profit margins are also high, above 65%, indicating that Snowflake is efficiently generating profit from its revenue. However, the negative ROE (Return on Equity) values confirm that the company is not yet generating profits for its shareholders. The decreasing equity could also be a concern.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Snowflake (SNOW) presents a mixed investment picture.

*   **Positives:** High revenue growth, strong profit margins, a "Buy" analyst consensus, and a potentially oversold RSI. The Market Risk Indicator suggests a generally favorable environment.
*   **Negatives:** SNOW has underperformed the S&P 500. Consistent negative EPS and negative ROE indicate that the company is currently unprofitable. The high maximum drawdown values highlight the stock's volatility. Recent news contains some negative elements, including insider selling and reduced holdings by some investors. The negative expected return of -21.6% is also a significant concern.
*   **Neutral:** The technical indicators show recent short-term weakness but also potentially oversold conditions.

**Conclusion:** Based on this data, investing in Snowflake is high-risk and potentially high-reward. While the company shows strong growth potential and high profit margins, its lack of profitability and underperformance relative to the market are significant concerns. Investors should carefully weigh these factors and conduct further due diligence before making an investment decision. Consider the news carefully, and pay attention to the company's progress towards profitability in future earnings reports.
