The high beta values consistently show SNOW's significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  Negative alpha values suggest underperformance relative to the market benchmark. The CAGR shows improvement over time, but still indicates substantial periods of negative returns.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $148.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $144.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $162.36

The current price is slightly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating some recent recovery.  The recent price decline (-0.16) is relatively small and not indicative of a significant market event.

* **Expected Return (Long-term, 2+ years):** -62.5% (relative to S&P 500)

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98   | $0.94 B     |
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95   | $0.87 B     |

| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65   | $0.73 B     |

The company consistently reports negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  While revenue is growing, the negative EPS suggests that the company is not yet profitable and operational efficiency needs improvement. The duplicated entry for 2024-11-27 needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $0.99B | 66.23% |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B | 65.94% |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B | 66.84% |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B | 67.12% |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B | 68.79% |

Revenue shows steady growth, however, profit margins are high despite negative EPS. This warrants further investigation into accounting practices.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-01-31 | $3.00B | -10.92% |

| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B | -7.67% |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B | -6.95% |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B | -3.27% |

Negative ROE consistently indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity.  The fluctuation in equity values also needs further explanation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth but remains unprofitable, with consistently negative EPS and ROE.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent price action suggests some short-term recovery, the negative long-term expected return and high beta suggest significant risk.  Further investigation into the high profit margins despite negative EPS and the fluctuating equity values is necessary.  The data suggests caution before investing in SNOW, particularly given the projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500.  A deeper dive into the financial statements and a more comprehensive analysis of the company's growth strategy and path to profitability are required before making any investment decisions.
