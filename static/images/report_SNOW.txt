**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -46.0% | 70.5%  | -0.1  | 48.0  |        |
| 2021-2023  | -33.0% | 70.5%  | -0.0  | 66.5  |        |
| 2022-2024  | -13.0% | 73.9%  | -0.0  | 51.6  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 27.0%  | 73.9%  | -0.1  | 49.2  |        |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $147.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $142.83
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $144.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $163.26

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend.  The recent price increase (from $140.23 to $147.39) is a notable short-term bounce, but it needs to be viewed in the context of the longer-term downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.57 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.572 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, although the value isn't extremely high)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** 0.3 (Positive, short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -69.5% (This signifies a significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. This is a concerning indicator).

The recent price change of $5.11 represents a significant positive change but is too short-term to be indicative of a sustained trend reversal.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98 | $0.94 B      |
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95 | $0.87 B      |
| 2024-05-31 | -$0.95 | $0.83 B      |
| 2023-12-01 | -$0.65 | $0.73 B      |
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65 | $0.73 B      |


Revenue is showing a generally increasing trend, but the company is consistently reporting negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  The duplicated entry for November 27th, 2024 needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31  | $0.99B    | 66.23%        |
| 2024-10-31  | $0.94B    | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31  | $0.87B    | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30  | $0.83B    | 67.12%        |
| 2024-01-31  | $0.77B    | 68.79%        |

Revenue is growing, but profitability is not reflected in net income (EPS is negative). High profit margins are positive.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| 2025-01-31  | $3.00      | -10.92  |
| 2024-10-31  | $2.93      | -11.07  |
| 2024-07-31  | $4.13      | -7.67   |
| 2024-04-30  | $4.56      | -6.95   |
| 2024-01-31  | $5.18      | -3.27   |

Equity shows some fluctuation.  The negative ROE consistently indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity investment.  This is a significant concern.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth but is suffering from consistent losses (negative EPS and ROE).  While the stock experienced a recent short-term bounce, its long-term performance is significantly underperforming the S&P 500. The high Beta indicates considerable market risk, and the negative expected return suggests a bearish outlook.  The duplicated earnings data requires clarification. Before considering investment, a deeper dive into the reasons for the persistent losses and future growth prospects is necessary.  The current situation presents substantial risk.
