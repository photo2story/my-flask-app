**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -46.0%    | 70.5% | -0.46 | 48.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -33.0%    | 70.5% | -0.33 | 66.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -13.0%    | 73.9% | -0.13 | 51.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 25.0%     | 73.9% | 0.25  | 47.9 |

The table shows high volatility (MDD consistently above 70%) and negative alpha in the earlier years, indicating underperformance relative to the market (considering Beta). However, recent years show improving CAGR and positive alpha suggesting a potential turnaround.  The high beta values across all periods highlight significant market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $143.43
* **Previous Close:** $146.08
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $145.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $147.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $164.93

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price drop of -$1.81 (Last-market data) reinforces this.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.78 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.59 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum but needs context of historical values)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -70.4% (This exceptionally negative figure needs further clarification regarding its calculation and timeframe. It is not directly comparable with typical return metrics.)

The relatively low RSI and negative price movement suggest a potential for further downside. However, the positive PPO indicates some buying momentum.  The extremely negative expected return warrants further investigation into its methodology and assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98  | $0.94 B     |
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95  | $0.87 B     |

| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65  | $0.73 B     | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*

The data shows consistent negative EPS.  Revenue is growing, but not at a pace sufficient to offset the losses. The duplicate entry needs correction for accurate analysis.

|---------|---------|----------|

| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B | -6.95%   |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B | -3.27%   |

Equity fluctuates, and ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  This is a major concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth but continues to operate with negative EPS and ROE.  The stock significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a considerable negative alpha in the past. While recent quarters show improved CAGR and a positive alpha, the high beta reflects significant market risk.  The current price is below key moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  Technical indicators offer a mixed signal.  The exceptionally negative expected return requires further clarification.  Given the consistent negative EPS and ROE, a long-term investment decision requires careful consideration of the company's strategy to achieve profitability.  Further analysis of the company's long-term growth prospects and its path to profitability is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided -70.4% expected return is exceptionally low and necessitates further investigation into its calculation and justification.
