## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.

The cumulative return of SNOW (-4.58%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 76.73%.  The difference is a staggering -81.3%, placing it at the 17.9th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500.  This indicates SNOW's substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided CAGR data shows inconsistent performance over different timeframes, ranging from significant negative returns to positive returns in the most recent period.  High maximum drawdown (MDD) values highlight the risk associated with SNOW. Notably, the beta consistently hovers around 58, suggesting significantly higher volatility than the market.  Alpha consistently near zero implies the stock's returns are largely explained by market movements, without significant manager skill.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $174.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $172.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $163.85
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $153.76

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, but the negative daily change (-$1.44) shows a small recent decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 80.04 – This indicates the stock is currently in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.75 – A positive value suggests upward momentum, albeit not extremely strong.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.8 – Shows a recent downward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** -188.1% – This extremely negative long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern, suggesting a substantial risk of continued underperformance.  The large negative value underscores the risk of investing in SNOW compared to the S&P 500.  The recent price decrease further strengthens this concerning outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals consistent negative EPS over the past few quarters, though revenue is steadily increasing.  There is a discrepancy in the provided data for the 2024-11-27 quarter, with two entries showing different EPS.  Further investigation and clarification are necessary.  Overall, the company is not yet profitable.

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |

| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98   | $0.94B        |

| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65   | $0.73B        |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data indicates strong revenue growth, with consistent high profit margins despite negative earnings. This is a positive sign, but it's critical to understand what is driving these margins and whether they are sustainable.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31  | $0.94B       | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31  | $0.87B       | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30  | $0.83B       | 67.12%        |
| 2024-01-31  | $0.77B       | 68.79%        |
| 2023-10-31  | $0.73B       | 68.82%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity       | ROE           |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31  | $2.93B       | -11.07%       |
| 2024-07-31  | $4.13B       | -7.67%        |
| 2024-04-30  | $4.56B       | -6.95%        |
| 2024-01-31  | $5.18B       | -3.27%        |
| 2023-10-31  | $4.93B       | -4.35%        |

Negative ROE across all quarters is a major concern, indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity investment.  The decrease in equity over time is also troubling.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind these trends.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake (SNOW) currently presents a high-risk investment. While the company shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins, its consistent negative EPS, negative ROE,  and significant underperformance against the S&P 500 are serious concerns.  The high beta and overbought RSI suggest further volatility is possible.  The extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is a critical red flag.  The inconsistencies in the provided earnings data require further investigation.  Before considering investment, a thorough due diligence process that addresses the points raised above is highly recommended.  The current data suggests the risk significantly outweighs the potential reward for long-term investors.
