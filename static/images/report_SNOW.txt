**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Snowflake's cumulative return (-2.05%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 24.00%.  The divergence is -26.1%, placing it at the 40.3rd percentile of historical divergence based on a range of -74.5% to 45.5%. This indicates that while significantly underperforming, its current underperformance isn't at an extreme historical level.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -46.0% | 70.5% | -46.0% | -0.1 | 48.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -33.0% | 70.5% | -49.0% | -0.0 | 66.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -13.0% | 73.9% | -33.0% | -0.0 | 51.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 39.0% | 73.9% | 20.0% | -0.1 | 56.0 |

The table shows significant negative CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)  and high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) from 2020 to 2023, indicating substantial periods of underperformance.  The negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market, and the high beta (especially in earlier periods) reflects significant market volatility.  However, a positive CAGR of 39% is projected for 2023-2025, suggesting a potential turnaround.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $167.66
* 5-Day Moving Average: $162.36
* 20-Day Moving Average: $148.49
* 60-Day Moving Average: $160.54

The price is above both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, while the 20-day average lag further behind indicating a stronger recent upward move.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* RSI: 75.31 (Overbought)
* PPO: 2.05 (Positive momentum)
* 20-Day Relative Strength Change: +1.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* Expected Return: -58.3% (Significant projected underperformance vs. S&P 500 over the long term)

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and susceptible to a correction.  The positive PPO indicates positive momentum, but the very negative expected return against the S&P 500 is a major concern.  The positive relative strength change supports the short-term upward momentum.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98  | $0.94 B        |
| 2024-08-29 | -0.95  | $0.87 B        |
| 2024-05-31 | -0.95  | $0.83 B        |
| 2023-12-01 | -0.65  | $0.73 B        |
| 2024-11-27 | -0.65  | $0.73 B        | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*

The company has reported negative EPS in recent quarters, indicating losses. Revenue is growing, but the rate of growth needs further analysis to assess its sustainability.  The duplicated entry suggests potential data inaccuracy.


**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was available. This lack of key financial information significantly limits the comprehensive analysis of the company's financial health and performance.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake (SNOW) currently shows significant underperformance against the S&P 500, with negative CAGR and high MDD in recent years. While recent price action suggests short-term upward momentum, technical indicators signal potential overbought conditions.  The negative EPS and lack of crucial financial data raise concerns about the company's profitability and financial health. The projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-58.3%) is a major risk factor.  Further investigation into the reasons for negative EPS and the acquisition of comprehensive financial data is crucial for a more thorough evaluation.  The positive projected CAGR for 2023-2025 warrants monitoring for a potential turnaround but should be viewed with caution due to the other indicators of underperformance.
