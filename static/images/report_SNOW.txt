## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  As of the last data point, SNOW's cumulative return is -6.84%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 72.27%.  The absolute divergence is -79.1%, placing it at the 19.4th percentile of historical divergence based on a range of -108.0% to 41.2%. This indicates SNOW's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is substantial, though not unprecedented historically.

The provided CAGR data shows inconsistent performance across the years, ranging from a substantial negative return (-39%) to a positive return of 31%. Alpha consistently remains around 0, suggesting the stock's performance is primarily driven by market movements (Beta is high, consistently around 56, indicating high market sensitivity).  The high beta reinforces the significant underperformance relative to the market benchmark (VOO) as the market (VOO) has performed strongly during the given period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $170.79
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $165.996
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $162.211
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $150.7315

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. However, the relatively small difference between the price and the 5-day moving average implies the upward trend might be weakening.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 60.75 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.24 – A positive value suggests a bullish trend, although it's relatively close to zero, indicating a weak bullish signal.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.0 – This shows a recent slight downward trend in relative performance against the market.
* **Expected Return:** -169% – This extremely negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 indicates significant concerns about future performance.  This figure needs further investigation to understand the basis of this prediction.
* **Price Change:** The recent price increase of $1.87 suggests a short-term upward trend (potentially a minor bounce), but it’s crucial to consider this in light of the negative long-term outlook.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent net losses (negative EPS) over the reported quarters, although revenue is steadily increasing. This suggests the company is experiencing revenue growth, but it's not translating into profitability.  Further investigation into operating expenses and other financial metrics is needed to ascertain the reason for this. The duplicated entry for 2024-11-27 needs clarification.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has fluctuated, and ROE (Return on Equity) is negative across all periods, suggesting the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital.  This needs further analysis to determine the underlying reasons.

|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B   | -11.07%   |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's performance is currently disappointing compared to the S&P 500.  While revenue is growing, consistent net losses and negative ROE raise serious concerns about long-term profitability. The high beta highlights its sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The negative long-term expected return is a significant red flag.  Further investigation is needed to determine the reasons for the negative EPS and ROE, and a thorough analysis of operating expenses and future growth prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions. The current short-term price increase should be viewed cautiously given the broader negative trends.  The duplicate earnings data requires clarification.
