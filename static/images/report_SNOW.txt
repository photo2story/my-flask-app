* **Closing Price:** $162.46
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $161.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $163.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $146.89

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Expected Return (-157.4%):** This extremely negative figure for expected return over a long-term period (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is highly concerning and warrants further investigation.  The extremely low value suggests a significant probability of underperforming the S&P 500 substantially over the long-term. This likely reflects the current high valuation and negative growth projections for SNOW.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth but is currently unprofitable with negative EPS and ROE.  The stock is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, and the projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is dramatically negative.  While the recent price action shows some short-term upward momentum, the underlying fundamentals raise serious concerns about its long-term prospects.  The high relative valuation and negative profitability make a long-term investment in SNOW appear very risky.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative EPS and ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests that significant improvement in the company's fundamentals and profitability is needed before it can be considered a worthwhile investment compared to a broad market index fund.
