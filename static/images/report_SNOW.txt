| 2024-01-31 | $5.18       | -3.27%       |

While equity has been fluctuating, the negative Return on Equity (ROE) is a significant concern, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital.  The fluctuations in equity between quarters need investigation.



**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins, but it's significantly underperforming the market and struggling with profitability on an EPS and ROE basis.  The high-risk indicators, negative expected return, and consistently negative alpha values signal caution.  The substantial negative cumulative return relative to the S&P 500 raises serious questions about the long-term viability of the investment, especially without a clear path to profitability despite growing revenue.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative EPS and fluctuating equity is crucial before considering an investment.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate dates in earnings) also demand clarification.
