**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of Total Revenue and Gross Profit data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing information significantly hinders a proper evaluation of SNOW's financial health and sustainability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SNOW is currently exhibiting concerning signals. While short-term price action shows some upward momentum, the long-term outlook is bearish.  The company is consistently posting negative earnings, while its performance lags significantly behind the S&P 500.  The high beta and overbought RSI suggest considerable risk.  The absence of key financial data further complicates a thorough assessment. The projected -58.3% long-term return against the S&P 500 highlights a major cause for concern for potential investors.  Further investigation into the company's financial statements and future projections is crucial before any investment decision is made.  The current data suggests SNOW is a high-risk investment with a potentially low return compared to the market.
