The extremely negative expected return is a major concern.

*   **Monitor Company News:** Stay updated on company announcements and industry developments.
*   **Re-evaluate Position:** If already holding SNOW, consider reducing your position based on your risk tolerance and investment horizon. The hybrid signal of cash_69%_Sell might be reasonable.
*   **Avoid New Positions (for now):** Unless there are clear signs of a turnaround in profitability and market performance, it might be prudent to avoid initiating new positions in SNOW.
*   **Further Research:** Conduct thorough research into Snowflake's growth strategy, competitive landscape, and path to profitability.
