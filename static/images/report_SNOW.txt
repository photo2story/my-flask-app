*   **5-day SMA:** 218.28
*   **20-day SMA:** 234.83
*   **60-day SMA:** 245.68

**Analysis:** The stock price is below its 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a potential short-term downtrend. The recent price increase compared to the previous close and the 5-day SMA might suggest a possible short-term rebound.

*   **Expected Return (%):** -40.2% (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. However, the RSI is approaching oversold territory, which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity if you believe in a rebound. The PPO confirms a downtrend. The Hybrid Signal recommends allocating a large amount of capital. The expected return is significantly negative, suggesting caution for long-term investment at the current price.  The recent divergence increase indicates a potential short-term bounce, but the overall long-term outlook is still concerning.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Snowflake exhibits strong revenue growth and high gross profit margins. However, the company is currently unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE. The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term rebound, but also highlight a downtrend. News sentiment is mixed, reflecting uncertainty about the company's future. While analysts generally have a "Buy" rating, there is a wide range in their target prices, indicating a lack of strong conviction. The high MDD indicates significant volatility. The negative alpha and beta close to zero raise concerns about Snowflake's performance compared to the market.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is warranted. While Snowflake has strong revenue growth potential and favorable analyst ratings, its unprofitability, recent underperformance, and market uncertainty create risks. A potential investment may be considered only if the investor has a high-risk tolerance, believes in the long-term growth story, and is prepared to hold the stock for an extended period despite potential further volatility. Close monitoring of Snowflake's progress towards profitability is crucial.
