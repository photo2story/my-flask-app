**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  As shown above, SNOW has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return difference of -75.5%.  The relative divergence of 21.4% suggests that while the underperformance is substantial, it's not historically unprecedented.  The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals consistently negative alpha across various periods, indicating underperformance against the market (beta values suggest high market sensitivity).  High beta values also suggest high volatility.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -34.0% | 25.5% | -0.1 | 47.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -8.0% | 25.5% | -0.1 | 65.7 |
| 2022-2024  | -21.0% | 25.5% | -0.1 | 51.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 11.0% | 14.2% | -0.4 | 52.3 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $158.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $156.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $161.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $169.98

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price increase (Last-market shows a $0.76 increase) is a small positive move compared to the overall downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.02 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.02 (Slightly positive, indicating a weak bullish signal)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.2 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -155.4% (This extremely negative expected return compared to S&P 500 over the long term needs further clarification and context.  It's likely an error or based on an extremely pessimistic scenario)

The relatively low RSI and slightly positive PPO, coupled with the recent price increase suggest a possible short-term bottoming, but the overall trend remains bearish, especially considering the significantly negative expected return. The -155.4% figure is concerning and requires further investigation to understand its derivation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98 | $0.94 B      |
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95 | $0.87 B      |
| 2024-05-31 | -$0.95 | $0.83 B      |
| 2023-12-01 | -$0.65 | $0.73 B      |
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65 | $0.73 B      | *(Likely a duplicate entry)*


Revenue is consistently increasing, but the company is still reporting negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  The duplicate entry for 2024-11-27 needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B | 65.94% |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B | 66.84% |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B | 67.12% |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B | 68.79% |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.73B | 68.82% |


Revenue shows consistent growth.  Profit margins are high, but this is likely due to the fact that  EPS is negative, skewing the margin calculation.  The actual profitability needs further investigation beyond profit margin alone.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B | -11.07% |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B | -7.67% |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B | -6.95% |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B | -3.27% |
| 2023-10-31 | $4.93B | -4.35% |


Negative ROE across all quarters further highlights the company's unprofitability, despite revenue growth.  Equity figures fluctuate which is worthy of investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth, but is currently unprofitable with consistently negative EPS and ROE.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bottom but not a clear reversal of the downtrend. The extremely negative long-term expected return (-155.4%) needs to be verified.  Investors should carefully consider the company's path to profitability before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation is needed into the data discrepancies (duplicate earnings entry) and the extremely low expected return figure before drawing definitive conclusions.
