| 2020-2022  | -44.0% | 21.1% | -0.0 | 47.5 |

| 2023-2025  | 30.0% | 11.8% | -0.4 | 61.7 |

**Analysis:** The table shows significant negative CAGRs for several periods indicating substantial losses. The high beta consistently underscores the stock's sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The consistently negative alpha signifies underperformance against the market benchmark.  The last year shows a positive CAGR, however this is still needs to be considered alongside the earlier negative results.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($186.37) is above the 5-day ($185.69), 20-day ($175.39), and 60-day ($164.63) moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The last market data shows a slight increase of $0.19, indicating a minor upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (69.35):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered >70), suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (0.51):** Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+2.9):** Shows a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-133.4%):** This indicates a significant negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is a very concerning figure.

The minor price increase reflected in the `Last-market` data does not significantly alter the overall negative outlook given the large negative expected return.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake (SNOW) exhibits a concerning performance profile.  Despite revenue growth, persistent negative EPS and ROE, combined with significant underperformance against the S&P 500 (as evidenced by the negative alpha and vastly lower cumulative return) create a highly negative outlook.  While short-term price movements show a slight uptrend, the long-term prospects appear weak given the projected negative expected return.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative EPS and ROE is crucial before considering any investment.  The data suggests significant risk associated with investing in SNOW at this time.  The duplicate data entry also highlights the need for more thorough data verification.
