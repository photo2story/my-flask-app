2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the SNOW (Snowflake Inc.) data, along with analysis.

**Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Overview:** Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing company.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (SNOW vs. VOO):**

*   **SNOW Cumulative Return:** 25.42%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 54.44%
*   **Divergence:** -29.0 (Relative Divergence: 33.9)

**Analysis:** SNOW has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period considered. The divergence of -29% indicates a substantial difference in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 33.9 suggests that the current divergence is towards the lower end of its historical range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -27.0% | 82.4% | -55.0% | 2.0  | 68.1   |
| 2022-2024  | -44.0% | 82.4% | -74.0% | 2.0  | 52.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 40.0%  | 81.0% | -28.0% | 1.7  | 75.1   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows very volatile returns. 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 show negative annual growth, while 2023-2025 show high growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High maximum drawdowns consistently above 80% indicate high risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha suggests that SNOW has underperformed relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Betas around 2 indicate SNOW is significantly more volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** The capitalization of Snowflake has fluctuated, peaking at 75.1B in 2023-2025.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 219.36
*   **Previous Close:** 222.05
*   **Change:** -1.21
*   **5-day SMA:** 222.024
*   **20-day SMA:** 224.473
*   **60-day SMA:** 244.5495

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three simple moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This *generally* suggests a short-term downtrend.  The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, further reinforcing this short-term bearish sentiment. The small change may signify a very small amount of volatility for the day.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Other Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 53.45
*   **PPO:** 0.333
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 90% of cash (4 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-03)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.5 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the underperformance and high volatility, the MRI suggests a 'High Investment Recommended.'  This seems contradictory and warrants careful consideration.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 53.45 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.333 shows the short term is slightly above the long term average price, indicating a small possible buying point.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests buying a significant portion of cash.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence aligns with the short-term downtrend indicated by the moving averages.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 0.0% is concerning, suggesting no anticipated outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance):**

*   **Positive:**
    *   The Motley Fool predicting Snowflake could beat Palantir in 2026 and calling it a great time to buy.
    *   Raymond James assuming coverage with an "Outperform" rating.
    *   Zacks highlighting Snowflake's growing customer base and potential upside.
    *   Allspring Global Investments Holdings LLC increased its stock holdings in Snowflake.
*   **Neutral/Negative:**
    *   Discussion of Q3 earnings and acquisition rumors (depending on the context of the rumors, this could be either positive or negative).
    *   "Insider sale filings surface," suggesting potential concerns from insiders about the company's future prospects.
    *   The stock slipped under $220, indicating some recent selling pressure.

**Analysis:** Recent news presents a mixed picture. Several positive analyst ratings and articles suggest optimism about Snowflake's future, while insider selling and price declines raise some concerns.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.59 (~Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 47
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 283.52 / 500.00 / 170.00

**Analysis:**  Analyst consensus is strongly positive, with a "Buy" rating and a mean rating close to "Strong Buy." The average target price of $283.52 suggests significant upside potential from the current price of $219.36. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices (500.00 - 170.00) indicates a considerable degree of uncertainty among analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue    |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-12-05 | -0.87 | 1.21 B$    |
| 2025-09-05 | -0.89 | 1.14 B$    |
| 2025-05-30 | -1.29 | 1.04 B$    |
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98 | 0.94 B$    |
| 2025-12-05 | -0.98 | 0.94 B$    |

**Analysis:** Snowflake is consistently reporting negative EPS (Earnings Per Share), indicating a lack of profitability. While revenue is growing quarter-over-quarter, the consistent losses are a concern. The duplicate entry for 2025-12-05 with differing EPS and revenue figures should be verified.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-10-31   | $1.21B  | 67.77%        |
| 2025-07-31   | $1.14B  | 67.53%        |
| 2025-04-30   | $1.04B  | 66.53%        |
| 2025-01-31   | $0.99B  | 66.23%        |
| 2024-10-31   | $0.94B  | 65.94%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity | ROE      |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| 2025-10-31   | $2.13B | -13.78%  |
| 2025-07-31   | $2.37B | -12.56%  |
| 2025-04-30   | $2.41B | -17.86%  |
| 2025-01-31   | $3.00B | -10.92%  |
| 2024-10-31   | $2.93B | -11.07%  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is consistently growing, and the profit margin is remarkably high. This indicates strong demand for Snowflake's services and efficient operations. The business model seems extremely robust.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has decreased, and the ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, reflecting the net losses despite the revenue growth and high profit margin. This signifies that the company is not efficiently generating profits from its equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Snowflake (SNOW) presents a mixed investment picture.

*   **Positives:** Strong revenue growth, high profit margins, positive analyst ratings, and some optimistic news headlines.
*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative EPS and ROE, high volatility (high Beta and MDD), recent price declines, insider selling, and a neutral/negative short-term trend. The MRI shows that the return is not risk-adjusted.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The high MRI is contradicted by many other data points. Given the high volatility, negative profitability metrics, and the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, a cautious approach is warranted. The recent downtrend and insider selling add to the concerns. While positive analyst ratings and revenue growth are encouraging, it is not enough to suggest a buy.

A "Hold" or even "Reduce" position might be more appropriate for existing investors. Potential new investors should carefully weigh the risks and potential rewards and consider waiting for more positive signals, such as a consistent return to profitability. The discrepancy between revenue growth and profitability needs to be addressed.
