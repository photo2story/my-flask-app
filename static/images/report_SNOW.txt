**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's strong revenue growth is overshadowed by persistent unprofitability and significant underperformance against the S&P 500. The high beta indicates substantial volatility. While short-term technical indicators show a positive trend, the negative long-term expected return and historical performance raise serious concerns. The -160.2% expected return figure is highly unusual and likely requires clarification or correction.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy needs careful consideration given the significant risks involved.  Further investigation into the reasons for the consistent losses and the extremely negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current price surge may be short-lived and speculative.  The data suggests a high-risk, high-reward scenario, but currently leans heavily towards the risk side.
