**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO) Comparison:**

*   **SNOW Company Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing company.
*   **SNOW Cumulative Return:** 26.12%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 52.94%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current Divergence: -26.8
    *   Relative Divergence: 36.1
*   **Analysis:** SNOW has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period considered. The negative divergence of -26.8 indicates that SNOW's returns are substantially lower than the market benchmark. A relative divergence of 36.1 means it's located in the bottom part of the past divergence data.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**
    *   **General Trend:** The provided data shows a concerning trend across different three-year periods. CAGR is negative in earlier periods and shows very recent recovery, MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, and Alpha is consistently negative.
    *   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha suggests that SNOW has underperformed relative to its risk (Beta) compared to the market.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values around 0 to 0.1 indicate that the stock's price is less sensitive to market movements.
    *   **CAGR & MDD:** Very recent CAGR recovery but still high MDD indicating significant volatility and risk.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $220.59

    *   20-day SMA: $237.87
    *   60-day SMA: $245.71
*   **Analysis:** SNOW's price experienced a small positive change in the last market. The fact that the current price is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs suggests a short-term and medium-term downtrend, with the 5 day SMA slightly below the current price.

    *   The negative PPO indicates that the stock is in a downtrend.
    *   The Hybrid Signal recommending buying 90% of cash for 4 shares is marked as 'Safe' with an MRI of 0.8, indicating that there is a high conviction of short term gains and low risk according to the model.
    *   The recent increase in relative divergence indicates a potential short-term upward trend.
    *   The very negative Expected Return is a major red flag, suggesting significant potential losses if held long-term.
