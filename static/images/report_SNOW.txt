**3) Index Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 25.98 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.50

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** 4.6 (+), suggesting a short-term increase
*   **Expected Return:** -40.2%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests moderate risk-reward balance.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI of 25.98 indicates that SNOW is currently in oversold territory, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity. *However*, oversold conditions can persist for extended periods, especially in a downtrend.
    *   **PPO:** The PPO is negative, indicating that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, which usually signals a downtrend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a buy signal with most of the available capital, indicating a bullish outlook.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend, potentially due to the oversold conditions.
    *   **Expected Return:**  A *negative* expected return of -40.2% is very concerning. This suggests that, based on the model used, long-term investment in SNOW from this point is projected to result in significant losses compared to the S&P 500.  This is a strong warning sign.
    *   **Large Price Change:** The price change of 0.52 is relatively small. This suggests that while there has been some fluctuation, it does not indicate a sharp rebound or decline.

*   **Negatives:**
    *   SNOW is significantly underperforming the S&P 500.
    *   The company is not yet profitable, with consistent negative EPS.
    *   The negative expected return of -40.2% is a major red flag.

    *   High volatility, indicated by large MDD.

**Overall Assessment:**

While SNOW exhibits some positive financial attributes like revenue growth and high profit margins, the lack of profitability, underperformance relative to the market, negative expected return, and concerns about future outlook raise significant risks. The analyst consensus is still positive, but the mixed news coverage and the market's negative reaction to the latest earnings suggest caution.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a **neutral to slightly negative** outlook on SNOW is warranted. Potential investors should carefully weigh the potential upside (revenue growth, analyst target prices) against the significant risks (lack of profitability, negative expected return, competitive pressures). It's crucial to monitor the company's progress toward profitability and its ability to maintain revenue growth in the face of increased competition. Further research and due diligence are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
