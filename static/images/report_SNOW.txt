**2. Recent Price Movement:**

| Metric             | Value      |
|----------------------|------------|
| Closing Price       | $171.35    |
| 5-Day Moving Average | $136.82    |
| 20-Day Moving Average | $124.51    |
| 60-Day Moving Average | $117.75    |

The closing price is significantly above the short-term and medium-term moving averages, indicating a recent price surge. The last market price of $167.78 also suggests a recent upward trend, although still below the closing price which could reflect after-hours trading.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

| Indicator                     | Value  | Interpretation                                  |
|------------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| RSI                          | 86.54  | Overbought; suggests potential price correction |
| PPO                          | 2.64   | Positive; indicates upward momentum            |
| 20-Day Relative Divergence  | +16.78 | Strong recent upward movement                   |
| Expected Return (2+ years)   | 0.0%   | No significant outperformance expected vs. VOO |

The high RSI value suggests the stock may be overbought, increasing the risk of a price correction. The positive PPO and significant positive relative divergence suggest recent strong upward momentum. However, the expected return of 0% suggests that long-term outperformance against the S&P 500 is not anticipated. The substantial jump from the last market price to the closing price ($167.78 to $171.35)  indicates a possible sudden upward movement, possibly driven by news or market sentiment. This warrants further investigation.
