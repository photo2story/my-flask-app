* **5-day Moving Average:** 181.10
* **20-day Moving Average:** 159.10
* **60-day Moving Average:** 130.60

The price is below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.  The gap between the last market price (174.75) and the closing price (171.55) suggests a minor recent downturn.

The high RSI coupled with a negative PPO and negative relative strength divergence indicates a bearish outlook.  The closing price being lower than the last market price (174.75) doesn't suggest a significant sudden drop; however, further price action should be monitored.
