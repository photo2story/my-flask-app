    *   Analysis of Alpha, Beta table:

The table displays the Alpha, Beta analysis for Snowflake Inc (SNOW) over different periods, along with other metrics such as Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), and Market Capitalization (Cap). Here's a breakdown of what these metrics mean and what the table indicates:

Metrics Explanation:

CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate): The annual rate of return that would be required for an investment to grow from its initial to its final value, assuming the profits were reinvested at the end of each year of the investment’s term.
MDD (Maximum Drawdown): The maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, before a new peak is attained. MDD is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period.
Alpha: A measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis. Alpha takes the volatility (price risk) of a security or portfolio and compares its risk-adjusted performance to a benchmark index. The excess return relative to the return of the benchmark is the portfolio’s alpha.
Beta: A measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the market. A beta of less than 1 indicates that the stock is less volatile than the market, and a beta greater than 1 indicates that the stock is more volatile than the market.
Cap (Market Capitalization): The total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. In this table, it is represented in billions (B).
Analysis of the Provided Data:

Performance Over Different Periods:

2020-2022:
CAGR: -25.0% suggests a significant annual loss over this period.
MDD: 75.3% indicates a high level of downside risk.
Alpha: -9.0% shows underperformance relative to the benchmark, indicating that the stock's return was less than expected given its risk.
Beta: 0.0 suggests that the stock’s price is virtually uncorrelated with the market during this period.
Market Cap: 42.0B.
2021-2023:
CAGR: Remains at -25.0%, indicating sustained losses.
MDD: Increased slightly to 78.3%, showing higher downside risk.
Alpha: -27.0% indicates even more significant underperformance relative to the benchmark.
Beta: 0.1 suggests a very low correlation with the market.
Market Cap: 58.2B.
2022-2024:
CAGR: -26.0%, continuing the trend of annual losses.
MDD: Still high at 78.3%, indicating persistent downside risk.
Alpha: -46.0% further underscores the underperformance.
Beta: 0.1 remains low, suggesting minimal correlation with the market.
Market Cap: 45.1B.
2023-2025:
CAGR: A significant turnaround to 73.0%, indicating substantial growth.
MDD: High at 79.8%, indicating persistent downside risk.
Alpha: 7.0% shows outperformance relative to the benchmark.
Beta: -0.0 suggests a virtually uncorrelated or inverse relationship with the market.
Market Cap: 77.5B.
Implications:

Volatility and Risk: High MDD values across all periods indicate that the stock has a high degree of downside risk.
Market Correlation: Low Beta values suggest that SNOW’s stock price is not closely tied to overall market movements, which could be beneficial in a downturn but might also mean it doesn’t fully participate in market rallies.
Alpha Performance: The negative Alpha values for the periods from 2020-2024 highlight that the stock underperformed relative to its risk level when compared to the benchmark. However, the positive Alpha from 2023-2025 shows a recent trend of outperformance.
Overall Assessment:

The data paints a picture of a highly volatile stock with periods of significant underperformance followed by a recent turnaround. The negative CAGR and high MDD in earlier periods suggest substantial risk, while the positive CAGR and Alpha in the 2023-2025 period indicate a potential shift in the stock’s performance. Investors should consider this volatility and the potential for large drawdowns when making investment decisions.
