**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake is currently experiencing a period of significant underperformance compared to the broader market, as evidenced by its negative cumulative return and large divergence from the S&P 500. While revenue growth is positive, consistent negative EPS and negative ROE raise serious concerns about profitability and long-term sustainability.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the high market risk and bearish signals suggest caution. The provided -71.6% expected return is highly suspect and requires thorough review and justification.  Before considering any investment, a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals, including its growth strategy and path to profitability, is crucial.  A long-term, dollar-cost averaging approach might be considered if the investor believes in the long-term potential of the company, despite its current challenges.  However, given the high risk and uncertainty, it's recommended to proceed with caution.
