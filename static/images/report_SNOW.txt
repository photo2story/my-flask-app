## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  The provided data reveals significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), marked by negative cumulative returns and concerning financial metrics.  Further analysis is needed to determine the long-term viability and investment potential.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** SNOW: -5.25%, VOO: 66.77%.  SNOW significantly underperformed VOO by 72 percentage points. This places it at the 24.1th percentile of its historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (relative to a historical range from -108% to +41%).

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided table shows consistently negative alpha values across the analyzed periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market.  The high and fluctuating beta values suggest high volatility and significant market sensitivity.  Specifically, the company's returns move more drastically than the market as a whole.

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -44.0%  | 21.1%  | -0.0   | 47.4   |       |
| 2021-2023  | -7.0%   | 21.1%  | -0.1   | 65.7   |       |
| 2022-2024  | -19.0%  | 21.1%  | -0.1   | 51.0   |       |
| 2023-2025  | 23.0%   | 11.8%  | -0.4   | 57.3   |       |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $173.69
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $170.58
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $182.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $173.64

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend. The recent price increase (Last-market shows 4.51 increase from previous close) may indicate short-term volatility, and further observation is needed to confirm any trend reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.16 (approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so)
* **PPO:** -1.65 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +2.0 (suggests short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -131.2% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a serious concern and warrants further investigation of the methodology used to derive this estimate.)  The large price increase from the previous closing price might partially explain the high negative expected return, showing short-term price fluctuations could cause misleading long-term projections.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has reported consistent negative EPS over the past few quarters, indicating ongoing losses. Revenue is growing, but at a slower pace than previous quarters; however the growth in revenue may be insufficient to compensate for rising expenses and overall negative earnings.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98  | $0.94 B      |
| 2024-08-29 | -0.95  | $0.87 B      |
| 2024-05-31 | -0.95  | $0.83 B      |
| 2023-12-01 | -0.65  | $0.73 B      |
| 2024-11-27 | -0.65  | $0.73 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is growing steadily, showing positive signs. However, profit margins are declining slightly, suggesting that increasing costs might be affecting profitability.  The negative ROE across all periods is very concerning, demonstrating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B  | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B  | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B  | 67.12%        |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B  | 68.79%        |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.73B  | 68.82%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity  | ROE       |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B  | -11.07%   |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B  | -7.67%    |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B  | -6.95%    |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B  | -3.27%    |
| 2023-10-31 | $4.93B  | -4.35%    |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's performance relative to the S&P 500 is significantly poor.  While revenue is growing, persistent negative EPS, declining profit margins, and deeply negative ROE raise serious concerns about the company's long-term financial health.  The high negative expected return further underscores the significant risk involved.  The recent price increase is a short-term fluctuation and not a guaranteed shift towards long-term growth.  More detailed financial statement analysis and a thorough evaluation of the methodology behind the -131.2% expected return are crucial before making any investment decisions.  Investors should carefully consider the substantial risks associated with SNOW before making any investment.
