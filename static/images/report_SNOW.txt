## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

SNOW's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The stock shows high volatility and negative alpha, suggesting underperformance relative to the market. Recent price action indicates a short-term upward trend, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain given negative expected returns.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.

* **Cumulative Return:** SNOW: -2.05%; VOO: 24.00%
* **Return Difference:** SNOW underperformed VOO by approximately 26.1 percentage points.  The relative divergence is 40.3% based on the provided historical range.

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals consistent negative alpha across the periods considered (2020-2025), indicating consistent underperformance relative to the market benchmark. The high beta values (48.0-66.5) highlight SNOW's significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The CAGR is consistently negative except for 2023-2025, which shows positive growth but is potentially unsustainable based on other indicators.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $162.36
* **20-day Moving Average:** $148.49
* **60-day Moving Average:** $160.54

The recent price of $167.66 shows a significant move above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a recent short-term upward trend.  However, it is still below the 60-day moving average, indicating the upward trend isn't yet fully established. The price increase from the previous close ($1.39) is notable.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 75.31 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 2.05 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** 1.9 (+), short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -58.3% (Long-term negative expected return relative to the market)


The high RSI value suggests the stock may be overbought, increasing the risk of a price correction. While the PPO indicates positive momentum, the negative expected return highlights the need for caution.  The recent price surge should be viewed within the context of the overall negative long-term outlook.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98 | $0.94B        |
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95 | $0.87B        |
| 2024-05-31 | -$0.95 | $0.83B        |
| 2023-12-01 | -$0.65 | $0.73B        |
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65 | $0.73B        |


The data shows consistent negative EPS over the reported quarters, indicating ongoing losses. While revenue is growing, the company is not yet profitable.  The repetition of the -$0.65 and $0.73B figures in November 2023 and November 2024 should be investigated for potential data entry errors.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $0.99B  | 66.23%       |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B  | 65.94%       |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B  | 66.84%       |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B  | 67.12%       |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B  | 68.79%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE       |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2025-01-31 | $3.00B  | -10.92%    |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B  | -11.07%    |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B  | -7.67%     |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B  | -6.95%     |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B  | -3.27%     |

Revenue is steadily increasing, showing positive growth.  However, the consistently high profit margin doesn't translate into positive ROE, which remains negative across all reported quarters, indicating potential issues with the company's capital structure or efficiency.  The fluctuation in equity also warrants further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins. However, it is currently unprofitable and significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The negative expected return, high beta, and overbought RSI suggest high risk.  While the recent price action indicates a short-term upward trend, the underlying fundamentals raise concerns.  Further analysis is needed to ascertain the reasons for the negative EPS, fluctuating equity, and negative ROE before considering any investment. The provided data suggests a high-risk investment with potential for significant losses, particularly in the long term.  The negative long-term expected return compared to VOO strongly advises against long-term investment in SNOW at the current time based on this data.  Corrective action or substantial shifts in the fundamentals are necessary to improve the outlook.
