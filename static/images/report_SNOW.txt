**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  As of the last data point provided, SNOW's cumulative return is -31.38%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 74.99%. This represents a significant divergence of -106.37%.

|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -43.5%  | 62.3%   | -67.1% | 1.9   | 48.1   |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $130.24
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $128.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $120.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $116.53

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  However, given the long-term negative performance, this should be interpreted cautiously.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 64.83 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.79 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 4.92 (+)  (Short-term upward trend relative to the S&P 500)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This is a significant concern.  The provided data suggests no expectation of outperforming the S&P 500 over the long term.)

The current price of $130.24, while above the moving averages, doesn't necessarily indicate a sharp rebound or decline, but given the long-term underperformance, caution is advised. The 0.0% expected return highlights a major risk, especially concerning the long-term outlook of outperforming the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent negative EPS and a relatively flat revenue growth, indicating persistent profitability challenges for SNOW. The recent quarter shows no significant change in the EPS or revenue trend. Further analysis of revenue and profit margin is necessary to determine the reasons for consistent negative EPS.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95  | $0.87 B     |
| 2024-05-31 | -$0.95  | $0.83 B     |
| 2023-12-01 | -$0.65  | $0.73 B     |
| 2023-08-31 | -$0.69  | $0.67 B     |
| 2023-08-31 | -$0.69  | $0.67 B     |


**5.  Additional Financial Information:**

**1) Revenue and Profitability:**  The revenue is growing, but profit margin has fluctuated but remains relatively high.  This needs more detailed analysis. The high profit margin doesn't translate to positive EPS which is alarming.

**2) Capital and Profitability:**  Negative ROE consistently across all quarters is a major red flag, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  While short-term indicators suggest a potential upward trend, the consistent negative EPS, negative ROE, and the overall negative CAGR over multiple years paint a concerning picture.  The high beta indicates significant volatility.  The lack of expected return for long-term investment against the S&P 500 is a major red flag.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons for the persistent negative EPS despite a relatively high profit margin and growing revenue.  A thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a more complete assessment.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is recommended. While the high-profit margins are intriguing, the negative EPS and ROE across multiple quarters raise serious concerns about the company's long-term financial health and sustainability.  Before making any investment decisions, it is critical to conduct further research, including a detailed analysis of the company's financials, an assessment of the competitive landscape, and a thorough review of recent news and analyst reports to understand the reasons behind the negative performance and potential future prospects.  The lack of a positive expected return compared to the S&P 500, despite a seemingly robust revenue stream, necessitates significant due diligence.
