**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Recent Trend:** The stock is currently trading below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential downward trend.

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** At 0.7, the MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** An RSI of 32.09 indicates that the stock is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, *but it could also mean the stock is trending downwards.*
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** A negative PPO of -1.27 suggests a downward trend as the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average.

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** "0.1 (+): 단기상승" indicates a short-term upward trend in relative divergence.
*   **Expected Return:** A negative expected return of -39.8% is concerning. This suggests that, based on the models used, the stock is projected to underperform significantly over the next two years compared to the S&P 500.
