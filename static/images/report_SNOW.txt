**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  The provided data reveals a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  The cumulative return difference of -74.8% highlights this substantial lag.  The alpha/beta analysis further confirms this underperformance.  Negative alpha values consistently indicate underperformance relative to the market benchmark, while the high beta values (47.4 - 65.7) suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows inconsistent performance, ranging from -44% to 27%, reflecting the stock's volatility.  Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) are also significant, ranging from 21.1% to 51%, indicating substantial price declines during specific periods.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $181.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $170.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $160.10

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day MA indicates limited recent momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Divergence:**

The RSI of 71.99 is approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction.  The positive PPO (0.64) indicates bullish momentum, but this should be viewed in conjunction with the RSI and the overall underperformance. The 20-day relative divergence of +4.3 points to a recent short-term uptrend.  The large positive change in price (+$1.24) suggests a recent upward price movement.

Equity fluctuates, and the negative ROE consistently indicates that the company is not generating profits on its shareholders' equity. This is a significant concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth, but this is not translating into profitability.  The stock's significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, coupled with negative EPS, negative ROE, and high volatility, presents a concerning picture. While short-term indicators suggest some positive momentum, the long-term outlook appears uncertain, especially given the projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-142.4%). Further investigation into the reasons for the negative EPS and ROE, and a deeper analysis of the company's growth strategy are crucial before making any investment decisions. The high beta signifies that investing in SNOW involves significant risk.  A long-term investment strategy should carefully consider these factors.
