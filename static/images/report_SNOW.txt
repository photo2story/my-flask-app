## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

**0) Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Snowflake's cumulative return of -24.63% significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 48.87%.  The difference is a substantial -73.5 percentage points.  Considering the provided range of historical divergence (max: 33.6%, min: -98.7%), the current -73.5% divergence places SNOW at the 19th percentile relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently negative alpha values across the analyzed periods, indicating Snowflake underperformed the market (represented by the benchmark used for the alpha calculation).  The high beta values (48.8 to 67.6) suggest high volatility and significant sensitivity to market movements.  The market capitalization also fluctuates considerably.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $146.16
* **Last Market Price:** $148.72 (a $1.75 increase from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $155.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $157.18
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $169.70

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.75 could be a temporary bounce.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.26 (Slightly below neutral; not oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.14 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.7 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -157.8% (This extremely negative figure needs further clarification. It's likely referencing a worst-case scenario or a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) given the current trajectory).  This should be examined carefully.  The recent price increase of $1.75 is not significant enough to warrant a "sudden rebound" designation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  While revenue is growing, the company is not yet profitable, and its high beta suggests substantial market risk.  Technical indicators point towards a bearish trend.  The extremely negative expected return requires further investigation to clarify its calculation methodology.  Long-term investment decisions should carefully consider the company's persistent losses despite revenue growth, high volatility, and the substantial underperformance relative to the market.  A thorough due diligence, including a deeper dive into the -157.8% expected return figure, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
