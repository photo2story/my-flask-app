## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Snowflake Inc. (SNOW), a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company, based on the provided financial and market data.  We will examine its performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key indicators, earnings, and financial health.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Snowflake's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's.

* **SNOW Cumulative Return:** -19.08%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 50.23%
* **Return Difference:** -69.3%  This indicates SNOW underperformed VOO considerably.  The relative divergence of -22.2% places its performance in the lower 22.2 percentile compared to its historical range (-98.7% to 33.6%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows negative alpha values across all periods, indicating Snowflake underperformed the market benchmark. High beta values (44.4 - 61.5) suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The consistently negative CAGR also reflects underperformance.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -32.0%   | 57.0%   | -0.0    | 44.4    |        |
| 2021-2023  | -7.0%    | 57.0%   | -0.0    | 61.5    |        |
| 2022-2024  | -17.0%   | 67.7%   | -0.1    | 47.8    |        |
| 2023-2025  | 5.0%     | 67.7%   | -0.1    | 48.6    |        |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $156.98
* **Last Market Price:** $145.23 (a -$3.58 decrease from the previous close of $150.63) This represents a recent sharp drop.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $160.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $159.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $169.91

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent significant drop warrants further investigation.

* **RSI:** 47.71 (Approaching oversold territory but not yet there)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -128.4% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and needs further explanation.)

The conflicting signals from the indicators (positive PPO but negative price action and expected return) highlight the uncertainty surrounding SNOW's future performance. The significant price drop needs to be analyzed further to determine the underlying causes.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Snowflake continues to report losses despite increasing revenue. While revenue is growing, the company is not yet profitable.  The consistent negative EPS is a key concern.

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98   | $0.94 B     |
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95   | $0.87 B     |
| 2024-05-31 | -$0.95   | $0.83 B     |
| 2023-12-01 | -$0.65   | $0.73 B     |
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65   | $0.73 B     |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue growth is positive, but profitability is a major concern.  Profit margins are high, but the negative ROE across most quarters indicates the company is not generating returns on its equity. This needs further investigation to determine the cause.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $0.99B     | 66.23%        |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B     | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B     | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B     | 67.12%        |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B     | 68.79%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE          |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $3.00B     | -10.92%       |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B     | -11.07%       |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B     | -7.67%        |

| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B     | -3.27%        |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's performance is currently underwhelming. While it shows revenue growth, it's plagued by consistent losses and a negative ROE, indicating issues with profitability and return on investment.  The high beta suggests significant market risk. The recent sharp price drop further exacerbates the negative outlook.  The extremely negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 requires clarification and further investigation into the underlying assumptions. A long-term investment strategy should carefully consider these factors and monitor the company's progress towards profitability.  Further analysis is needed to understand the causes of the recent price drop and the extremely negative expected return figure.  More in-depth research into the company's strategy and competitive landscape is recommended before making any investment decisions.
