**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  Over the past few years, SNOW significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return significantly below VOO. The provided data shows a substantial gap of -27.4% between SNOW's and VOO's cumulative returns as of the last data point.  The relative divergence of 39.2% indicates that SNOW's performance is at the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high beta values (48.0-66.5), indicating significant sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Negative alpha values consistently suggest underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  While CAGR shows improvement from -46% to 34%, high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values show considerable volatility.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -46.0% | 70.5% | -0.1 | 48.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -33.0% | 70.5% | -0.0 | 66.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -13.0% | 73.9% | -0.0 | 51.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 34.0% | 73.9% | -0.1 | 53.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $158.66
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $145.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $144.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $162.77

The recent price of $158.66 is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, hinting at potential resistance levels. The significant one-day price increase of $7.65 indicates a sudden positive shift in market sentiment.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 63.25 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.26 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -60.4% (Significant underperformance relative to S&P 500 expected)

The relatively high RSI suggests potential for a price correction.  The positive PPO reinforces the short-term upward trend observed in the moving averages. However, the significantly negative expected return highlights the substantial risk associated with long-term investment in SNOW compared to the S&P 500. The large price jump needs further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Snowflake consistently reports negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  Revenue is growing, but at a slower pace than expected considering the current stock price and high valuation.  The consistent negative EPS is a major concern.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98 | $0.94 B      |
| 2024-08-29 | -0.95 | $0.87 B      |
| 2024-05-31 | -0.95 | $0.83 B      |
| 2023-12-01 | -0.65 | $0.73 B      |
| 2024-11-27 | -0.65 | $0.73 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial statements show strong revenue growth with relatively high profit margins. However, the negative ROE is troubling, suggesting that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  The significant drop in equity from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024 is also a cause for concern.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $0.99B | 66.23% |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B | 65.94% |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B | 66.84% |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B | 67.12% |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B | 68.79% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE      |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 2025-01-31 | $3.00B | -10.92% |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B | -11.07% |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B | -7.67%  |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B | -6.95%  |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B | -3.27%  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's recent price surge needs further investigation. While revenue shows growth and profit margins are healthy, consistent negative EPS and ROE raise serious concerns about its long-term profitability.  The high beta indicates high market sensitivity, and the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 suggests considerable investment risk.  The negative expected return further emphasizes the potential for substantial losses compared to a diversified market index fund.  Given the current data, the risk-reward profile of SNOW appears unfavorable for long-term investors.  Further due diligence, including a deeper analysis of the recent price jump and future earnings expectations, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
