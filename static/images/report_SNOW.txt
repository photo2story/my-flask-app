*   **5-day Moving Average:** 230.93
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 225.62
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 215.03

*   **Analysis:** The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an uptrend. However, the negative change in the last market data indicates a recent pullback.  The price closing significantly lower than the previous close (-3.18) is a bearish signal and warrants attention.

**3. Indicators & Signals**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 57.87 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.33 (Positive - Slightly bullish, suggesting short-term momentum is positive relative to longer-term momentum)

*   **Expected Return:** -23.2% (Long-term underperformance projection vs. S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:**  The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. The RSI being near 50 confirms the buy signal. The hybrid signal indicating a "Buy" recommendation reinforces this sentiment. However, the negative expected return suggests that, despite short-term positive signals, long-term projections are not as optimistic relative to the S&P 500. The +3.9 in recent relative deviation suggests that Snowflake has been outperforming the S\&P 500 recently, which confirms the buy signal.

Given the MRI of 0.9, the buy hybrid signal and the positive change in relative deviation, a **medium investment** is indicated.
