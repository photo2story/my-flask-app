**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Snowflake has consistently reported negative EPS over the past several quarters, although revenue is growing.  The consistent losses are a matter of concern.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98   | $0.94 B     |
| 2024-08-29 | -0.95   | $0.87 B     |
| 2024-05-31 | -0.95   | $0.83 B     |
| 2023-12-01 | -0.65   | $0.73 B     |
| 2024-11-27 | -0.65   | $0.73 B     | *(duplicate entry)*


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is growing steadily, showing positive trajectory. However, the profit margins, while high, are not translating into positive ROE. The negative ROE across all quarters indicates the company is not generating returns on its equity.  The decreasing equity from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024 is also a significant concern.


| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity  | ROE      |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------|----------|
| 2024-10-31  | $0.94B   | 65.94%        | $2.93B  | -11.07%  |
| 2024-07-31  | $0.87B   | 66.84%        | $4.13B  | -7.67%   |
| 2024-04-30  | $0.83B   | 67.12%        | $4.56B  | -6.95%   |
| 2024-01-31  | $0.77B   | 68.79%        | $5.18B  | -3.27%   |
| 2023-10-31  | $0.73B   | 68.82%        | $4.93B  | -4.35%   |



**6) Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake (SNOW) is currently showing significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While revenue is increasing, the company is not profitable,  demonstrated by consistently negative EPS and ROE.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, and the exceptionally negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises serious concerns.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers behind the negative expected return and whether the current valuation reflects the risks inherent in the company's financial performance.  A long-term investment decision should only be made after a thorough assessment of these risks and careful consideration of alternative investment opportunities.  The negative ROE in particular is a significant red flag.
