| 2023-2025  | 73.0%    | 79.8%    | 7.0%     | -0.0   | 77.5   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:**  Snowflake has experienced significant volatility. While the 2023-2025 period shows strong growth (73.0%), previous periods show substantial declines.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The high MDD figures across all periods (around 75-80%) indicate significant risk and volatility.
    *   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are largely negative, particularly in recent periods (-46%), indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark.  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows positive alpha, but it's important to see if this trend continues.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 265.11
*   **Last Market Close:** Price 228.79, Previous Close 234.77, Change -2.55

*   **20-day SMA:** 256.64
*   **60-day SMA:** 246.01

*   **Analysis:** The current price is significantly above the last market close and lower than all moving averages. The 5-day SMA is slightly above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term upward trend, but the last market close shows potential volatility. The discrepancy between the current price and last market close suggests a significant price movement outside of regular trading hours.

*   **RSI:** 46.90 (Neutral - Neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.19 (Positive - suggesting a slight upward trend in momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (4 shares - Safe) - Suggests a strong buy signal based on the indicators, potentially due to the high MRI.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -6.9 (Decreasing) - Short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -22.2% - Suggests a negative expected return compared to current levels, even in the long term, and also relative to S&P500.
*   **Last Market Close Fluctuation:** The price change from the previous close (-2.55) suggests some downward pressure.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Headlines point to mixed sentiment:**
    *   Some articles question if earnings beat is enough to lift the stock, while others focus on Snowflake vs. Palantir valuation.
    *   Motley Fool mentions SNOW as a market mover, while Benzinga highlights the stock's recent plunge.
    *   Zacks discusses Snowflake as a potential buy ahead of earnings (contradictory as the 2025-12-05 data already shows earnings are out)
    *   A broader market article mentions Wall Street's Fed rate cut conviction.

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Revenue is consistently growing. The profit margin is strong and relatively stable.
    *   Equity has decreased, while ROE remains negative. This suggests that the company is not efficiently generating profits from its equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Snowflake presents a mixed picture.

*   **Positives:**  Strong revenue growth, high profit margins, and a "Buy" analyst consensus suggest potential. The MRI is high, supporting investment.
*   **Negatives:** SNOW has lagged the S&P 500. Historical performance shows high volatility and negative alpha. Negative EPS and ROE raise concerns about profitability. The sharp drop in price at the last market close and negative expected return (even long-term) are significant red flags.
*   **Overall:** SNOW is a high-growth company with significant risks. The data suggest caution. Investors should carefully weigh the growth potential against the volatility and lack of current profitability. The recent price drop and negative expected return warrant close scrutiny. The analyst target prices show a range of opinions.
