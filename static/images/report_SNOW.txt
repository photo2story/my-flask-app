**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $179.29
* **5-day Moving Average:** $179.97
* **20-day Moving Average:** $168.77
* **60-day Moving Average:** $159.00

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting some recent downward pressure. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term uptrend.  The recent price change shows a decrease of -$1.96 from the previous close.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 71.47 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.76 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -157.9% (Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is projected)

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to a correction.  The positive PPO confirms short-term bullish momentum, but it's important to consider the highly negative expected return. The recent price drop of -$1.96 reflects a slight downward movement but is not extreme.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals consistent net losses (negative EPS) over the past few quarters.  While revenue is growing, the company hasn't achieved profitability.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98 | $0.94 B       |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is growing consistently quarter over quarter.  Profit margins remain strong, but the negative ROE indicates the company is not generating sufficient returns on equity, which is a serious concern.

| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B   | 65.94%        |

| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B  | -3.27%  |
| 2023-10-31 | $4.93B  | -4.35%  |



**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth but persistent losses and negative ROE.  While short-term technical indicators suggest some bullish momentum, the long-term outlook is considerably bearish, given the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 and projected negative returns.  The high beta implies substantial risk.  Investors should proceed with caution and carefully assess their risk tolerance before investing in SNOW.  The negative expected return is a major red flag and warrants further investigation into the company's future profitability and growth strategy.
