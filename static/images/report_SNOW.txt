The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 in recent periods, with a negative expected return, and negative alpha except for the most recent 2023-2025 period.

The recent surge in price, coupled with the overbought RSI, suggests a potential short-term correction. The low-risk MRI and hybrid signal indicate a safe investment, but these signals need to be considered in light of the negative expected return, recent negative earnings results, and recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500. The recent news highlights potential positive developments but also increased volatility.

**Recommendation:** Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is advisable. Monitor upcoming earnings reports, analyst commentary, and news for further insights into the company's profitability and future prospects. Consider the potential for a short-term pullback due to overbought conditions.
