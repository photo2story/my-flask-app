**0) Summary Statistics:**

* **Ticker:** SNOW
* **Company:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.
* **Current Price:** $173.60

**1) Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Snowflake's cumulative return (-5.21%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 62.89%.  The current divergence is -68.1%, placing it at the 26.7th percentile of historical divergence based on the provided min/max range.  This indicates Snowflake's performance has been considerably weaker than the broader market over the measured period.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently negative alpha values across all periods, indicating Snowflake's returns have been below what would be expected given its beta (market risk exposure).  The high beta values suggest Snowflake is highly sensitive to overall market movements. Notably, the beta increased from 47.4 in 2020-2022 to 65.7 in 2021-2023, implying increased market sensitivity.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates significantly between periods, ranging from strongly negative to positive. This highlights the volatility inherent in SNOW's performance.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -44.0% | 21.1% | -49.0% | 47.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -7.0% | 21.1% | -30.0% | 65.7 |
| 2022-2024  | -19.0% | 21.1% | -51.0% | 51.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 23.0% | 11.8% | -0.4 | 57.3 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $172.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $181.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $173.66

The price is currently below both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The 5-day moving average is close to the current price, indicating recent price stability but still below the longer-term averages.  The slight daily price decrease (-0.0287%) is not significant.

* **PPO:** -0.9987 (Negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 8.3 (+) (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -114.3% (This highly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern and requires further investigation of the calculation methodology.)


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has reported negative EPS for all periods shown. Revenue is growing steadily, but the negative EPS raises concerns about profitability.  There appears to be a duplication of data for November 27th, 2024.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98 | $0.94B        |
| 2024-08-29 | -0.95 | $0.87B        |

| 2024-11-27 | -0.65 | $0.73B        |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is showing steady growth, while profit margins remain high, suggesting efficiency in operations. However, the negative ROE (Return on Equity) across all quarters is alarming and indicates the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity. The equity value fluctuates but shows a downward trend from Q1 2024.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31  | $0.94B  | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31  | $0.87B  | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30  | $0.83B  | 67.12%        |
| 2024-01-31  | $0.77B  | 68.79%        |
| 2023-10-31  | $0.73B  | 68.82%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE         |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31  | $2.93B  | -11.07%      |
| 2024-07-31  | $4.13B  | -7.67%       |

| 2023-10-31  | $4.93B  | -4.35%       |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's performance has been significantly underwhelming compared to the S&P 500, with consistent negative alpha and a high beta indicating market sensitivity. While revenue is growing, consistently negative EPS and ROE raise serious concerns about long-term profitability and sustainability. The negative expected return (-114.3%) needs clarification.  The technical indicators (RSI and PPO) suggest a bearish sentiment, while short-term momentum shows a slight upward trend.  Given the current financial picture and significant underperformance, a cautious approach is warranted before investing in Snowflake.  Further investigation into the -114.3% expected return calculation is crucial.  The duplicated data entry should be corrected.
