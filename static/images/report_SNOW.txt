| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |

| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95  | $0.87 B       |

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $0.99B  | 66.23%        |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B  | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B  | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B  | 67.12%        |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B  | 68.79%        |

Revenue shows consistent growth.  High profit margins are observed, but it's crucial to remember that these are based on revenue and do not reflect net profitability due to the negative EPS.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity  | ROE     |
|------------|---------|---------|
| 2025-01-31 | $3.00B  | -10.92% |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B  | -11.07% |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B  | -7.67%  |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B  | -6.95%  |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B  | -3.27%  |

Negative ROE across all quarters indicates that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity, despite showing revenue growth and high profit margins.  The fluctuation in equity needs further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins, but this is not translating into profitability (negative EPS and ROE).  The stock is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, with high volatility (high Beta). Technical indicators paint a mixed picture, with bearish momentum (RSI) and a weak positive signal (PPO).  The high-risk profile (MRI) and the negative expected return highlight significant investment risks.  Before considering long-term investment, further investigation into the reasons for negative EPS and ROE,  the fluctuation in equity, and the duplicated data point in the earnings report is necessary.  The current negative performance, coupled with high volatility, makes it a risky investment at this time.
