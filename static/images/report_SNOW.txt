2025-12-17 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of SNOW (Snowflake Inc.) based on the provided data, followed by a comprehensive analysis.

**Snowflake Inc. Overview:** Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing company that enables customers to store and analyze data in the cloud.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **SNOW Cumulative Return:** 26.12%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 52.94%
*   **Divergence:** -26.82% (Current position within divergence range: Relative Divergence: 36.1%)

**Analysis:** Snowflake has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.  The divergence indicates Snowflake is lagging behind the broader market. The relative divergence suggests that while there has been some improvement, the performance remains closer to the minimum divergence level than the maximum. This means there's a substantial gap to close to match the S&P 500's returns.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -25.0% | 75.3% | -9.0% | 0.0 | 49.1 |
| 2021-2023  | -25.0% | 78.3% | -27.0% | 0.1 | 68.1 |
| 2022-2024  | -26.0% | 78.3% | -46.0% | 0.1 | 52.8 |
| 2023-2025  | 47.0% | 79.8% | -17.0% | -0.0 | 75.5 |

*   **CAGR:** While 2023-2025 shows a strong CAGR of 47%, the previous periods had negative CAGR's, indicating significant losses.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high (around 75-80%), indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The negative Alpha values consistently show that Snowflake has underperformed relative to its benchmark. This signifies the stock hasn't generated excess returns compared to what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are close to 0 or slightly positive. A beta close to 0 suggests the stock's price is relatively uncorrelated with the market. Beta of 0.1 implies Snowflake stock price moves only 10% of benchmark.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization fluctuates which can reflect changes in investor sentiment and/or company performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 220.59
*   **Last-market Price:** 220.60, Previous Close: 215.28, Change: 2.47
*   **5-day SMA:** 218.18
*   **20-day SMA:** 237.87
*   **60-day SMA:** 245.71

**Analysis:** The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a recent downtrend. The 5-day SMA being below the current price might signal a short-term upward movement, but needs to be monitored. The increase in price compared to previous close might indicate a sharp rebound.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 31.68 (Oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.22
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.1 (+) 단기상승 (short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -39.8%

**Analysis:**
*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI indicates the stock may be oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity.
*   The negative PPO reinforces the downtrend suggested by the SMAs.
*   The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy.
*   Despite short-term rise, a negative expected return of -39.8% is very concerning and indicates significant potential losses if held long-term. This is compounded by the excess return compared to S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed Headlines:** The news articles paint a mixed picture. Some express bullish sentiment ahead of earnings, while others highlight the stock's decline after earnings.  There's also an article suggesting SNOW could outperform Palantir in the AI space.
*   **Earnings Miss Impact:** Several articles focus on the stock's negative reaction to earnings, indicating the market was not pleased with the results or guidance.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.59 (Buy)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 281.14, High: 500.00, Low: 170.00

**Analysis:**  Analysts are generally optimistic about Snowflake, with a "Buy" consensus and a target price significantly above the current price.  However, the wide range in target prices (170.00 - 500.00) suggests considerable uncertainty about the company's future performance. The lack of recent rating changes suggests that analysts have not updated their views in light of recent performance.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**Analysis:**

*   **EPS:** Snowflake consistently reports negative Earnings Per Share (EPS), indicating the company is not yet profitable.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE       |
|--------------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-10-31   | $2.13B   | -13.78%   |
| 2025-07-31   | $2.37B   | -12.56%   |

| 2024-10-31   | $2.93B   | -11.07%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Strong and consistent revenue growth is evident.
*   **Profit Margin:** The profit margin is very high, indicating Snowflake's ability to generate a significant profit from each dollar of revenue.  However, this doesn't translate into overall profitability due to high operating expenses.
*   **Equity:** Equity has fluctuated, declining over the most recent periods.
*   **ROE:** The negative Return on Equity (ROE) confirms the lack of profitability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Snowflake presents a mixed picture.

*   **Positives:** Strong revenue growth, high profit margins, and a "Buy" consensus from analysts are encouraging.  The recent price rebound and oversold RSI might indicate a short-term buying opportunity.
*   **Negatives:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, high volatility (MDD), negative Alpha, consistent net losses (negative EPS & ROE), and a concerning negative expected return are major red flags. The news headlines suggest market disappointment following recent earnings reports.

**Overall Assessment:**

Investing in Snowflake appears highly speculative. While the company shows strong growth potential and analyst optimism, the current financial metrics and market sentiment suggest a high degree of risk. The company needs to demonstrate a path to profitability to justify its valuation and overcome the current negative market perception.
