2024-12-04 - Analysis Report
## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

This report analyzes Snowflake Inc. (SNOW), a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company, based on the provided data.  Note that some data points are missing or incomplete, limiting the depth of the analysis.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Snowflake's cumulative return (-7.27%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's return (79.14%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -86.4%, placing it at the 17.4th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided relative divergence metric).  This indicates a substantial underperformance compared to the broader market. The provided CAGR data further supports this, showing negative returns over various periods.  The high beta values (47.0-66.0) suggest high sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $175.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $173.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $144.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $124.87

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively large gap between the short-term (5-day) and longer-term (20-day, 60-day) moving averages indicates a recent price surge.  The last-market price of $175.99, being only slightly higher than the closing price, does not suggest an extreme price jump or drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 83.60 – This high RSI value suggests the stock is in overbought territory, potentially indicating a near-term correction.
* **PPO:** 2.12 – A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:**  `nan` – The missing data prevents an analysis of recent relative strength.  More information is needed.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – The provided expected return of 0% suggests no significant alpha generation over the S&P 500 in the long term (2+ years). This should be interpreted with caution due to the significant underperformance noted earlier.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals a consistent net loss (negative EPS) over the past five quarters.  Revenue is growing steadily, albeit at a moderate pace.  There's no information on earnings expectations to assess whether the reported numbers "beat" or "missed" expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue shows consistent growth, while profit margins remain relatively stable and high.  However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, suggesting the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity investment. The decrease in equity over the periods is also concerning.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent earnings news (within the last 2 days) or market outlook/analyst opinions are provided, limiting this aspect of the analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake (SNOW) demonstrates strong revenue growth but persistent net losses and negative ROE.  The stock significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the provided period, displaying high beta and a high RSI indicating overbought conditions. The provided expected return is 0%, although this might not accurately reflect the actual potential, given the context of the historical data. Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative EPS and ROE, alongside analysis of the missing data points (20-day relative divergence and earnings expectations), is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.  The recent price surge warrants caution given the overbought RSI and historical underperformance.
