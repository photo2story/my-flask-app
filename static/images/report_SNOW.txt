## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Analysis

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  The provided data shows mixed performance for SNOW, lagging significantly behind the S&P 500 (VOO) but exhibiting some recent positive signs.  Further analysis is needed to determine future potential.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **SNOW Cumulative Return:** -14.15%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 15.01%
* **Return Difference:** -29.16%  (SNOW underperformed VOO by 29.16%)
* **Relative Divergence:** -36.2% (SNOW's performance is at the 36.2nd percentile relative to its historical performance range against VOO).  This suggests SNOW is performing relatively poorly compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently negative alpha values across various periods, indicating underperformance compared to the market benchmark.  The high beta values (48.0 - 50.5) indicate that SNOW's price is highly sensitive to market movements, amplifying both gains and losses.  The negative CAGR further confirms underperformance. Note that MDD (Maximum Drawdown) shows significant declines in the past, highlighting the inherent risk involved with investing in SNOW.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -46.0%   | 70.5% | -0.1  | 48.0  |       |
| 2021-2023  | -33.0%   | 70.5% | -0.0  | 66.5  |       |
| 2022-2024  | -13.0%   | 73.9% | -0.0  | 51.6  |       |
| 2023-2025  | 27.0%    | 97.4% | -0.1  | 50.5  |       |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $151.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $137.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $150.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $167.40

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it's significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term downtrend.  The recent price increase of $13.21 from the previous close suggests a recent, potentially sharp, upward movement.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.96 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.5356 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -64.6% (Significant negative expected return relative to S&P 500 over the long term).  This large negative expected return warrants further investigation into the reasons behind this projection. The recent sharp price increase (`change`: 13.21) may be a temporary factor not fully captured in the long-term projection.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent net losses (negative EPS) and increasing revenue, suggesting the company is experiencing revenue growth but not yet achieving profitability.  The slight increase in revenue suggests growth, but the losses are significant.  It's critical to understand the reasons behind these losses to predict future profitability.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98  | $0.94B      |
| 2024-08-29 | -0.95  | $0.87B      |
| 2024-05-31 | -0.95  | $0.83B      |
| 2023-12-01 | -0.65  | $0.73B      |
| 2024-11-27 | -0.65  | $0.73B      |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is steadily increasing, indicating growth. Profit margins are consistently high (65-68%), which is positive. However, the negative Return on Equity (ROE) is a significant concern, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity investments. This needs careful consideration, especially with the consistent net losses.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $0.99B  | 66.23%        |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B  | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B  | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B  | 67.12%        |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B  | 68.79%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity  | ROE        |
|------------|---------|------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $3.00B  | -10.92%     |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B  | -11.07%     |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B  | -7.67%      |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B  | -6.95%      |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B  | -3.27%      |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth but struggles with consistent profitability, reflected in negative EPS and ROE.  The high beta suggests significant market risk. While recent price action shows a short-term upward trend, the long-term outlook, as indicated by the negative expected return (-64.6%) relative to the S&P 500, is concerning.  The significant underperformance against VOO, coupled with the high risk profile, makes SNOW a high-risk investment.  Investors should carefully consider the reasons for consistent net losses and the sustainability of high revenue growth before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the company's growth strategy and path to profitability is crucial.  The -64.6% expected return is a very negative indicator and requires a thorough understanding of the underlying assumptions.
