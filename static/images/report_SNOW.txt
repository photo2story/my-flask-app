**7. Overall Analysis:**

SNOW is currently showing significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, despite showing consistent revenue growth.  Negative EPS and ROE are major concerns.  While the high profit margins are noteworthy, they need to be analyzed in context with the overall financial picture, including potential accounting practices which could explain these high margins.  The high Beta indicates substantial volatility and risk. The -159.6% expected return is likely inaccurate and requires clarification, but the overall picture paints a cautionary outlook for SNOW.  A long-term investment strategy would need to carefully consider the inherent risks and potential for significant losses.  Further investigation into the -159.6% expected return figure is crucial before making any investment decisions.
