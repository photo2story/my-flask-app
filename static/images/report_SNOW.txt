The technical indicators suggest short-term positive momentum, but long-term expected returns are concerning.

**Investment Recommendation:**

However, the negative profitability and underperformance relative to the market should be carefully considered. A cautious approach with a smaller allocation might be warranted, focusing on monitoring future earnings and market performance.
