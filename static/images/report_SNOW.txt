Equity is also decreasing, which could be a concern.

### 7. Overall Analysis & Summary

Snowflake (SNOW) presents a mixed picture. While revenue is growing and profit margins are strong, the company is not currently profitable (negative EPS) and is significantly underperforming the S&P 500. The negative expected return further reinforces this concern. The high MDD and variable CAGR highlight the volatility of the stock. Recent news suggests volatility and significant events, requiring close monitoring. The recent decline in equity and increasingly negative ROE raise additional concerns.

**Recommendation:** Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is advised. The negative expected return and negative earnings suggest significant risk. While the company has strong revenue growth and high profit margins, profitability and relative performance are lagging. Investors should closely monitor upcoming earnings reports and news events before making investment decisions. The current hybrid signal (69% cash) reflects the uncertainty surrounding the stock.
