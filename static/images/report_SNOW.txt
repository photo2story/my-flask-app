| 2023-2025  | 48.0%  | 79.8% | -19.0% | -0.0 | 76.0   |

**Analysis:**
*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows inconsistent performance, with periods of significant decline followed by a strong recovery.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD indicates substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Negative Alpha values suggest SNOW has consistently underperformed relative to its risk (Beta).
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to 0 indicate that SNOW's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization varies significantly.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Previous Close:** 222.9

*   **20-day SMA:** 226.5047
*   **60-day SMA:** 245.0857

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA). The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are significantly below the 60-day SMA, indicating a short-term downward trend. The negative change from the previous close reinforces this.

*   **Expected Return:** -43.0% (Negative long-term outlook)

**Analysis:**

*   While the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, this contrasts with the other indicators.
*   The RSI is neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   PPO is near zero which suggests very little momentum.
*   The hybrid signal is giving a safe buy signal.
*   The negative expected return is a major concern, indicating significant potential losses if investing from this point for the long term.
*   Recent relative divergence change indicates a short-term decline, aligning with the SMA analysis.
*   The small price change ({-0.38}) indicates no recent significant fluctuation.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity | ROE       |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| 2025-10-31   | $2.13B | -13.78%   |
| 2025-07-31   | $2.37B | -12.56%   |

| 2024-10-31   | $2.93B | -11.07%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is steadily increasing, and the profit margin is very high (approaching 70%). This indicates strong pricing power and efficient operations *if* those margins lead to profitability.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is decreasing over the most recent quarters, and ROE (Return on Equity) is significantly negative, reflecting the company's losses relative to its equity base.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Snowflake presents a mixed picture:

*   **Negative:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative expected return, consistent unprofitability (negative EPS and negative ROE), recent short-term price decline, sale of shares by a company executive.
*   **Positive:** High revenue growth, high-profit margins (though not translating to net profit), "Buy" analyst consensus, news suggesting potential for future growth, potential acquisition targets.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the data, while analysts are optimistic, the current state of Snowflake suggests caution. The high valuation relative to its lack of profitability, the underperformance versus the S&P 500, and the negative expected return are significant red flags. The high MRI score should be viewed skeptically in light of these other factors.
While the revenue growth and high profit margins offer promise, investors should closely monitor the company's progress towards profitability and its ability to outperform the market before considering a significant investment.
