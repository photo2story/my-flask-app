Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided Snowflake (SNOW) data:

**0. Summary Request Fulfilled**

The report below contains simple numbers first, followed by simple analysis of those numbers.

**1. Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing company.
*   **SNOW Cumulative Return:** 26.99%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 55.34%
*   **Divergence:** -28.34%
*   **Relative Divergence:** 34.6%

**Analysis:** Snowflake has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period for which cumulative return is measured. The divergence is currently -28.3%.  The relative divergence of 34.6% suggests that the current divergence is closer to its minimum than its maximum over the observed timeframe.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2024-2026  | 27.0% | 79.8% | -29.0% | 0.0 | 75.5 |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 27.0% - Indicates the average annual growth rate over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 79.8% - Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period, indicating high risk.
*   **Alpha:** -29.0% - A negative alpha suggests that the investment has underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** 0.0 - A beta of 0 indicates that the security's price is not correlated with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** 75.5B - Company's market capitalization in billions.

**Analysis:** The high MDD and negative alpha suggest that while SNOW shows potential for high growth (CAGR), it comes with significant risk and has underperformed its benchmark. A zero beta would be unexpected and should be verified as beta is usually around 1.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 222.05
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 220.52, Previous Close: 222.05, Change: -0.69
*   **5-day SMA:** 223.17
*   **20-day SMA:** 226.50
*   **60-day SMA:** 245.09

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This *could* indicate a short-term downward trend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, further supporting this potential downward trend. The last market data shows a slight decrease.

**3. Indicators Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 49.38
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.3777
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (4 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-03)
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -3.4 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -43.2% (Long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment risk level. The RSI is near 50, indicating a neutral momentum (neither overbought nor oversold). The negative divergence change supports the short-term downward trend indicated by the moving averages. The Hybrid Signal suggests a moderately bullish position. *However,* the significant negative Expected Return (-43.2%) is a major red flag, suggesting potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon. The negative change in relative divergence indicates a recent short-term decline.
