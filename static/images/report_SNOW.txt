|------------|---------|-------|----------|--------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | 47.0% | 79.8% | -17.0%  | -0.0 | 75.5   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Underperformance:** SNOW has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, as evidenced by the negative divergence.
    *   **Alpha:** The consistently negative alpha indicates that SNOW has underperformed relative to its expected return based on its beta (market risk). The alpha has become increasingly negative over the reported periods, signaling worsening performance.
    *   **Beta:** The beta values are near 0 in some periods, and around 0.1 in others, suggesting SNOW's price movement is not strongly correlated with the broader market, though this has shifted slightly to the positive in the last couple years.
    *   **Volatility:** The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures indicate substantial price volatility and risk.
    *   **CAGR:** The negative Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the first three periods reflect poor returns over those timeframes, while the most recent period shows a strong recovery in terms of growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close: 220.60
*   Last Market Data: Price = 220.6, Previous Close = 215.28, Change = 2.47
*   5-day SMA: 218.17
*   20-day SMA: 238.33
*   60-day SMA: 245.83

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Short-Term Uptrend:** The price is above its previous close, and the 5-day SMA is above the immediate price, hinting at a recent short-term rebound.
    *   **Downtrend Relative to Medium and Long Term:** The price is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating a downtrend in the medium and long term despite the recent uptick.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Market Risk Indicators**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 32.09
*   PPO: -1.27
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (4 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = 0.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   Expected Return (%): -39.8%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI of 32.09 indicates that the stock is approaching oversold conditions, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity (but shouldn't be taken as a sole indicator).
    *   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests the stock is in a downtrend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** This suggests a buy signal based on a composite of indicators, but with a 0% cash position recommendation, implying full investment.
    *   **Relative Divergence Change:** The positive change in relative divergence over the past 20 days aligns with the short-term price rebound, implying a potential recovery.
    *   **Expected Return:** The very negative expected return (-39.8%) suggests analysts anticipate poor returns over the next two years, based on the data.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes:**
    *   **Earnings Miss/Tumble:** Several articles highlight how SNOW stock fell despite beating earnings estimates. This suggests market disappointment with other aspects of the report (guidance, growth rate, etc.).

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Strong Revenue Growth and High Profit Margins:** Revenue has been consistently increasing, and the profit margins are very high, suggesting a strong business model *if* they can translate these margins into net profit.
    *   **Negative ROE and Declining Equity:** The negative ROE (Return on Equity) confirms the unprofitability. The equity has generally declined, indicating that the company is using up its assets, primarily to fund losses.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Mixed Outlook:** SNOW presents a complex picture. It has strong revenue growth, very high profit margins (at the gross level), and is considered an AI play, which is currently in favor. Analysts have a generally positive view, with a "Buy" rating and high price targets. However, SNOW has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, is not yet profitable, and the market has reacted negatively to recent earnings despite beats, likely due to concerns about profitability or future growth.

*   **Key Risks:**
    *   **Unprofitability:** The biggest concern is the lack of profitability. The company is burning through cash, which is reflected in the negative ROE and decline in equity.
    *   **Valuation:** Even with recent price drops, SNOW's valuation remains high. It may be pricing in future growth that is not guaranteed.
    *   **Market Sentiment:** The market has recently reacted negatively to earnings, suggesting a potential shift in sentiment.

*   **Key Opportunities:**
    *   **Revenue Growth:** SNOW's strong revenue growth and high gross profit margins indicate a potentially successful business model.
    *   **AI Potential:** If SNOW can successfully capitalize on the AI trend, it could drive future growth.
    *   **Analyst Support:** The continued analyst support suggests that the company has potential to recover.

*   **Overall Recommendation:** Cautious optimism is warranted. While there are significant risks, the company's revenue growth and analyst support suggest that it could potentially turn things around. Investors should closely monitor the company's progress towards profitability. The negative expected return also warrants caution.
