Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  The cumulative return of SNOW is -5.03%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 76.06%.  This represents a significant underperformance of SNOW compared to the market benchmark.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures show significant volatility in SNOW's performance over the analyzed periods. While 2023-2025 shows positive growth, overall performance against the market (as indicated by the negative alpha) and high beta (significantly above 1) reveal high market sensitivity and considerable risk.  The high beta suggests that SNOW's price tends to move more dramatically than the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $174.12
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $174.17
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $164.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $154.73

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent minor downward trend. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend in the medium to long term.  The recent close shows a slight decrease (-$0.47) from the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 76.04 – This suggests the stock is currently in overbought territory, indicating potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.67 – A positive value suggests upward momentum, but the RSI suggests caution.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.6 – Indicates a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -187.0% – This represents a significant projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This extremely negative forecast needs careful consideration and likely warrants further investigation into the underlying assumptions.  The large negative change in price from the previous close (-$0.47) is noteworthy, although not extreme enough to constitute a major event like a sudden crash.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) over the reported quarters, indicating that Snowflake is not currently profitable. However, revenue is steadily increasing, suggesting growth potential despite the losses. The consistent negative EPS is concerning and needs to be considered seriously.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98  | $0.94 B     |
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95  | $0.87 B     |
| 2024-05-31 | -$0.95  | $0.83 B     |
| 2023-12-01 | -$0.65  | $0.73 B     |
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65  | $0.73 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is steadily increasing, but the high profit margins are offset by negative ROE (Return on Equity), indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its shareholder investments despite high revenue and margin. The decreasing equity values quarter over quarter present further concern.  The negative ROE across all quarters is a very significant negative factor.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B     | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B     | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B     | 67.12%        |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B     | 68.79%        |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.73B     | 68.82%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE          |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B     | -11.07%      |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B     | -7.67%       |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B     | -6.95%       |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B     | -3.27%       |
| 2023-10-31 | $4.93B     | -4.35%       |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake (SNOW) exhibits strong revenue growth but is currently unprofitable and significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest overbought conditions and a potential short-term correction.  The negative ROE is particularly alarming and signals a major concern for long-term investors. The projected negative long-term return (-187%) is a stark warning sign and needs substantial further investigation to understand the underlying reasons for this prediction.  A high beta suggests significant market risk.  While revenue growth is positive, the lack of profitability and the negative ROE strongly outweigh this positive factor.  Further due diligence is crucial before considering any investment in SNOW.
