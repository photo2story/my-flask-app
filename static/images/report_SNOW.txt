*   **Technical Indicators:** Technical indicators present a mixed picture. A very low RSI suggests that the stock is oversold and could be ready for a potential rebound.
*   **Risks:** High volatility (high MDD) and recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500 are significant risks.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on this data, the recommendation is **hold or a small buy, but with caution.** While the long-term growth potential appears significant, the current unprofitability, high volatility, and negative expected return suggest that careful consideration is needed.
