| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
| :----------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| 2025-07-31 | $2.37B   | -12.56%   |

**Analysis:**

* Equity has fluctuated during the period, initially decreasing and then stabilizing.
* The Return on Equity (ROE) is negative in all reported quarters, indicating that Snowflake is not generating profits from shareholders' equity. This is expected for a growth company still focusing on expanding.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Snowflake is a high-growth, but volatile stock. It has underperformed the S&P 500 recently. While revenue is growing consistently and profit margins are strong, the company is currently unprofitable, reflected in negative EPS and ROE. The stock appears oversold based on RSI. Analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy", but target prices vary significantly, suggesting uncertainty. Recent news is mixed, with some positive reports offset by institutional selling. The short-term trend is downward. While the Market Risk Indicator is at a medium level, the current price drop, combined with negative returns, make this a risky, although potentially high-reward investment. Overall, Snowflake seems to be a company with strong potential but requires a higher risk tolerance.
