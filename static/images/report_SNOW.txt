Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) based on the provided data, structured as requested:

**0) Report Introduction**

This report provides an analysis of Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) stock, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), examining its financial indicators, recent news, analyst opinions, and earnings data, and summarizing with a final overview.

**1) Return Rate Comparison: SNOW vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** SNOW
*   **Company Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing company providing data storage and analytics services.
*   **SNOW Cumulative Return:** 28.04%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 56.35%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: -26.8
    *   Max: 36.8
    *   Min: -62.8
    *   Relative Divergence: 36.1

**Analysis:** SNOW has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a cumulative return far below that of the index. The divergence is currently at -26.8, but the relative divergence of 36.1 suggests that it is towards the lower end of its historical fluctuation range compared to VOO. This indicates the degree of underperformance relative to the index, and also shows that SNOW may have potentially high volatility.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -25.0%  | 75.3%   | -9.0%    | 0.0    | 49.1   |
| 2021-2023  | -25.0%  | 78.3%   | -27.0%   | 0.1    | 68.1   |
| 2022-2024  | -26.0%  | 78.3%   | -46.0%   | 0.1    | 52.8   |
| 2023-2025  | 49.0%   | 79.8%   | -19.0%   | -0.0   | 76.6   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** CAGR for the periods observed is inconsistent, ranging from negative returns to a positive return for 2023-2025.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) across all periods suggests high volatility and significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** Negative Alpha values suggest underperformance relative to the benchmark (market). SNOW is not generating excess returns compared to what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are near 0. This suggests that SNOW's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market, i.e., the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization varies throughout the periods shown.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 223.88
*   **Last Market Data:**

    *   Previous Close: 221.93
    *   Change: 0.88
*   **5-day SMA:** 224.04
*   **20-day SMA:** 229.86
*   **60-day SMA:** 245.60

**Analysis:** The stock price closed slightly up from the previous day. However, the stock is trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day simple moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend in the short to medium term. The biggest decline of SNOW is observed at 60-day SMA.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 44.94
*   **PPO:** 0.29
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (4 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.4 (+): Short-term rise
*   **Expected Return (%):** -40.0

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A MRI of 1.0 suggests a highly favorable market environment for investment based on that specific indicator's scale, which seems questionable given SNOW's specific performance.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 44.94 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) suggests short-term price momentum is slightly bullish, but still near zero.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal advises allocating almost all cash (90%) into SNOW, suggesting a bullish outlook despite other factors. However, the recommendation includes a "Safe" label, despite the high allocation and the negative expected return.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Indicates that SNOW has performed slightly better than VOO in the last 20 days.
*   **Expected Return:** A -40% expected return is highly bearish, suggesting a significant potential for losses if held long-term.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출        |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2025-12-05 | -0.87  | 1.21 B$     |
| 2025-09-05 | -0.89  | 1.14 B$     |
| 2025-05-30 | -1.29  | 1.04 B$     |
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98  | 0.94 B$     |
| 2025-12-05 | -0.98  | 0.94 B$     |

**Analysis:** While revenue has been growing consistently, the company continues to report negative Earnings Per Share (EPS). This suggests that the company is spending more than it is earning, despite revenue growth. The last two rows have the same dates, so one of them is probably a duplicate and/or contains corrupted data.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Snowflake (SNOW) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Underperformance:** It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **High Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility, as shown by the MDD.
*   **Bearish Expected Returns:** Negative expected returns indicate potential future losses.

*   **Growing Revenue, No Profit:** Revenue is growing, profit margins are high, but the company is still not profitable, and ROE is negative.

**Conclusion:** While Snowflake has growth potential in the AI and cloud data space, its lack of profitability and underperformance relative to the market raise concerns. The market risk indicator is contradictory to most other signals. Investors should weigh the potential for future growth against the current financial realities and high volatility before investing. The analyst optimism and acquisition talks are potential catalysts but require careful monitoring.
