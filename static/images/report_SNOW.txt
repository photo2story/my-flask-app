**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing company.
*   **Return Comparison:** SNOW's cumulative return (27.23%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (54.02%).
*   **Divergence:** The current divergence is -26.8, with a relative divergence of 36.1. This means that SNOW's performance relative to the S&P 500 is currently in the lower third of its historical range.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -25.0% | 75.3% | -9.0% | 0.0 | 49.1 |
| 2021-2023  | -25.0% | 78.3% | -27.0% | 0.1 | 68.1 |
| 2022-2024  | -26.0% | 78.3% | -46.0% | 0.1 | 52.8 |
| 2023-2025  | 48.0% | 79.8% | -17.0% | -0.0 | 76.1 |

*   **Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:**
    *   **CAGR:** Shows significant negative compound annual growth rate except for the most recent period (2023-2025), which is positive.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently negative, indicating SNOW has underperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis for each period except the most recent.  A negative alpha means the stock is generating lower returns than predicted by the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
    *   **Beta:** Beta is close to zero in prior periods, meaning the stock price is not sensitive to changes in market returns (S&P500). The beta close to zero is statistically difficult to achieve, and may indicate an error.
    *   **Cap (B):** Market Capitalization has fluctuated.
    *   **In sum, Snowflake has recently improved with significant annual growth in 2023-2025; however, it also has experienced a high maximum drawdown, and consistently had low Alpha and Beta indexes.**

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 222.46

*   **20-day SMA:** 233.7222
*   **60-day SMA:** 245.6957

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which suggests a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is also below the 20-day SMA, reinforcing this signal. The recent small price increase may represent a bottoming out or consolidation.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 25.98 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.5031
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (4 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-03)

*   **Expected Return (%):** -40.0 (Negative outlook for the next 2 years compared to S&P 500).

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** Suggests a moderate risk level.
    *   **RSI:** The low RSI indicates that the stock is oversold and could be due for a rebound.
    *   **PPO:** The negative PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) indicates a bearish trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The current buy signal is categorized as 'Safe', and the MRI is at 0.8, so the MRI is more positive than the general indicator, which could be due to an AI-based analysis of complex variables.
    *   **Divergence:** The recent short-term upward divergence provides a slightly positive signal.
    *   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return is a major cause for concern, suggesting analysts are not optimistic about SNOW's performance relative to the S&P 500 over the next two years.

*   **Unprofitability:** The company is still unprofitable, as shown by negative EPS and ROE.
*   **Volatility:** High Maximum Drawdown indicates considerable risk.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The negative expected return suggests limited upside potential compared to the broader market over the next two years.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** The Hybrid signal, the analyst ratings, and the "Buy the Dip" articles offer more bullish views, but they are offset by the fundamental financial data.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on this data, a cautious approach is warranted. While Snowflake exhibits growth potential, the lack of profitability and underperformance relative to the market are significant risks.
