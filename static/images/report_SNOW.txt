## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.

As of the last data point, SNOW's cumulative return is -10.86%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 66.64%.  This represents a significant divergence of **-77.5%**.  The relative divergence of -77.5% places SNOW at the 20.4th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (-108.0% to 41.2%).  This indicates SNOW has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha values are consistently near zero, suggesting that SNOW's performance is largely explained by market movements (beta). However, the high and fluctuating beta values (47.0 to 66.0) indicate significant sensitivity to overall market changes.  The negative CAGR values across most periods further highlight underperformance.  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, indicating substantial periods of significant losses.

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -44.0% | 21.1% | -0.0  | 47.0  |
| 2021-2023  | -7.0%  | 21.1% | -0.0  | 66.0  |
| 2022-2024  | -19.0% | 21.1% | -0.0  | 51.0  |
| 2023-2025  | 18.0%  | 11.8% | -0.0  | 54.0  |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $163.41
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $161.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $162.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $148.30

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it is still below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.70 (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** -0.41 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum.)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +3.4% (Short-term upward momentum.)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, >2 years):** -157.8% (This exceptionally negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major red flag and needs further investigation to determine its basis.)  The current price of $163.41 doesn't appear to reflect any major recent event (sudden surge or crash) based on available data.

The extremely negative expected return warrants significant caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent losses (negative EPS) and revenue growth, although the growth rate seems to be slowing.  There's a duplicate entry for 2024-11-27.  Clarification is needed on the accuracy of the data.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98 | $0.94B      |
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95 | $0.87B      |
| 2024-05-31 | -$0.95 | $0.83B      |
| 2023-12-01 | -$0.65 | $0.73B      |
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65 | $0.73B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is steadily increasing, but profitability is high despite negative EPS. This discrepancy needs further investigation (potentially looking at non-GAAP earnings or other accounting practices).

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B     | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B     | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B     | 67.12%        |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B     | 68.79%        |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.73B     | 68.82%        |


**Capital and Profitability:** Equity is fluctuating, and ROE is negative, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity. This is a significant concern.

| Quarter    | Equity (B) | ROE (%)      |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93      | -11.07%      |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13      | -7.67%       |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56      | -6.95%       |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18      | -3.27%       |
| 2023-10-31 | $4.93      | -4.35%       |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's performance is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500.  While revenue is growing, the company is consistently reporting negative EPS and a negative ROE.  The extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is a major warning sign. The high beta indicates significant market risk.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the negative EPS despite high profit margins and the basis for the extremely pessimistic long-term return forecast.  Currently, the data suggests significant caution is warranted before considering an investment in SNOW.  The discrepancies in the provided data (duplicate earnings entry, negative EPS with high profit margins) require clarification and further investigation.
