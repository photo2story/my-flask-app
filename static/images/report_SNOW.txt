## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  As of the last data point provided, SNOW has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for SNOW is -12.19%, while the S&P 500's is 71.60%. This represents a divergence of -83.8%, placing it at the 16.2nd percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max values).  The provided CAGR data shows consistently negative performance over the past few years, highlighting significant underperformance compared to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $161.44
* **Last Market Price:** $163.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $165.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $172.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $138.86

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The gap between the current price and the 20-day and 60-day averages is substantial, indicating a considerable pullback from recent highs.  The last market price being higher than the closing price may indicate some positive sentiment from a very recent trading session.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 36.73 (Below 40 suggests oversold conditions, potentially indicating a bounce but not necessarily a bullish trend reversal)
* **PPO:** -2.25 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.2 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates no expected outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term; this is a projection and not a guarantee).  The lack of positive expected return, considering the significantly negative performance vs. S&P 500, adds concern for potential long term growth prospects.

Given that the Last Market ($163.06) is slightly higher than the closing price, there's a hint of a minor recovery, but it is not significant enough to suggest a rapid rebound (no evidence of "rapid uptrend" or "rapid downtrend").

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The reported EPS has been consistently negative over the past few quarters, with little change. While revenue has shown a slow but steady increase, the negative EPS and continued losses raise concerns.  There is no information provided about expectations to compare the results against.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue is consistently increasing quarter-over-quarter, showing positive growth.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are high but have shown a slight downward trend in the latest quarters.
* **Equity:**  Equity decreased significantly from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024 which could indicate financial stress.
* **ROE:** Return on Equity is negative across all reported quarters, which is a major concern for long term investors. This negative ROE reflects the consistent losses reported in the earnings.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **(Missing):**  No news or recent issues are provided.  Information on recent earnings announcements, market outlook, and analyst opinions is crucial for a complete assessment.  This section is critically missing data.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake is currently experiencing a period of significant underperformance compared to the broader market (S&P 500). While revenue growth is positive, negative EPS, decreasing equity, negative ROE, and consistently low technical indicators paint a concerning picture. The lack of provided recent news and analyst opinions further limits a comprehensive assessment.  The negative divergence from the S&P 500 and the negative expected return, without specific catalysts for a turnaround, raise significant risks for investors.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative EPS, the decrease in equity, and the specific market context (news, analyst opinions) is crucial before any investment decision.
