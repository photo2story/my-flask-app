**0) Report Summary:**

*   **SNOW has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly.** The cumulative return is lower, and the recent price action is negative.
*   **Technical indicators suggest SNOW is currently oversold but with mixed signals.** The price is below moving averages, RSI is low, but Market Risk Indicator indicates medium level.
*   **Recent news focuses on a stock price plunge following earnings.** Analyst opinions are mixed, but the consensus is still leaning toward "Buy".

**1) SNOW vs. S&P 500 (VOO) Performance:**

*   **Company Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing company.
*   **SNOW Cumulative Return:** 30.85%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 54.95%
*   **Divergence:** -24.1%
*   **Relative Divergence:** 38.9%

**Analysis:** SNOW has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The negative divergence of -24.1% indicates SNOW has lagged the market considerably. The relative divergence of 38.9% suggests that this underperformance is currently closer to its minimum divergence value than the maximum in the time period.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -25.0% | 75.3% | -9.0%  | 0.0  | 48.6   |
| 2021-2023  | -25.0% | 78.3% | -27.0% | 0.1  | 67.4   |
| 2022-2024  | -26.0% | 78.3% | -46.0% | 0.1  | 52.3   |
| 2023-2025  | 52.0% | 79.8% | -14.0% | -0.0 | 77.5   |

**Analysis:**  The table reveals several key points:

*   **CAGR:**  While the 2023-2025 period shows positive CAGR, the preceding periods show substantial negative returns.  This highlights significant volatility.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The consistently high MDD figures (around 75-80%) indicate very large potential losses for investors during these periods.
*   **Alpha:**  The consistently negative Alpha figures indicate that SNOW has underperformed relative to its risk (as measured by Beta). This suggests that the stock is not generating excess returns.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are near zero.  This *should* indicate very low systematic risk (low correlation with the market), but given the underperformance against VOO, it's questionable. This may indicate that the stock is behaving independently from the S\&P500, or that the sample range is too small to be reliable.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market Cap fluctuates, but has generally grown over the periods.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 228.79
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 228.79, 'previousClose': 234.77, 'change': -2.55} (Indicates a recent drop)
*   **5-day SMA:** 249.865
*   **20-day SMA:** 253.3467
*   **60-day SMA:** 246.2257

**Analysis:** The stock is currently trading below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This indicates a short-term and potentially intermediate-term downtrend. The recent market data confirms this downtrend.

**3) Indicators Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 35.77 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.89 (Negative Momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  cash\_0% Buy 90% of cash (4 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-03)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -13.5 (Negative, indicating a recent decline in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return:** -35.0% (Expected underperformance compared to S&P 500 over 2+ years)

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI being below 40 suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory, which *could* indicate a potential bounce.
*   The negative PPO confirms negative momentum.
*   The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests a medium investment risk. However, this conflicts with the *Expected Return* of -35%.
*   The recent divergence change confirms short-term underperformance.
*   The expected return is highly concerning, suggesting significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 even over the long term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Key Headlines:**
    *   "Why Snowflake Stock Plunged This Week"
    *   "Snowflake Stock Falls 10%"
    *   "Snowflake Vs. Palantir: Only One Deserves A More Than 200x P/E"

    *   "Snowflake Stock: The Dip That Smart Investors Are Buying Right Now"
    *   "Why Snowflake (SNOW) Shares Are Trading Lower Today"

**Analysis:** The news headlines overwhelmingly point to negative sentiment surrounding Snowflake following recent earnings.  The focus is on a stock price plunge, indicating investors are reacting negatively to the latest results.  Some articles suggest buying the dip, but this is countered by concerns about valuation (Palantir comparison) and questions about whether to buy, sell, or hold.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** "Buy" (Mean: 1.61)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 281.73 / High: 500.00 / Low: 170.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes listed.

**Analysis:** While the analyst consensus is still "Buy," the wide range in target prices (170 to 500) highlights the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future potential.  Without data on recent rating *changes*, it's impossible to gauge if analysts are revising their opinions in light of recent performance.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue    |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-12-05 | -0.87 | 1.21 B$    |

| 2025-12-05 | -0.98 | 0.94 B$    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue Growth:** Revenue has consistently increased over the past several quarters, indicating strong top-line growth.
*   **Persistent Losses:**  EPS remains negative, demonstrating that Snowflake is still not profitable.  The recent EPS of -0.87 is an improvement from previous quarters, but profitability is still elusive.

|--------------|---------|-----------|
| 2025-07-31   | $2.37B  | -12.56%    |

| 2024-10-31   | $2.93B  | -11.07%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **High Profit Margins:** Snowflake boasts exceptionally high profit margins (65-67%). This indicates that the core business is strong and efficient.
*   **Negative ROE:** The negative Return on Equity (ROE) reflects the company's inability to generate profits on its invested capital. This is directly tied to the persistent losses.
*   **Equity Fluctuation:** The equity balance has decreased, which warrants further investigation.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Snowflake presents a mixed picture:

*   **Positives:** Strong revenue growth, high profit margins, and a large market capitalization suggest a company with significant potential. Analyst consensus is still leaning toward "Buy".
*   **Negatives:** Underperformance relative to the S&P 500, significant historical volatility, persistent losses, negative ROE, and negative expected future returns are major red flags.  Recent news focuses on a stock price decline.

**Conclusion:**  The data suggests caution is warranted. While Snowflake's revenue growth and high profit margins are encouraging, the lack of profitability and underperformance relative to the market are significant concerns. The negative expected return is a serious signal. It is important to dig deeper into the reasons for the losses and to assess the company's path to profitability before considering an investment.
