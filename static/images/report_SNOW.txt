2026-01-06 - Analysis Report
Here's an analysis of Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) based on the data provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing company.
*   **SNOW Cumulative Return:** 23.54%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 50.12%
*   **Divergence:** -26.58
*   **Relative Divergence:** 34.6

**Analysis:** SNOW has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period. The divergence of -26.58% indicates a substantial gap in returns. The relative divergence of 34.6 suggests that SNOW's underperformance, while significant, is not at its historical worst compared to VOO.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

*   **2021-2023:** Negative CAGR (-25%), high Beta (2.0), and negative Alpha (-26%). This period suggests SNOW was much more volatile than the market and underperformed on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **2022-2024:** Similar to the previous period, negative CAGR (-26%), high Beta (2.0), and very negative Alpha (-45%) indicate continued underperformance and high volatility.
*   **2023-2025:** Positive CAGR (46%), lower Beta (1.7), but still negative Alpha (-16%).  While the stock saw positive growth, it still underperformed relative to the market on a risk-adjusted basis.

**Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta data paints a concerning picture. SNOW has generally exhibited high volatility (Beta > 1) and negative Alpha, meaning it hasn't delivered returns commensurate with its risk level compared to the market, even in periods of positive growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 216.71
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 224.36, Previous Close: 216.71, Change: 3.53
*   **5-day SMA:** 220.98
*   **20-day SMA:** 222.06
*   **60-day SMA:** 244.25

**Analysis:** SNOW's price closed at 216.71, bounced back to 224.36, but moving averages indicate a downward trend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are significantly below the 60-day SMA. The price increase of 3.53 suggests a recent rebound.

**3) Indicators Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 45.18
*   **PPO:** 0.23
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (4 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 1.5% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.6 (Negative Trend)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -41.1 (Expected underperformance compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI of 45.18 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   The PPO is close to the zero line, suggesting weak upward momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests allocating most of the cash in the portfolio to the stock (Buy 90% of cash) with a suggested monthly investment.
*   The negative divergence change indicates recent underperformance compared to its peers or the market.
*   The Expected Return of -41.1% is extremely concerning, suggesting significant potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a longer-term investment horizon.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Sentiment:**
    *   Jim Cramer's comment about Snowflake's decline showing a cohort issue.
    *   Stock slipping under $220 as insider sale filings surface.
*   **Positive Sentiment:**
    *   Analyst Coverage: Raymond James assumes coverage with an outperform rating
    *   Revenue Potential: Snowflake: Massively Underestimated Revenue Potential (SNOW)
    *   AI Potential: Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Beat Palantir in 2026.
*   **Neutral/Informative:**
    *   Earnings and Acquisition Rumors

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. Negative headlines about price drops and insider selling are concerning. Positive headlines about revenue potential and an "outperform" rating provide counterpoints. The AI potential narrative is more forward-looking and speculative. The acquisition rumours are just that until confirmed.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.59)
*   **Opinions:** 47
*   **Target Price:** Average: 283.52, High: 500.00, Low: 170.00

**Analysis:** Despite the recent price struggles, the analyst consensus is still "Buy," with a significant number of opinions.  The average target price is substantially higher than the current price, suggesting considerable upside potential according to analysts. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates considerable uncertainty among analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2025-12-05 | -0.87 | 1.21 B$     |
| 2025-09-05 | -0.89 | 1.14 B$     |

| 2025-12-05 | -0.98 | 0.94 B$     |

**Analysis:** Snowflake consistently generates high revenue, but has yet to turn a profit. While revenue is trending upward, the EPS remains negative. This is not uncommon for growth companies but should be watched closely.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-10-31   | $1.21B     | 67.77%       |
| 2025-07-31   | $1.14B     | 67.53%       |
| 2025-04-30   | $1.04B     | 66.53%       |
| 2025-01-31   | $0.99B     | 66.23%       |
| 2024-10-31   | $0.94B     | 65.94%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE         |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| 2025-10-31   | $2.13B     | -13.78%     |
| 2025-07-31   | $2.37B     | -12.56%     |
| 2025-04-30   | $2.41B     | -17.86%     |
| 2025-01-31   | $3.00B     | -10.92%     |
| 2024-10-31   | $2.93B     | -11.07%     |

**Analysis:** Revenue is consistently growing. Profit margins are extremely high, indicating strong pricing power and operational efficiency. However, negative ROE (Return on Equity) confirms that the company is not yet generating profits for its shareholders despite high revenue and gross profit margins. Equity also shows a downward trend.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Snowflake presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and underperformance relative to the market. Recent moving averages indicate a downward trend. The expected return is significantly negative. The company is not currently profitable.
*   **Positives:** Revenue is consistently growing, and profit margins are very high. Analysts, on average, maintain a "Buy" rating with a significant upside target price. Positive news headlines regarding revenue potential and AI applications offer some hope.
*   **Key Considerations:** The long-term investment thesis hinges on Snowflake's ability to leverage its high revenue growth and strong profit margins into eventual profitability. Investors should closely monitor EPS trends, ROE, and cash flow in future quarters. The insider selling and recent price declines are warning signs. The negative expected return makes it challenging to justify investment at the current time. The company needs to beat the general economic conditions and specific cloud database market conditions to overcome the negative market sentiment.
