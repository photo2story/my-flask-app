## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Performance Review

This report analyzes the performance of Snowflake Inc. (SNOW), a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company, comparing its returns to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Snowflake's cumulative return (1.50) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (73.95).  The difference is -72.4%, placing it at the 23.9th percentile of its historical range of underperformance (-108.0% to 41.2%). This indicates SNOW has substantially lagged the market.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently negative alpha values across the observed periods (2020-2025), suggesting SNOW underperformed the market benchmark.  The high beta values (47.4 to 65.7) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  While CAGR shows some positive growth (30% in 2023-2025),  the negative alpha across all periods suggests this growth was not above market expectations.  The high MDD (maximum drawdown) also highlights significant risk.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -44.0% | 21.1% | -49.0% | 47.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -7.0% | 21.1% | -30.0% | 65.7 |
| 2022-2024  | -19.0% | 21.1% | -51.0% | 51.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 30.0% | 11.8% | -0.4 | 61.4 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

SNOW's closing price is $186.12.  The price shows a slight upward trend recently.

* **Closing Price:** $186.12
* **5-day moving average:** $186.91
* **20-day moving average:** $177.72
* **60-day moving average:** $166.73

The price is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend, but it's important to consider that this is a relatively short timeframe.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (63.4):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum.
* **PPO (0.15):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **20-day Relative Strength Change (-0.4):** Shows a recent slight weakening in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-130.7%):**  This significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is concerning and warrants further investigation into the assumptions underlying this projection. The recent positive price change (+$1.14) is relatively small in context of this long-term outlook.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent net losses (negative EPS) and revenue growth.  Note the duplication of the 2024-11-27 data point.  Further investigation is needed to verify the accuracy.


| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98  | $0.94B      |
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95  | $0.87B      |
| 2024-05-31 | -$0.95  | $0.83B      |
| 2023-12-01 | -$0.65  | $0.73B      |
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65  | $0.73B      |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is steadily increasing, showing positive growth. Profit margins are also high and relatively stable, albeit showing a slight downward trend. However, the return on equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity investment.  This is a serious concern.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B | 65.94% |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B | 66.84% |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B | 67.12% |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B | 68.79% |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.73B | 68.82% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B | -11.07% |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B | -7.67% |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B | -6.95% |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B | -3.27% |
| 2023-10-31 | $4.93B | -4.35% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, despite showing revenue growth.  The consistently negative alpha, high beta, and negative ROE are major red flags. While recent price action shows some short-term upward movement, the long-term outlook appears bearish based on the provided data, particularly the projected negative expected return. The high profit margins are positive, but the negative ROE is overriding.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons behind the negative ROE and the very negative long-term expected return projection before considering any investment.  The company's high growth potential is clearly not translating into returns for investors at present.
