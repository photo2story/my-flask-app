| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($183.55) is below the 5-day ($185.80) and 20-day ($178.78) moving averages, suggesting a recent price decline and potential downward momentum. However, it is above the 60-day moving average ($167.70), indicating a longer-term upward trend. The recent price change of -$1.38 shows a small negative shift, but is not a significant drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI (56.65) is slightly above the neutral level of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.  The negative PPO (-0.05) suggests bearish momentum.  The recent relative divergence is -2.9, indicating short-term downward pressure.  The -139.5% expected return represents a significant projected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This significant negative expected return must be considered carefully.  The recent price decline (-0.74%) doesn't seem to be a large drop warranting the label "rapid decline."


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows consistent negative EPS, indicating losses across multiple quarters. Revenue is increasing, but not at a rate that compensates for the losses.  Further investigation into the reasons for persistent negative EPS is required.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98 | 0.94 B$ |
| 2024-08-29 | -0.95 | 0.87 B$ |
| 2024-05-31 | -0.95 | 0.83 B$ |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is steadily increasing, exhibiting consistent growth. Profit margins are high but show a slight downward trend.  The capital position is relatively stable, although equity shows some fluctuation. Negative ROE across all reported quarters is a major concern. This suggests the company is not generating returns on its invested capital, which is a significant issue.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake (SNOW) shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by negative alpha values and a substantially lower cumulative return. While revenue is growing, consistent negative EPS and negative ROE are serious concerns. The technical indicators present a mixed picture, with the RSI suggesting neutrality and the PPO indicating bearish momentum.  The negative long-term expected return and the consistently negative ROE raise major concerns about the long-term viability of investment in SNOW.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative EPS and negative ROE are critical before any investment decision.  A more in-depth analysis, including a review of the company's business strategy and competitive landscape, is strongly recommended before considering any investment in SNOW.
