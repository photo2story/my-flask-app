2025-02-15 - Analysis Report
## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

**0) Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Snowflake's cumulative return of 2.31% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 75.74% over the analyzed period.  The difference is -73.4%, placing it at the 23.2nd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (considering a historical range from -108% to 41.2%). This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows negative alpha values across all periods, indicating Snowflake underperformed the market benchmark.  The beta values consistently exceed 1, demonstrating higher volatility than the market (significantly higher in the early years).  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates but generally remains substantial.  Note that the provided CAGR figures don't appear to be consistent with the reported cumulative returns.  Further clarification on calculation methodology is needed.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -44.0%   | 21.1%   | -0.0  | 47.4  |        |
| 2021-2023  | -7.0%    | 21.1%   | -0.1  | 65.7  |        |
| 2022-2024  | -19.0%   | 21.1%   | -0.1  | 51.0  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 31.0%    | 11.8%   | -0.4  | 61.9  |        |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $187.60
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $187.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $182.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $170.72

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent stability. However, it's significantly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which indicates a recent upward trend.  The significant drop from the previous close (-$2.63 or -1.36%) suggests a potential short-term reversal.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (60.99):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, being in a neutral territory.
* **PPO (-0.05):** A negative value indicates bearish momentum, but it is relatively close to zero suggesting weakness rather than a strong downtrend.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-0.9):** Indicates a recent short-term decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-136.7%):**  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term raises serious concerns.  The calculation methodology needs further explanation to understand this dramatic projection.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Snowflake has reported negative EPS in recent quarters, indicating ongoing losses. Revenue is growing steadily but at a decreasing rate.  The repeated entry for 2024-11-27 suggests a data entry error.  Clarification is needed to ensure the accuracy of this data.

| Date        | EPS    | Revenue     |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27  | -$0.98 | $0.94B      |
| 2024-08-29  | -$0.95 | $0.87B      |
| 2024-05-31  | -$0.95 | $0.83B      |
| 2023-12-01  | -$0.65 | $0.73B      |
| 2024-11-27  | -$0.65 | $0.73B      |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows steady growth, while profit margins remain high but have shown slight downward trends over time.  The Equity shows some fluctuation and the ROE is negative, indicating that the company is not yet generating returns on its equity investment.  However, the negative ROE has improved recently.


| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity | ROE      |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------|----------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B   | 65.94%        | $2.93B  | -11.07%  |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B   | 66.84%        | $4.13B  | -7.67%   |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B   | 67.12%        | $4.56B  | -6.95%   |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B   | 68.79%        | $5.18B  | -3.27%   |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.73B   | 68.82%        | $4.93B  | -4.35%   |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, exhibiting negative alpha and high beta. While revenue is growing, the company is still unprofitable, as indicated by negative EPS and ROE.  Technical indicators show a neutral RSI and slightly bearish PPO. The extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 requires careful examination of the methodology used to obtain this figure.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entries in earnings data and inconsistencies between CAGR and cumulative return) necessitates further clarification and data validation before drawing definitive conclusions.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons for the persistent underperformance and the methodology behind the projected -136.7% return.  Currently, the investment outlook appears unfavorable relative to the S&P 500.
