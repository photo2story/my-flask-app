**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Overall:** SNOW presents a mixed picture. It is a high-growth company with strong revenue growth and profit margins, but it is not yet profitable. Recent stock price action is positive, and analyst sentiment is bullish. However, SNOW has underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Risks:** High volatility (as evidenced by the MDD), ongoing losses, negative expected return.
*   **Opportunities:** Continued revenue growth, potential for profitability as the company scales, positive analyst sentiment, and partnerships.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the high MRI rating, strong analyst sentiment, recent bullish press, the "hybrid signal" suggesting this stock is low risk and is still only given a "medium investment" signal from the MRI, further research is recommended as to why the expected return is negative. Until that issue can be investigated, caution is advised.
