**0) Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Snowflake's cumulative return (1.62) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 23.68.  The difference is -22.1%, placing it at the 43.7th percentile of the historical range of divergence (max: 45.5%, min: -74.5%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently negative alpha values across all periods (2020-2025), suggesting Snowflake underperformed the market.  However, the high beta values (ranging from 48.0 to 66.5) indicate significant market sensitivity; SNOW's price movements are substantially amplified compared to the overall market.  The negative CAGR across multiple periods further highlights underperformance.  Note that Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is high, showing significant potential for losses.

|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98  | $0.94 B     |

**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is growing steadily, demonstrating increasing market adoption. However, the profit margins, while high, are not translating into positive ROE, indicating that despite revenue growth, the company is not yet generating sufficient returns on its equity. This warrants further investigation into the company's expense structure and capital allocation strategies.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $0.99B  | 66.23%        |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B  | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B  | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B  | 67.12%        |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B  | 68.79%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE         |

| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B  | -11.07%      |

| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B  | -3.27%       |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's stock performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, exhibiting negative alpha and high beta.  While revenue is growing, consistent negative EPS and negative ROE raise significant concerns about profitability and long-term sustainability.  Technical indicators suggest an overbought condition, with potential for a price correction.  The projected negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 further highlights the risk associated with this investment.  Before considering an investment, a thorough analysis of the company's strategy to achieve profitability and improve its return on equity is crucial.  The high risk associated with SNOW's volatility should also be carefully considered.  The data strongly suggests caution is advised.
