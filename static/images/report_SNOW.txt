**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -46.0% | 70.5% | -47.0% | -0.1 | 47.9 |
| 2021-2023  | -33.0% | 70.5% | -51.0% | -0.0 | 66.4 |
| 2022-2024  | -13.0% | 73.9% | -39.0% | -0.0 | 51.5 |
| 2023-2025  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 13.0% | -0.0 | 70.8 |

*   **CAGR:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies significantly across different periods. Note the periods of negative CAGR, indicating periods of significant losses. The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a strong positive CAGR.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is very high across all periods, indicating significant potential losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative, especially in earlier periods, which means that the investment is performing worse than the benchmark after adjusting for risk. The 2023-2025 period shows positive alpha.
*   **Beta:** Beta is close to zero, suggesting SNOW's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). This is a bit unusual for a growth stock.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization in billions.

**2. Recent Price Action Analysis**

The current price of $212.25 is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages ($213.66 and $217.86 respectively), but above the 60-day moving average ($200.18).  This suggests potential short-term downward momentum, but the price is still supported by the longer-term trend.  The small decrease from the previous close indicates a slight pullback.

**3. Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator is at 0.3359, indicating a low-risk environment.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 45.28 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is at -0.75, which is slightly bearish, indicating that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is important. It suggests a high cash position (69%) and potentially selling 1% of holdings, signaling caution, influenced by the MRI.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence (-0.7) signals a short-term underperformance against the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The very low Expected Return (-66.3%) is a major red flag. This suggests models predict significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a longer investment horizon.

*   **Risk Assessment:** The MRI suggests a low-risk environment, but the hybrid signal indicates caution. The high MDD values are a significant consideration.
*   **Investment Recommendation:**  Based on the provided data, a *cautious* approach is warranted.  The negative Expected Return and negative EPS/ROE are significant concerns.  The stock appears to be supported by the 60-day moving average, but a break below this level could signal further downside.
*   **Key Considerations:** Investors should closely monitor SNOW's ability to improve profitability, maintain revenue growth, and manage its equity. The high MDD suggests that SNOW is likely to continue to be a volatile investment.
*   **Further Research:** Additional research is needed to understand the reasons behind the negative Expected Return and to assess the long-term growth potential of Snowflake Inc.

In conclusion, Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) presents a mixed picture. While it operates in a growing market and maintains a high profit margin on revenue, its negative profitability, declining equity, and significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 warrant caution.
