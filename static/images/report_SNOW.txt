    | 2023-2025  | 46.0%   | 79.8% | -19.0%  | -0.0  | 74.6   |

    *   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows volatile performance. Recent years (2020-2024) experienced negative CAGR. The 2023-2025 period shows a strong positive CAGR, but it comes after a period of underperformance.
    *   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is very high across all periods, indicating significant risk and volatility.
    *   **Alpha:**  Negative Alpha consistently suggests that SNOW is underperforming relative to its benchmark index and not generating excess returns based on its risk (Beta).
    *   **Beta:** Beta values close to 0 indicate that SNOW's price is not highly correlated with the S&P 500.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization shows the company is a large cap company.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 217.93
*   **Recent Change:** Decreased by -1.17 from previous close (220.51).

    *   20-day SMA: 242.02
    *   60-day SMA: 246.22

    The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The gap between the 5-day SMA and the longer-term averages (20-day and 60-day) indicates recent price weakness.

**3) Indicators Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment) - While still relatively high, indicates the stock is not extremely risky from this perspective, but not a 'safe' investment either.
*   **RSI:** 41.20 - This is below 50, but not yet in oversold territory (typically below 30), so it suggests some selling pressure, but not extreme.
*   **PPO:** -1.61 - A negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, reinforcing the downtrend signal.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (4 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) - The model suggests buying a significant portion of available cash, despite concerns.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -5.2 (short-term decline) - Confirms recent underperformance relative to the comparison index.
*   **Expected Return:** -44.1% - A significantly negative expected return suggests that the model forecasts SNOW to underperform significantly over the next two years.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Earnings Sell-Off & Underwhelming Outlook:** Multiple articles (Barron's, Investor's Business Daily, Forbes) highlight a stock price decline following earnings, attributed to an underwhelming outlook.
*   **Analyst Optimism vs. Reality:** While Wall Street was bullish before the fiscal Q3 2026 results (Yahoo Finance), the actual results and outlook seem to have disappointed.
*   **Founder Stock Sale:** The sale of stock by a founder (Investing.com) might create negative sentiment, although the amount ($181k) might not be materially significant.
*   **AI Mega-Deals:** While mentioned in one headline, the details of these deals and their impact on SNOW's stock price are not immediately clear from the provided information.

*Important observation here is that most of the news articles have the same date. This should be a critical item to review if the news sources are from different dates or if the collection of data is incorrect.*

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** "Buy" with a mean rating of 1.59.
*   **Target Price:** Average target of $282.06, indicating potential upside. Wide range ($170 - $500) shows considerable disagreement among analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출      |
|------------|-------|-----------|

| 2025-09-05 | -0.89 | 1.14 B$   |

| 2025-12-05 | -0.98 | 0.94 B$   |

*   **EPS:** Consistently negative Earnings Per Share (EPS) indicates the company is not yet profitable. While there's some fluctuation, the negative values persist.
*   **Revenue:** Revenue is growing sequentially, which is positive. However, the lack of profitability is a concern.

**6) Financial Information**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**

    | Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
    |--------------|---------|---------------|
    | 2025-10-31   | $1.21B  | 67.77%        |
    | 2025-07-31   | $1.14B  | 67.53%        |
    | 2025-04-30   | $1.04B  | 66.53%        |
    | 2025-01-31   | $0.99B  | 66.23%        |
    | 2024-10-31   | $0.94B  | 65.94%        |

    Revenue is increasing consistently over the quarters. The profit margin is exceptionally high. This means that Snowflake is generating a significant amount of gross profit from its revenue. This is very good.

*   **Capital and Profitability:**

    | Quarter      | Equity  | ROE       |
    |--------------|---------|-----------|
    | 2025-10-31   | $2.13B  | -13.78%   |
    | 2025-07-31   | $2.37B  | -12.56%   |
    | 2025-04-30   | $2.41B  | -17.86%   |
    | 2025-01-31   | $3.00B  | -10.92%   |
    | 2024-10-31   | $2.93B  | -11.07%   |

    Equity is fluctuating, with a recent decrease. Negative Return on Equity (ROE) confirms the company's lack of profitability. This must be looked at.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Overall Picture:** SNOW is a high-growth company with strong revenue growth and high profit margins. However, it is currently unprofitable and underperforming the broader market. Recent earnings results and outlook appear to have disappointed investors, leading to a stock price decline.
*   **Positives:** Strong revenue growth, high profit margins, positive analyst consensus (although target prices vary widely).
*   **Negatives:** Lack of profitability (negative EPS and ROE), high valuation, recent stock price decline, negative expected return, high MDD, and founder stock sale.
*   **Investment Recommendation:** Based on this data, a cautious approach is warranted. While the analyst consensus is still "Buy," the recent news, price action, and negative expected return suggest significant risks. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in SNOW. Waiting for signs of improving profitability and a more stable outlook might be prudent. If one decides to invest in this company, it would be suitable to invest a small amount.
