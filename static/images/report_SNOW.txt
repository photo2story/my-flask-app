## 6. Revenue, Margin & Capital Overview  

### Revenue & Profitability  

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| 2025‑10‑31 | $1.21 B | 67.77 % |
| 2025‑07‑31 | $1.14 B | 67.53 % |
| 2025‑04‑30 | $1.04 B | 66.53 % |
| 2025‑01‑31 | $0.99 B | 66.23 % |
| 2024‑10‑31 | $0.94 B | 65.94 % |

**Insight:** Revenue growth is steady and margins are healthy (> 65 %), but the figures represent *gross* profitability; net results remain negative due to high operating costs.

### Capital & Return on Equity  

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|--------|-----|
| 2025‑10‑31 | $2.13 B | ‑13.78 % |
| 2025‑07‑31 | $2.37 B | ‑12.56 % |
| 2025‑04‑30 | $2.41 B | ‑17.86 % |
| 2025‑01‑31 | $3.00 B | ‑10.92 % |
| 2024‑10‑31 | $2.93 B | ‑11.07 % |

**Takeaway:**  
- Equity is declining as losses accumulate, pushing ROE into negative territory.  
- A negative ROE indicates the company is not yet generating shareholder returns.

## 7. Comprehensive Take‑away  

- **Performance Gap:** SNOW’s cumulative return trails the S&P 500 by ~30 %, and the relative divergence (≈ 33rd percentile) suggests it is not in a historically strong zone.  
- **Volatility & Alpha:** With a Beta ≈ 2 and negative Alpha, the stock is both riskier and under‑performing its benchmark.  
- **Technical View:** Trading below short‑term SMAs and below the 60‑day SMA indicates a bearish short‑term bias. RSI near 50 and modest PPO confirm lack of strong momentum.  
- **Fundamentals:** Revenue is growing, margins remain high, but net losses and negative ROE show the company is still in a loss‑making phase. EPS is improving but still negative.  
- **Analyst Sentiment:** Bullish consensus with a wide target range; the current price is below the mean target, leaving upside potential but also risk.  
- **News Pulse:** Recent headlines highlight a 45 % rally over the past year, but the latest market dip suggests volatility and potential correction.

**Bottom line:**  
Snowflake is a growth‑oriented cloud data‑platform that shows solid revenue growth and healthy margins yet remains unprofitable and volatile. The stock under‑performs the market, has a negative long‑term expected return, and carries medium risk. Investors should weigh the upside potential against the high volatility and negative fundamentals before committing.
