* **CAGR:** Recent years have seen both significant negative CAGR and a sharp turnaround in 2023-2025
* **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values indicate substantial risk
* **Alpha:** SNOW has consistently underperformed relative to its benchmark, except for the most recent period
* **Beta:** Beta values are close to zero or slightly negative, suggesting SNOW is not closely correlated to the market.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Previous Close:** 256.92
*   **Change:** 0.04
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 264.706
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 262.6503
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 239.4506

**Analysis:** The slight price increase indicates minimal momentum. The current price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting potential short-term downward pressure. However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend. The negligible change from the previous close suggests a lack of significant price movement.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI:** 40.76 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.89 (Potentially Bearish - below zero suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term average)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **20-day Relative Disparity Change:** -3.6 (Short-Term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -16.6% (Long-Term Underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**  The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium investment risk. The RSI is neutral. The negative PPO indicates potential weakness. The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy recommendation but it does contradict with expected return. The negative change in relative disparity over the past 20 days reinforces the short-term downward trend. The expected return is concerning, suggesting potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term. The {'price': 257.02, 'previousClose': 256.92, 'change': 0.04} shows there is no significant fluctuations in price.
