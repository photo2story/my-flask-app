The difference is a substantial -85.0%, placing it in the 15.4th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $169.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $142.78

* **Expected Return (-223.1%):** This extremely negative expected return, particularly considering the timeframe (2+ years) and comparison to the S&P 500, is a significant red flag and requires further investigation into the methodology used to calculate this value.  It's likely inaccurate or based on unusually pessimistic assumptions.
* **Last Market Price (156.82):**  The last market price is higher than the closing price, suggesting a potential slight upward movement. However, given the broader trend, this should be viewed with caution and requires more context.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500, a persistent negative EPS trend, and negative ROE, despite consistent revenue growth. While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, the negative PPO, downward price trend, and overall weak financial performance raise serious concerns.  The exceptionally negative projected return (-223.1%) needs further clarification regarding its calculation methodology. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more comprehensive assessment of current market sentiment.  Investors should carefully evaluate the long-term sustainability of the business model and management's ability to improve profitability before considering investment.  Further research into the company's competitive landscape and future growth prospects is vital.
