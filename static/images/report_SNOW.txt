Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  As of the last data point, SNOW's cumulative return is -8.00%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 79.45%. This represents a significant divergence of -87.4%, placing it at the 16.7th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  The substantial underperformance compared to the market benchmark is evident.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $174.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $171.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $138.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $122.71

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, although the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average may indicate potential consolidation or a minor upward correction.  The significant gap between the current price and the 20-day and 60-day moving averages shows how recent the price increase is.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 86.53 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction could be imminent.
* **PPO:** 3.16 – A positive PPO suggests upward momentum, but the value alone doesn't provide a strong buy/sell signal without further context.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN – The absence of data prevents meaningful analysis here.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% –  The provided expected return of 0% relative to the S&P 500 suggests that, based on the current analysis, long-term (2+ years) investment in SNOW is not expected to significantly outperform the S&P 500.  This should be considered alongside the risk profile.  The recent sharp price increase to overbought RSI levels increases short-term downside risk.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistent trend of negative EPS over the reported quarters, despite revenue growth.  Revenue is increasing, showing a clear upward trend (0.73B to 0.94B). However, the company continues to report net losses, with EPS slightly improving from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024 (-0.95 to -0.65).  There is no information on whether these results met or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows consistent quarter-over-quarter growth, but profit margins have slightly decreased, suggesting increasing costs may be offsetting revenue gains.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has decreased significantly in recent quarters. ROE is negative, indicating the company is not generating a return on shareholder equity, likely due to the ongoing net losses.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions were provided.  Information on market outlook is lacking.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SNOW shows strong revenue growth but persistent net losses, resulting in negative EPS and ROE.  The stock price has recently experienced a significant increase, pushing the RSI into overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term pullback is possible. While long-term growth potential might exist due to its position in the cloud data market, the current financial performance raises concerns.  The substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and the lack of positive alpha, combined with the overbought conditions, suggest caution before investing.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative EPS and the recent price jump is recommended before making any investment decisions.  More detailed financial analysis, including a deeper look at operating expenses and profitability beyond profit margins, is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation.  The absence of recent news and analyst opinions limits the depth of this analysis.
