The initial years (2020-2024) reflect negative growth, but the most recent period (2023-2025) shows strong growth at 69.0%.

*   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative, suggesting SNOW has underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis for most periods. However, recent Alpha is positive at 6.0%.
*   **Beta:** Beta is close to zero or slightly negative, suggesting SNOW's price movement is not strongly correlated with the overall market.

The lack of recent rating changes provided makes it difficult to assess current sentiment shifts.

### 5. Recent Earnings Analysis

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |

| 2025-09-05 | -0.89 | 1.14 B$      |

| 2025-09-05 | -0.95 | 0.87 B$      |

**Analysis:**

While revenue has shown consistent growth over the quarters, the Earnings Per Share (EPS) remains negative. The EPS fluctuates, with the most recent value being -0.89. This pattern indicates that although Snowflake is growing its revenue, it is not yet profitable.

### 6. Financial Information

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-07-31 | $1.14B   | 67.53%        |
| 2025-04-30 | $1.04B   | 66.53%        |
| 2025-01-31 | $0.99B   | 66.23%        |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B   | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B   | 66.84%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE       |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-07-31 | $2.37B   | -12.56%   |
| 2025-04-30 | $2.41B   | -17.86%   |

| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B   | -7.67%    |

**Analysis:**

Revenue is consistently increasing quarter over quarter, and the profit margin remains very high. However, the negative Return on Equity (ROE) values are concerning, as they indicate that the company is not generating profits from its equity investments. The equity also declines from 2024-07-31.

### 7. Overall Summary

*   **Mixed Signals:** SNOW presents a mixed picture. Revenue is growing strongly, analysts are generally positive, and recent news highlights product improvements and a "Buy" rating. However, the stock is currently underperforming the S&P 500, expected returns are negative, and the company is not yet profitable based on EPS and ROE.
*   **Growth vs. Profitability:** The key question is whether Snowflake can translate its revenue growth into profitability. The high profit margins are promising, but the negative ROE indicates inefficiencies in leveraging equity.
*   **Risk Factors:** High MDD, the potential impact of broader AI stock market turbulence, and negative expected returns are significant risk factors to consider.
*   **Recommendation:** Hold the stock. If it is not in the portfolio, consider it as a long-term speculative growth stock. Requires careful monitoring of profitability and market conditions. The stock's high valuation and reliance on continued revenue growth make it sensitive to negative news or market corrections.
