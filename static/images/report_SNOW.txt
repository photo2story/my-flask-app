Recent price action indicates a sharp upturn but technical indicators suggest overbought conditions and potential for a pullback. Negative ROE and consistently negative EPS are substantial concerns.

Based on the provided data, investing in SNOW currently presents high risk.  While revenue growth is positive, consistent unprofitability, negative ROE, and significant underperformance against the market are major red flags.

A thorough analysis of the latest news, analyst expectations, and a deeper dive into the company's long-term growth prospects are strongly recommended before any investment decision.  Considering the high risk, investors with a higher risk tolerance and long-term horizon should only consider a small allocation after comprehensive due diligence.
