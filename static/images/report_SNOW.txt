**Recommendation:** Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is warranted. While the analyst consensus and recent news suggest potential upside, the lack of profitability and underperformance relative to the market are significant red flags. Investors should closely monitor the company's progress toward profitability and be aware of the risks involved. The hybrid signal suggests a partial buy. The extremely negative expected return warrants caution.
