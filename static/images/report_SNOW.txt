2025-04-15 - Analysis Report
## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

**0. Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Snowflake (SNOW) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The cumulative return for SNOW is -14.89%, while VOO shows a 14.84% return. This represents a difference of -29.7%, placing it at the 35.7th percentile of the historical range (-71.5% to 45.5%).  The provided alpha and beta analysis further illustrates this underperformance.  Negative alpha consistently indicates underperformance relative to the market benchmark (S&P 500), while the high beta (consistently above 48) suggests significant volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The high beta partially explains the significant underperformance during the 2020-2022 bear market (-46% CAGR). While the CAGR improved significantly toward 2023-2025 (26%), it still indicates volatile growth.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $144.55
* **5-day Moving Average:** $143.72
* **20-day Moving Average:** $149.45
* **60-day Moving Average:** $166.36

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price drop of -$0.28 (-0.19%) is relatively minor and doesn't signal a significant market event such as a "sharp drop" or "sharp rebound."


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk) indicating increased volatility.
* **RSI:** 37.98 (below 40, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.2544 (positive, but low, suggesting weak momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -66.3% This extremely negative expected return is concerning and requires further investigation into its derivation.  It contrasts sharply with the other data points.  Given the high beta and negative alpha, a long-term (2+ years) investment may still underperform the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98  | $0.94 B       |
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95  | $0.87 B       |
| 2024-05-31 | -$0.95  | $0.83 B       |
| 2023-12-01 | -$0.65  | $0.73 B       |
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65  | $0.73 B       |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for November 27th, 2024.  The consistent negative EPS indicates that Snowflake is not yet profitable.  Revenue is growing, but at a slower pace than previous periods and it doesn't offset the negative earnings.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $0.99B | 66.23%      |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B | 65.94%      |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B | 66.84%      |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B | 67.12%      |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B | 68.79%      |

Revenue is steadily increasing, but the consistently high profit margin isn't translating to positive EPS, possibly indicating high operating expenses.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity  | ROE       |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2025-01-31 | $3.00B  | -10.92%   |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B  | -11.07%   |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B  | -7.67%    |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B  | -6.95%    |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B  | -3.27%    |

Negative ROE consistently highlights the company's unprofitability despite growing revenue.  The decrease in equity from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024 also warrants further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake exhibits strong revenue growth but suffers from persistent losses and negative profitability.  While the high profit margin is positive, it's not enough to offset operational expenses.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, showing high volatility and sensitivity to market conditions. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but the extremely negative projected return (-66.3%) raises major concerns.  Further investigation is needed to understand the basis for this projected return and to assess the sustainability of its revenue growth and its potential for future profitability.  Currently, the risk/reward ratio appears unfavorable for investment, but a deeper dive into the company's specific operational expenses, strategic initiatives and future projections would be necessary before making a conclusive statement.  The provided data suggests a cautious approach is warranted.
