**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The Medium Investment recommendation suggests moderate risk.

*   **PPO:** The negative PPO (-0.80) indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, generally suggesting a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 90% of cash" signal suggests a bullish outlook, which may contradict other indicators.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The positive change in relative divergence indicates a recent short-term upward price movement.
*   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return (-40.2%) is a major concern and suggests analysts anticipate continued underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean:** 1.59 (~Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 46
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 283.16 / 500.00 / 170.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:**  (Empty - no rating changes provided)

**Analysis:**  Despite recent struggles, the analyst consensus remains a "Buy," with a significant average target price of $283.16, well above the current price. The wide range between the high and low target prices ($500 vs $170) reflects considerable disagreement among analysts about the stock's future potential. The lack of recent rating changes could indicate that analysts haven't yet fully adjusted their models in response to the latest earnings report.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-10-31   | $1.21B    | 67.77%        |

|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-10-31   | $2.13B    | -13.78%   |

| 2024-10-31   | $2.93B    | -11.07%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Consistent quarterly revenue growth is positive.
*   **Profit Margin:** A high and increasing profit margin (around 66-68%) is a strong indicator of Snowflake's pricing power and operational efficiency.
*   **Equity:** Equity fluctuates, indicating potential changes in the company's assets and liabilities.
*   **ROE:** The negative Return on Equity (ROE) reflects the company's current unprofitability.

**7) Comprehensive Summary:**

Snowflake is a high-growth, but currently unprofitable, cloud-based data warehousing company. It is significantly underperforming the S&P 500.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Revenue Growth vs. Profitability:** Snowflake shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins, but continues to struggle with profitability (negative EPS and ROE). This is a common scenario for growth-oriented tech companies that are investing heavily in expansion. The market seems concerned about the timeframe for profitability.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Mixed signals. The RSI suggests a potential oversold condition, but the PPO indicates a downtrend. The hybrid signal advocates for a buy, but the negative expected return is concerning.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analyst consensus is still "Buy," but the wide target price range suggests uncertainty. The lack of recent rating changes may mean adjustments are forthcoming.
*   **Recent News:** The post-earnings stock drop due to an underwhelming outlook highlights the risk associated with high-growth companies where future expectations are baked into the stock price.
*   **Volatility:** The high MDD underscores the stock's significant volatility.

**Overall Recommendation (Cautious):**

Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted. While Snowflake has strong fundamentals (revenue growth, high profit margins, a leading market position), its lack of profitability and the market's recent negative reaction to its outlook are concerning.

**Potential Investment Strategy:**

*   **Consider a small position:** If you believe in the long-term potential of cloud data warehousing and Snowflake's market leadership, consider a small, speculative position.
*   **Monitor Earnings Closely:** Pay close attention to future earnings reports and management guidance, particularly regarding the path to profitability.
*   **Watch for Analyst Revisions:** Look for analyst rating changes to gauge how professionals are reacting to the recent events.
*   **Technical Confirmation:** Consider waiting for technical confirmation of a trend reversal (e.g., a break above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs) before increasing your position.

**Risks:**

*   **Competition:** The cloud data warehousing market is competitive.
*   **Valuation:** Snowflake's valuation is high, making it susceptible to price corrections if growth slows or profitability is delayed.
*   **Execution:** Snowflake needs to effectively execute its growth strategy and achieve profitability to justify its current valuation.
