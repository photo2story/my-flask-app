## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  Currently, the stock significantly underperforms the S&P 500, showing negative returns while the benchmark index exhibits strong positive growth.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, but fundamental analysis reveals concerns regarding profitability and negative ROE.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Snowflake's cumulative return of -13.21% significantly lags the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 62.52%, resulting in a substantial divergence (-75.7%). This places it in the 21.6th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals consistently negative alpha values across different periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market.  The high and fluctuating beta values (47.4 to 65.7) suggest high market sensitivity and volatility.  The consistently negative CAGR across the periods further supports the underperformance.


| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -44.0% | 21.1%  | -0.0  | 47.4  |       |
| 2021-2023  | -7.0%  | 21.1%  | -0.1  | 65.7  |       |
| 2022-2024  | -19.0% | 21.1%  | -0.1  | 51.0  |       |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $158.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $167.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $177.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $172.65

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price increase (1.72%) might be a temporary bounce within this larger trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 31.53 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound, but not confirming it)
* **PPO:** -1.48 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.5 (Short-term downward trend)

The significant price change of 1.72%  from the previous close might signal a short-term rebound, but this needs further confirmation. The expected return of -153.1% relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) suggests significant underperformance even with a long-term investment strategy.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's stock currently underperforms the market significantly, as evidenced by negative cumulative returns, negative alpha, high beta, and negative ROE. While revenue is growing, the company is not yet profitable, and the negative ROE raises serious concerns. Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, which might present an opportunity for a short-term bounce. However, the fundamental issues need to be addressed before considering a long-term investment.  Investors should carefully monitor the company's progress in achieving profitability and improving its ROE before making any investment decisions.  The current negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 further supports caution.  The duplicate data point in the earnings data warrants investigation for data accuracy.
