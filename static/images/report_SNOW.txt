2025-12-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down the analysis of Snowflake (SNOW) based on the provided data.

**0) Report Language: English**

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** SNOW
*   **Company Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing company.
*   **SNOW Cumulative Return:** 27.23%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 54.02%
*   **Divergence:** Current: -26.8, Relative Divergence: 36.1

**Analysis:** Snowflake has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. The relative divergence of 36.1 suggests that the current divergence is in the lower end of its historical range. This means the underperformance versus the S&P 500 isn't as extreme as it has been at times in the past, but it's still a substantial gap.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -25.0% | 75.3% | -9.0% | 0.0 | 49.7 |
| 2021-2023  | -25.0% | 78.3% | -27.0% | 0.1 | 68.9 |
| 2022-2024  | -26.0% | 78.3% | -46.0% | 0.1 | 53.5 |
| 2023-2025  | 48.0% | 79.8% | -17.0% | -0.0 | 77.0 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is highly variable, with negative returns in the earlier periods followed by a strong positive return in the most recent period.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk in SNOW's price.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is consistently negative, indicating that SNOW has underperformed relative to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are close to zero, suggesting low sensitivity to market movements. However, the substantial difference in cumulative return relative to the S&P 500, makes the Beta questionable and unreliable.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates over the periods.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 222.46
*   **Last Market Price:** 225.1, Previous Close: 226.84, Change: -0.77
*   **5-day SMA:** 219.19
*   **20-day SMA:** 233.72
*   **60-day SMA:** 245.70

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This suggests a short-term downtrend (price below 5-day SMA) and that recent price weakness has pushed the price below the longer-term averages.  The negative change in the last market also indicates continued downward pressure.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 25.98 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.50
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (4 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.4 (+): 단기상승
*   **Expected Return (%):** -40.0

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI is in oversold territory (below 30), which *could* indicate a potential for a price reversal, but doesn't guarantee it.
*   The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being negative indicates the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average.
*   The hybrid signal suggests a buy signal, allocating 90% of cash into SNOW.
*   The positive change in recent relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend.
*   The expected return of -40% is *very* negative and suggests a pessimistic outlook for the stock's long-term performance, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Raymond James Assumes Coverage with an Outperform Rating.
    *   Snowflake Price Prediction and Forecast 2025-2030 (January 2026) - positive outlook
*   **Negative:**

    *   Snowflake Shares Melt.
*   **Neutral/Mixed:**
    *   Should You Buy, Sell, or Hold Snowflake Stock Post Q3 Earnings?

**Analysis:** Recent news presents a mixed picture. While an analyst firm initiating coverage with an "Outperform" rating is positive, insider selling (Emily Ho) can be perceived negatively. The article about shares "melting" suggests recent price weakness and raises concerns. The prediction article offers some positive outlook. The Motley Fool article suggests this is a good time to "Buy the Stock on the Dip", but this opinion is contrasted in other headlines.

*   **Opinions:** 46
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 283.16, High: 500.00, Low: 170.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and a significant number of opinions. The average target price is well above the current price, indicating potential upside, but the wide range between high and low targets reveals uncertainty among analysts.

*   **Equity:** Equity has decreased since 2025-01-31.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) is negative, reflecting the company's unprofitability. While the company generates significant revenue and maintains high margins, expenses are outweighing revenue.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Snowflake presents a mixed picture. Here's a summary of the key takeaways:

*   **Underperformance:** Snowflake has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** High Maximum Drawdown and volatile price action demonstrate significant risk.
*   **Growth:** Revenue is growing rapidly, and gross profit margins are strong.
*   **Unprofitability:** The company is not currently profitable, with negative EPS and ROE.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators are giving mixed signals (oversold RSI vs. downtrending SMAs). Analyst consensus is generally positive, but the negative expected return tempers this enthusiasm. Recent news is also a mix of positive and negative developments.
*   **Valuation:** Snowflake's current price relies on its high growth being maintained. If growth slows, the stock may underperform the market.

**Conclusion:** While Snowflake has potential for future growth, the underperformance versus the S&P 500, negative profitability metrics, and recent price weakness suggest caution. The company's valuation relies heavily on sustained high growth. The analyst ratings and high target prices suggest that the "Buy" consensus is based on continued growth prospects. The negative expected return suggests a more cautious outlook. The investor needs to carefully weigh the growth prospects against the current risks and the existing divergence from the market benchmark.
