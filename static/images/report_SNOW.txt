**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has reported negative EPS for the recent quarters, showing continuous losses. While revenue is growing, the lack of profitability is concerning.  It's crucial to investigate the reasons behind these losses.  Note the duplicate entry for 2024-11-27.


| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출       |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98  | 0.94 B$    |

| 2024-11-27 | -0.65  | 0.73 B$    |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows consistent growth, while profit margins remain high.  However, the negative ROE across all quarters is a serious concern, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  Further investigation into the reasons behind negative ROE (e.g., high debt, significant investments) is necessary.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Snowflake (SNOW) has shown significant underperformance against the S&P 500. While revenue is growing and profit margins are high, the persistent negative EPS and, more importantly, negative ROE raise serious concerns about the company's profitability and long-term sustainability. The high beta indicates substantial market risk.  The recent price increase might be a short-term rally.  A thorough investigation into the reasons behind negative EPS and ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 reinforces these concerns.  Investors should carefully consider these factors and conduct further due diligence before investing.
