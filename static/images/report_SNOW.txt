| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- | ------- | ------ | ------ |

    *   Price: 222.53

*   **RSI:** 47.16 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)

*   The RSI is neutral.
*   The negative PPO and decreasing relative disparity point to potential continued short-term underperformance.

**Analysis:** The news flow seems positive, highlighting Snowflake's role as a platform for data and AI-driven solutions.  These partnerships could contribute to future growth, but the current financial metrics need to be considered in conjunction with these developments.

### 7. Overall Analysis

Snowflake (SNOW) presents a mixed picture. The company is experiencing strong revenue growth and has high profit margins. It's also forging partnerships that could drive future innovation.

**However:**

*   It's significantly underperforming the S&P 500 and is projected to continue to do so.
*   It is currently unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE.
*   Technical indicators are mixed, with bearish signals from PPO and a recent decrease in relative performance.

**Conclusion:**

SNOW is a high-growth company in an attractive sector, but it carries significant risk. The analyst consensus is positive, but the wide range in target prices highlights the uncertainty.  Investors should carefully weigh the growth potential against the lack of current profitability and relative underperformance before investing. A more conservative approach, as suggested by the hybrid signal, might be prudent.
