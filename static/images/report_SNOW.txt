**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of SNOW is $146.54, slightly above the 5-day moving average ($146.33) but below both the 20-day ($149.06) and 60-day ($165.95) moving averages. This suggests a recent price decline and potential bearish trend. The recent increase of $1.38 from the previous close indicates a minor bounce, not a significant reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 41.19 indicates that SNOW is currently in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a short-term bounce, but not a clear reversal of the downward trend. The PPO of 0.48 shows some bullish momentum, but this is relatively weak.  The recent relative divergence shows a short-term upward movement, which is consistent with the minor price bounce.  The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.4175 suggests a medium risk level. The significant negative expected return (-64.7%) over the long term highlights the substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent negative EPS throughout the period, indicating ongoing losses.  Revenue is growing steadily, but not fast enough to offset the losses.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98   | $0.94 B     |
| 2024-08-29 | -0.95   | $0.87 B     |
| 2024-05-31 | -0.95   | $0.83 B     |
| 2023-12-01 | -0.65   | $0.73 B     |
| 2024-11-27 | -0.65   | $0.73 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue growth shows a positive trend, with profit margins remaining consistently high (above 65%). However, the negative ROE values over the last few quarters are alarming, particularly the significant drop in equity observed in 2024-10-31.  This negative ROE alongside negative EPS strongly suggests an unsustainable financial model.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31  | $0.99B    | 66.23%        |
| 2024-10-31  | $0.94B    | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31  | $0.87B    | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30  | $0.83B    | 67.12%        |
| 2024-01-31  | $0.77B    | 68.79%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity    | ROE          |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's performance is currently underwhelming, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. While revenue shows growth, consistent negative EPS and ROE raise serious concerns about the company's profitability and financial health.  The high beta suggests high volatility, making it a risky investment. Although some short-term indicators hint at potential rebounds, the long-term outlook remains negative given the consistently negative expected return.  A thorough review of the company's strategy and financial plans is necessary before considering investment.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative ROE and EPS is crucial.  The substantial drop in equity in Q4 2024 is particularly worrisome and requires explanation.
