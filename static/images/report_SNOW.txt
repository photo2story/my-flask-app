Investors should carefully consider the high volatility and lack of profitability before investing.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative EPS and the long-term growth strategy is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current data paints a picture of a high-risk, high-volatility investment with limited near-term upside potential.
