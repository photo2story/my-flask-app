* **Closing Price:** $187.60
* **Last Traded Price:** $192.78 (a recent jump)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $187.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $182.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $170.72

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, and significantly above its 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent price increase. The last traded price shows a considerable jump compared to the previous close.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.99 (slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.05 (slightly negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Deviation Change:** -0.9 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, vs. S&P 500):** -136.7% (Significantly negative)

The recent price jump of $2.76 from the previous close reflects a significant short-term uptrend, contradicting the negative PPO and relative deviation change.  The extremely negative long-term expected return highlights a significant risk if investing in SNOW relative to the broader market, despite the recent price increase.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -0.98   | $0.94B        |
| 2024-08-29 | -0.95   | $0.87B        |
| 2024-05-31 | -0.95   | $0.83B        |
| 2023-12-01 | -0.65   | $0.73B        |
| 2024-11-27 | -0.65   | $0.73B        | *(Duplicate entry, likely error)*

Snowflake continues to report negative EPS, indicating that the company is not yet profitable. Revenue is showing consistent growth, but this positive trend needs to be considered in conjunction with the sustained losses.  The duplicate entry suggests potential data inconsistencies.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B   | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B   | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B   | 67.12%        |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B   | 68.79%        |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.73B   | 68.82%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE           |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B   | -11.07%       |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B   | -7.67%        |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B   | -6.95%        |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B   | -3.27%        |
| 2023-10-31 | $4.93B   | -4.35%        |

While revenue shows growth and high profit margins, the negative ROE indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity.  The decreasing equity value over recent quarters is also concerning.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins, but it remains unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period reviewed and shows a very negative outlook compared to the market,  despite recent price increases. The high beta signifies considerable volatility.  The provided long-term expected return is extremely negative,  suggesting significant risk for long-term investors unless the company can demonstrate a path to profitability and improved return on equity.  Investors should carefully assess Snowflake's future growth prospects and profitability before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative EPS and ROE, and clarification on data inconsistencies, is crucial.
