The negative expected return and high volatility make it a speculative investment.

**Recommendation:** Investing in Snowflake requires careful consideration of your risk tolerance and investment horizon. Given the negative factors, it may be prudent to wait for greater profitability and a more positive market outlook before considering a long-term investment. Conduct further due diligence, especially regarding the acquisition talks and the specific reasons behind the insider selling.
