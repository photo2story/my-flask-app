## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with negative cumulative returns.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind this underperformance and to assess future potential.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **SNOW Cumulative Return:** -6.86%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 21.81%
* **Return Difference:** -28.67% (SNOW underperformed VOO by 28.67%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 38.2% (This indicates SNOW's performance is significantly below the historical range of its divergence from the S&P 500.)

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals consistently negative alpha values across different periods, suggesting underperformance relative to the market. The high beta values indicate significant market sensitivity.  The considerable size of the company (Cap(B)) should also be considered.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -46.0% | 70.5% | -0.1 | 48.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -33.0% | 70.5% | -0.0 | 66.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -13.0% | 73.9% | -0.0 | 51.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 34.0% | 73.9% | -0.1 | 53.3 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $159.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $159.17
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $146.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $161.29

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, indicating a recent slight downward trend.  However, it's above the 20-day moving average, suggesting potential short-term support. The price is significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a longer-term downward trend. The recent price change (-$0.54) is relatively small and doesn't indicate a significant price swing.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 59.50 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** 1.88 (Positive value indicates a bullish trend.)
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +2.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -63.3% (This is a significant negative expected return, suggesting potential downside risk relative to the S&P 500.  More information on the calculation methodology is needed to interpret this with confidence.)

The relatively small recent price change (-$0.54) doesn't suggest any immediate sharp upward or downward trends.  The long-term expected return of -63.3% relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern and needs further investigation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue      |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98   | $0.94 B      |
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95   | $0.87 B      |
| 2024-05-31 | -$0.95   | $0.83 B      |
| 2023-12-01 | -$0.65   | $0.73 B      |
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65   | $0.73 B      |

There's a discrepancy in the data for November 27th, 2024.  Regardless of the duplication, the consistent negative EPS suggests ongoing losses. Revenue is increasing, but at a slower rate and not offsetting the losses.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $0.99B | 66.23%       |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.94B | 65.94%       |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B | 66.84%       |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.83B | 67.12%       |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B | 68.79%       |

Revenue is steadily increasing, and profit margins remain relatively high.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE      |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 2025-01-31 | $3.00B | -10.92%  |
| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B | -11.07%  |
| 2024-07-31 | $4.13B | -7.67%   |
| 2024-04-30 | $4.56B | -6.95%   |
| 2024-01-31 | $5.18B | -3.27%   |

Despite increasing revenue and high profit margins, the negative ROE across all quarters is a major concern.  This suggests the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity. The significant drop in equity between Q3 and Q4 2024 also needs investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake (SNOW) exhibits a concerning performance profile. While revenue is growing and profit margins are high, persistent negative EPS and ROE highlight fundamental issues.  The stock's significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, as indicated by a large negative alpha and high beta, is a significant red flag. The negative long-term expected return further reinforces the risk.  Before considering any investment, further investigation into the reasons for negative ROE and the methodology behind the -63.3% expected return is crucial. The data suggests high risk and currently does not support a bullish outlook.  A thorough analysis of the company's financial statements and business model is necessary to fully evaluate the investment potential.
