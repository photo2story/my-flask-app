**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently reported negative EPS over the past several quarters, although revenue shows a steady increase. The recent increase in Revenue from ~$0.7B to ~$0.9B is a positive sign, even with persistent losses.  More analysis is required to fully interpret the relationship between Revenue increase and sustained loss.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.98 | $0.94 B     |
| 2024-08-29 | -$0.95 | $0.87 B     |
| 2024-05-31 | -$0.95 | $0.83 B     |
| 2023-12-01 | -$0.65 | $0.73 B     |
| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65 | $0.73 B     |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows strong growth, but the profit margin while impressive is overshadowed by the negative ROE (Return on Equity).  The significant drop in equity from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024 requires further investigation.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31  | $0.99B   | 66.23%        |
| 2024-10-31  | $0.94B   | 65.94%        |
| 2024-07-31  | $0.87B   | 66.84%        |
| 2024-04-30  | $0.83B   | 67.12%        |

| 2025-01-31  | $3.00B   | -10.92%      |
| 2024-10-31  | $2.93B   | -11.07%      |
| 2024-07-31  | $4.13B   | -7.67%       |

| 2024-01-31  | $5.18B   | -3.27%       |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

SNOW is currently exhibiting several concerning factors:  consistently negative EPS, high volatility (indicated by the beta), significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and negative expected long-term returns. While revenue growth is positive, the negative ROE and overall negative returns raise significant concerns about the company's profitability and future prospects.  The provided -73.3% expected return over 2+ years is exceptionally pessimistic and may not accurately reflect future performance.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative EPS and the large drop in equity between Q1 and Q3 2024 is warranted before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The high negative expected return should be treated with extreme skepticism and further due diligence is strongly advised.
