**5. Financial Statements Analysis (Revenue & Profitability and Capital & Profitability):**

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth but continues to operate at a loss.  While recent price action suggests a possible short-term uptrend, the long-term outlook remains uncertain given negative cumulative returns significantly lagging the S&P 500. Technical indicators present a neutral to slightly bullish picture, but the fundamental picture is less positive due to consistent unprofitability.  Further investigation is needed, particularly regarding recent news and analyst sentiment, before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment requires careful consideration of the company's ability to transition to profitability, given its historical performance relative to the market.
