Okay, here's a comprehensive report on Snowflake (SNOW) based on the data provided.

**1. Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **SNOW Company Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing company that provides a platform for data storage, processing, and analytics.
*   **SNOW Cumulative Return:** 51.58%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 54.41%
*   **Divergence:** -12.2 (Relative Divergence: 50.8)
*   **Analysis:** SNOW's cumulative return is slightly lagging behind the S&P 500. The negative divergence (-12.2) indicates underperformance compared to the market benchmark (VOO). The relative divergence of 50.8 suggests the current divergence is in the middle of its historical range, meaning it's neither at its worst nor its best relative performance compared to VOO.

*   **Beta:** The Beta values are close to 0.0 or 0.1, implying that SNOW's price is not strongly correlated with the market, though this could be an artifact of the chosen timeframes.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |

| 2025-09-05 | -0.89 | 1.14 B$       |

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-07-31   | $1.14B     | 67.53%        |
| 2025-04-30   | $1.04B     | 66.53%        |
| 2025-01-31   | $0.99B     | 66.23%        |
| 2024-10-31   | $0.94B     | 65.94%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE        |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| 2025-07-31   | $2.37B     | -12.56%     |
| 2025-04-30   | $2.41B     | -17.86%     |
| 2025-01-31   | $3.00B     | -10.92%     |
| 2024-10-31   | $2.93B     | -11.07%     |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue is growing consistently, and the profit margin is high, suggesting a strong business model. However, the negative ROE (Return on Equity) indicates that the company is not effectively generating profit from its equity. The decrease in Equity over some quarters is also a point to watch.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Mixed Signals:** Snowflake presents a mixed picture. Revenue is growing strongly, and analysts have a generally positive outlook. However, profitability remains a concern (negative EPS and ROE), and the stock has recently underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility & Risk:** The high MDD in the Alpha/Beta analysis underscores the stock's volatility. The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 should be considered. The recent price drop reflected in the 'last market' data and news headlines highlight short-term risk.
*   **Valuation Concerns:** The news mentioning valuation debates (high P/E) should be taken into consideration.
*   **Overall:** Snowflake is a high-growth company with significant potential, but also substantial risk. The recent downturn and profitability concerns warrant caution. The investment recommendation depends on risk tolerance and investment horizon. A strong belief in the long-term potential of cloud data warehousing and Snowflake's market position might justify a buy, but the short-term risks should not be ignored. The 'last market' price change shows a sharp change. The investors should carefully consider such high volatilities.
