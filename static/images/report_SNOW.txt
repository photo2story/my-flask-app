Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Snowflake (SNOW) based on the provided data, structured as requested:

**1. Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing company that provides data storage and analytics services.
*   **SNOW Cumulative Return:** 51.58%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 54.41%
*   **Divergence:** -12.2 (Relative Divergence: 50.8)

**Analysis:** SNOW's cumulative return is slightly below the S&P 500's return over the observed period. The divergence of -12.2 indicates that SNOW has underperformed compared to VOO. A relative divergence of 50.8 suggests the current divergence is near the middle of its historical range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -25.0% | 75.3% | -9.0% | 0.0 | 42.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -25.0% | 78.3% | -27.0% | 0.1 | 58.2 |
| 2022-2024  | -26.0% | 78.3% | -46.0% | 0.1 | 45.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 73.0% | 79.8% | 7.0% | -0.0 | 77.5 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows significant negative growth in the earlier periods but a substantial positive turnaround in the most recent period (2023-2025). This indicates high volatility in SNOW's performance.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and price declines at some point during each period.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are mostly negative, suggesting SNOW underperformed relative to its benchmark in the earlier periods. The positive Alpha in the 2023-2025 period indicates outperformance.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are close to zero, suggesting SNOW's price is not strongly correlated with the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** This likely refers to Market Capitalization in Billions. Fluctuations here reflect investor sentiment and overall market conditions.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 265.11
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 228.95, Previous Close: 234.77, Change: -2.48
*   **5-day SMA:** 257.12
*   **20-day SMA:** 256.64
*   **60-day SMA:** 246.01

**Analysis:** The stock price experienced a sharp decline on the last market day, as reflected in the significant negative change. The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are both near each other, indicating a relatively stable trend in the short term. However, since these SMAs are above the 60-day SMA, there is a potential indication of recent upward momentum, despite the most recent drop. The sharp decline on the last day might indicate a possible reversal of that trend.

*   **RSI:** 46.90
*   **PPO:** 0.1879

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests moderate risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 46.9 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.

*   **Market Sentiment:** Recent news suggests short-term negative sentiment due to a price drop, but analyst consensus remains positive with a "Buy" rating.
*   **Risk:** The high MDD and negative expected return indicate significant risk. The Beta is close to zero, which means the price isn't strongly correlated with the market.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Technical indicators are mixed, with a neutral RSI and a slightly positive PPO, but a negative recent relative divergence change.
*   **Divergence from S&P500** It lags slightly behind S&P500, but not meaningfully.

However, it's also a risky investment due to its lack of profitability and high volatility. The recent price drop and negative short-term divergence change warrant caution. Investors should weigh the potential upside against the considerable risks before investing. The mixed analyst opinions and news headlines suggest that the stock's future is uncertain. Further monitoring of earnings and market sentiment is advised.
