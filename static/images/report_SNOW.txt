**7. 종합적 분석 (Overall Summary)**

*   **Mixed Signals:** SNOW presents a mixed investment picture. There's strong revenue growth and high profit margins, and recent news suggests potentially strong Q3 results. However, the company is currently unprofitable (negative EPS and ROE), and it has underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Technical Weakness:** Recent price action and technical indicators (price below moving averages, oversold RSI, negative PPO) suggest short-term bearish momentum.
*   **Long-Term Concerns:** The negative expected return indicates that, based on current data, long-term investments are projected to underperform the market.
*   **Risk:** The high MDD indicates significant risk.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analyst consensus is generally positive ("Buy" rating with a mean of 1.60), and the average target price ($271.76) is significantly higher than the current price. However, analysts can be wrong, and it is better to consider multiple objective indicators instead of the subjective impressions of a few analysts.

**Conclusion:**

SNOW is a high-growth but currently unprofitable company. The positive revenue growth and analyst sentiment are encouraging, but investors should be aware of the significant risks and underperformance relative to the broader market. Based on the data, caution is warranted. Investors should closely monitor the company's path to profitability and assess whether its growth trajectory justifies the current valuation. Given the recent price decline, and oversold conditions, a small position *might* be considered by investors with a high-risk tolerance and long-term horizon, but a larger investment is not recommended at this time.
