*   **Future Outlook:** Analysts are generally optimistic about SNOW's future, particularly regarding its AI capabilities.

**Overall Recommendation:**

SNOW presents a mixed picture. While there are clear signs of positive momentum and strong revenue growth, the negative earnings and ROE are concerning.

Given the high MRI and positive short-term indicators, a **cautiously optimistic approach** may be warranted. However, investors should be aware of the risks associated with the company's current financial performance and the potential for continued underperformance relative to the S&P 500. A long-term perspective is necessary, and continuous monitoring of earnings and market trends is crucial.
