## Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Stock Review

This report analyzes Snowflake Inc. (SNOW), a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Snowflake's cumulative return of -31.96% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's 75.07% return over the measured period.  The difference is a substantial -107.03%, placing it at the 4.51 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided CAGR figures further highlight this underperformance across various periods, ranging from -28.5% to -61.1%. High Beta values (43.7-66.7) suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values (57.1%-62.3%) indicate significant potential for substantial losses. Alpha values above 1.9 suggest that while the stock underperformed the market, it did better than the expected return based on its beta.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $129.12
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $128.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $121.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $116.75

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates a potential consolidation or slight weakening of the recent upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (70.5):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a near-term pullback.
* **PPO (0.68):** Positive, indicating upward momentum.  
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (3.85+):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend.

The provided expected return of 0.0% for long-term (2+ years) investment suggests that, at the current valuation, there's no significant projected excess return over the S&P 500. Given the current price of $129.14 being slightly above the recent high, there's a slight risk of a short-term correction. However, no indication of a dramatic 급반등 (sharp rebound) or 급하락 (sharp decline) is explicitly present in the data.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financials show consistent negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses. While revenue is growing, the company is not yet profitable.  The latest earnings (-$0.95 EPS) missed analyst expectations (the report doesn't provide the expected EPS for comparison).  Profit margins are healthy but profitability needs to improve. Consistent negative EPS and a lack of profitability need to be considered major risk factors.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data shows a high profit margin (66.84%-68.82%), indicating efficient operations. However, ROE remains consistently negative (-3.27% to -7.67%), highlighting the company's struggle to generate returns on equity despite high margins.  This suggests potential concerns about capital efficiency and profitability despite strong revenue growth.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires access to recent news sources like Shacknews and Finbold to provide a comprehensive analysis of recent earnings news, analyst opinions, and market outlook. Please provide links to relevant news articles for a more complete analysis.)*  Without access to real-time news, I cannot offer specific insights.  However, the consistent negative EPS and underperformance compared to the S&P 500 should raise caution regarding recent news and market sentiment.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake exhibits strong revenue growth and high profit margins. However, consistent negative EPS and ROE, along with significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, raise concerns about the company's long-term profitability and value.  The high Beta indicates significant volatility, making it a riskier investment. Although some positive indicators are present (positive PPO and recent price movements above moving averages), the significant underperformance and lack of profitability should make investors cautious.  Further investigation into recent news, including analyst opinions and market outlook, is highly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The expected 0.0% long-term excess return over the S&P 500 further tempers any enthusiasm about long-term, significant outperformance.
