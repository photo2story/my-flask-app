**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is a "Buy," with a significant upside potential based on the average target price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices ($170-$500) indicates a lack of certainty among analysts. The absence of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the current analyst sentiment trend.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Snowflake exhibits a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:**  Underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative EPS and ROE, declining equity, high MDD, recent short-term decline, director share sales, and competition from Databricks. The negative expected return also casts a shadow on long-term investment potential.

**Overall Assessment:**

Investing in SNOW is risky. While the company shows promise in revenue growth and high profit margins, its lack of profitability, declining equity, and underperformance compared to the market are significant concerns. The mixed news flow and wide analyst target price range add to the uncertainty. The negative expected return is a red flag. A higher risk tolerance is needed to buy Snowflake stock.
