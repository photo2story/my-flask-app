**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO (-0.54):** Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** A recent increase of 5.5 suggests a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (-57.3%):** The significantly negative expected return indicates a potential for substantial losses, especially considering the current price decrease of -3.82  This significant negative return should be investigated further and likely needs justification or further data.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake shows strong revenue growth but persistent unprofitability and significant negative returns relative to the market.  The high beta suggests substantial volatility.  While the recent price drop might create a technically oversold condition, the negative expected return and overall bearish trend raise concerns.  The substantial drop in Equity also requires further analysis.  A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) might be considered only after a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the negative expected return and a more detailed analysis of the financial statements.  Further investigation is needed to determine if the current price reflects the company's long-term potential.
