**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, showing substantial negative returns. While revenue is growing, the company remains unprofitable, indicated by consistent negative EPS and ROE. The high beta suggests significant volatility. Technical indicators show a slightly positive short-term trend, but the extremely negative projected long-term return and persistently negative earnings raise serious concerns.  The current valuation appears to be significantly overvalued based on the current financial performance and extremely negative long-term projected return.  A long-term investment in SNOW at this time presents substantial risk.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative projected return is strongly recommended before considering any investment.
