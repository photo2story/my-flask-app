**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출    |
|------------|-------|---------|

The 2025-12-05 data shows 1.21B$ in revenue and a -0.87 EPS. This large revenue with a large loss is something to be concerned about, and investors should review how the company is reinvesting capital.

| 2024-10-31 | $2.93B  | -11.07% |

**Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Snowflake's revenue is consistently increasing. The profit margin is very high, implying that the company has good production and process management to retain over two-thirds of its revenue.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has fluctuated, decreasing more recently. The Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating profits from shareholder equity. This is consistent with the negative EPS reports.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

Snowflake presents a mixed picture.

**Negatives:**

*   **Underperformance:** SNOW has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Downtrend:** The stock is trading below its key SMAs, indicating a downtrend.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** Models predict a negative return compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Negative News:** Recent news focuses on stock price declines and underwhelming outlook.
*   **Negative EPS & ROE:**  The company consistently reports negative EPS and ROE, indicating a lack of profitability.

**Positives:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** The analyst consensus remains a "Buy," with a significant upside potential.
*   **High Revenue and Gross Profit:** The company has continued to increase their revenue and hold a high profit margin.
*   **RSI Nearing Oversold:**  The RSI suggests a potential for a rebound.
*   **MRI Suggests Medium Risk:** Indicates there is still an opportunity to take some risks to see gains.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Investing in Snowflake at this current juncture carries a significant amount of risk. While analysts remain optimistic and the revenue growth is encouraging, the lack of profitability, negative market sentiment, and negative expected return are major red flags. It is imperative to follow all market actions, because the stock might be oversold and has a possibility to rebound with high revenues and gross profits. An investment at this point would be considered a high-risk, high-reward scenario. Investors should carefully weigh the potential upside against the considerable downside risks and conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions.
