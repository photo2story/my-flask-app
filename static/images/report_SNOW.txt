| 2024-11-27 | -$0.65  | $0.73B       |

The data shows consistent negative EPS over the reported period with a slight decrease in revenue during the reported quarters. Further investigation is required to understand the reasons behind the negative profitability.  There seems to be a data duplication for Nov 27th, 2024.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $0.99B     | 66.23%        |

| 2024-01-31 | $0.77B     | 68.79%        |

Revenue shows a steady growth trend. Profit margins remain high and relatively stable, despite negative EPS reported earlier.  This discrepancy needs further investigation.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2025-01-31 | $3.00      | -10.92   |

Equity fluctuates, and ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity. This is concerning and warrants a deeper dive into the company's financial statements.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake (SNOW) shows mixed signals.  While revenue is growing and profit margins are high, the company is experiencing negative EPS and ROE.  The stock significantly underperforms the S&P 500, with a high beta indicating substantial market sensitivity. Technical indicators suggest some short-term bullish momentum, but the negative expected return and high relative deviation warrant caution.  A thorough review of the company's financial statements, future growth projections, and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions. The negative EPS and ROE despite high profit margins strongly suggest a need for further financial analysis to reconcile this discrepancy.  The provided -61.9% expected return requires substantial clarification regarding its calculation.  The data suggests the need for a more in-depth analysis to fully understand SNOW's performance and future prospects.
