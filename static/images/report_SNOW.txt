I'll start with the raw numbers, then add simple analysis and context for each section. Finally, I'll summarize the overall picture.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** SNOW (Snowflake Inc.)
*   **Overview:** Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing company that provides data storage and analytics services.
*   **SNOW Cumulative Return:** 26.17%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 52.94%

The relative divergence of 36.1% suggests that the current divergence is not at its worst historically, but is still closer to the lower end of its past fluctuation range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -25.0%  | 75.3% | -9.0%   | 0.0    | 49.1   |
| 2021-2023  | -25.0%  | 78.3% | -27.0%  | 0.1    | 68.1   |

| 2023-2025  | 47.0%   | 79.8% | -17.0%  | -0.0   | 75.5   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows inconsistent performance. Periods of significant negative CAGR are followed by a positive CAGR.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Consistently high drawdowns indicate significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Significantly negative alpha values suggest underperformance relative to a benchmark, indicating the stock hasn't been generating excess returns.
*   **Beta:** Beta near zero means that there is little coorelation between SNOW and the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):**  Shows changes in the company's market value over different periods.

**Analysis:** This table highlights Snowflake's volatile nature and historical underperformance relative to market benchmarks. The large drawdowns are a key risk factor. The recent return from 2023-2025 is encouraging, but needs to be seen in the context of previous declines.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 220.60
*   **Last Market Change:** Price: 220.6, Previous Close: 215.28, Change: 2.47
*   **5-day SMA:** 218.17
*   **20-day SMA:** 238.33
*   **60-day SMA:** 245.83

**Analysis:**  The stock price is below both its 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a recent downtrend.  The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, reinforcing this short-term bearish signal. The price increase compared to the previous close (2.47) is a short-term positive sign, but needs to be considered in the context of the overall trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 32.09
*   **PPO:** -1.27
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 90% of cash (4 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** 0.1 (+): Short-term increase.
*   **Expected Return:** -39.8%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests a moderate risk environment for investment.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 32.09 indicates the stock is nearing oversold conditions, suggesting a potential for a price rebound.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal advises buying with 90% of available cash, but frames it as a "safe" move given the MRI, suggesting cautious optimism.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The short-term increase in relative divergence could signal some momentum.
*   **Expected Return:** The -39.8% expected return is very concerning, signaling a significant potential for loss if held long-term.
