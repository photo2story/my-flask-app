*   **Profitability Concerns:**  However, the company is not currently profitable (negative EPS and ROE), and historical performance has lagged the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:**  The stock is volatile, as indicated by the high MDD figures.
*   **Short-Term Uncertainty:**  Recent news about AI stocks facing turbulence and the short-term bearish PPO signal add to the uncertainty.
*   **Long-Term Underperformance Expectation:** The negative expected return suggests potential long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**Investment Recommendation:**

Given the high volatility, lack of current profitability, and the mixed signals from technical indicators and recent news, a cautious approach is warranted. While analyst sentiment is generally positive and revenue growth is encouraging, the risks associated with SNOW are significant. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing.  The negative expected return suggests that other investment options may provide better risk-adjusted returns over the long term.
