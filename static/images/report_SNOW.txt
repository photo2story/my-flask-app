Snowflake Inc. is a cloud-based data warehousing and analytics company.  As of the last data point, SNOW's cumulative return is -8.58%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 78.24%. This represents a significant underperformance of -86.8 percentage points.  The relative underperformance compared to the historical range is 17.1%, indicating it's not at an extreme low point historically, but still substantially lagging the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $135.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $121.66

The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The significant difference between the current price and the 20 and 60-day moving averages indicates a sharp recent increase.

* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +15.2% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0%  (This implies no expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term based on the current data.  This requires further analysis to validate)
* **Price Note:** The current price of $173.7, significantly above the moving averages, suggests a recent sharp price increase (rapid rebound).  This needs careful consideration; it could indicate strong buying pressure or a temporary surge preceding a potential correction.

* **EPS Trend:** Consistently negative, with no significant improvements.
* **Significant Changes:** While the magnitude of the negative EPS remains relatively consistent, it shows no significant improvement and remains a serious concern.  No comparisons to expectations are available within this data set.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Snowflake (SNOW) is currently showing a sharp price increase after a period of significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, this increase is occurring against the backdrop of consistently negative EPS, slightly declining profit margins, and a generally negative ROE.  Technical indicators such as the high RSI suggest the stock might be overbought and susceptible to a correction.  The lack of positive analyst sentiment or news within the last two days further cautions against optimism.  Long-term investors should carefully consider the company's financial health and consistent underperformance before making any investment decisions.  The 0% expected return, based on available data, indicates that, at present, there is no expectation of outperforming the S&P 500.  Further investigation into analyst sentiment, future expectations, and catalyst events is necessary for a more complete assessment.
