*   **Negatives:** Underperformance compared to the S&P 500, high volatility (MDD), negative EPS, negative ROE, decreasing equity, negative expected returns, and some recent news about institutional selling.
*   **Overall:** Snowflake appears to be a high-growth, high-risk investment. The company is growing revenue rapidly, but is not yet profitable. The recent stock price decline and negative investor sentiment suggest caution is warranted.
