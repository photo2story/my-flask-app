**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (RXRX) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging artificial intelligence and automation to discover and develop new drugs.  RXRX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return of -59.53% compared to VOO's 20.72%.  This represents a substantial -80.2% difference, placing it at the 5.1 percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals consistently negative alpha values across the given periods (2021-2023, 2022-2024, 2023-2025), indicating consistent underperformance relative to the market.  The high and fluctuating beta values (3.8, 2.6, 2.0) suggest high volatility and significant sensitivity to market movements.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RXRX exhibits extremely poor performance relative to the S&P 500, reflected in significantly negative cumulative returns and alpha.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, while financial statements reveal consistent losses and negative profitability.  The extremely negative projected return (-444.5%) requires further explanation of the methodology used.  Given the substantial underperformance, high volatility, and ongoing losses,  RXRX presents significant risk for investors.  Further due diligence, including a thorough analysis of the company's pipeline, research and development progress, and management strategy is crucial before considering any investment. The data inconsistencies and unusual financial figures necessitate further investigation to determine accuracy.
