**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2025-05-05 | -$0.5 | $0.01 B        |

The company is consistently reporting negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  Revenue is low and inconsistent, showing no clear signs of substantial growth.  The slight increase in revenue in November 2024 is not enough to offset the persistent losses.


**5) Financial Information:**

No "Total Revenue" or "Gross Profit" data is available.  This lack of crucial financial information severely limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  It highlights a potential lack of transparency or data reporting issues.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

RXRX exhibits significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, marked by negative cumulative returns, negative alpha, high beta, and consistently negative EPS. While some technical indicators suggest potential stabilization or even slightly positive momentum, the company's financial data is severely lacking.  The projected significantly negative expected return of -565.3% relative to S&P 500 over the long term suggests considerable risk.  Before considering any investment, it is crucial to obtain complete financial information and conduct thorough due diligence, given the high risk profile and currently available data. The lack of crucial financial data further complicates any investment decision.  The current situation strongly advises against investment unless significant positive changes are observed in future reports.
