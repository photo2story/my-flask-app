* **Cumulative Return (RXRX):** -52.70%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 4.60%

**1) Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently negative alpha and high beta values across the analyzed periods (2021-2025).  This suggests RXRX significantly underperformed the market (negative alpha) and exhibits high volatility (high beta, especially the 3.8 in 2021-2023).  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) of 73.6% further emphasizes the substantial risk associated with this investment.  The decreasing beta across years indicates possibly decreasing volatility over time, but this is only based on a limited dataset.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $7.06

The price is significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price drop of -4.88% from the previous close reflects a negative short-term trend.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.49 (High Risk)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.7% (Short-term upward movement in relative performance, but still significantly below VOO)
* **Expected Return:** -223.0% (This extremely negative expected return highlights significant downside risk.  The projection is likely based on the current negative trend and volatility.)

The significant price drop (-4.88%) warrants attention and suggests the potential for further downward pressure.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

RXRX shows extremely poor performance relative to the S&P 500, with consistent negative returns and high volatility.  Technical indicators point towards a bearish trend, supported by the price movement below all moving averages and an oversold RSI.  Financial data reveals persistent losses and inconsistent revenue growth.  The negative expected return and high risk profile (MRI) make a long-term investment in RXRX exceptionally risky.  Unless there are significant improvements in the company's financials and operational performance, investors should exercise extreme caution. The data quality issues further raise concerns.  Before considering any investment, thorough due diligence and a reassessment of the company's long-term prospects are absolutely necessary.
