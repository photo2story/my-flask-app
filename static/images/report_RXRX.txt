**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **RXRX Cumulative Return:** -48.95%

The table below shows the alpha and beta analysis, illustrating RXRX's underperformance relative to the market (represented by the negative alpha) and high volatility (high beta).  The company's consistently negative alpha across the periods suggests it has not generated returns in excess of the market.  The high beta value indicates significant price fluctuations that correlate with overall market movements.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 5.0% | 73.6% | -12.0% | 4.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 0.0% | 73.6% | -22.0% | 2.7 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $5.58
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $5.49
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $5.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $6.75

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price decrease of $0.05 from the previous close (-0.89%) is relatively small and doesn't indicate a significant drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 53.13 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 2.68 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -318.3% (This extremely negative figure suggests a significantly lower expected return than the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This requires further investigation and context to validate.)

The relatively low RSI and the negative relative divergence suggest a recent downtrend. However, the positive PPO indicates some potential for upward momentum. The extremely negative expected return of -318.3% is highly concerning and warrants careful scrutiny. This value is likely an outlier and likely needs deeper contextual analysis to understand its validity.  A negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is possible given the company's performance to date.


**Overall:** RXRX shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, high volatility, and a mixed technical picture.  The extremely negative expected return requires further investigation and should not be taken at face value without understanding its calculation methodology and assumptions.  Investors should carefully consider the inherent risks before investing in RXRX.
