*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 43.91%
*   **Divergence:** -69.6 (Relative Divergence: 2.7)

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 22.0% | 81.0% | 26.0% | -0.2 | 5.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 11.0% | 81.0% | -10.0% | 0.1 | 3.5 |
| 2023-2025  | 17.0% | 80.0% | -50.0% | 0.1 | 2.4 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Shows inconsistent growth, fluctuating between 11% and 22%.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (around 80%) indicates significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha has decreased significantly over time, from a positive 26% to a negative -50%. This indicates a decreasing ability to outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Beta near 0.1 indicates low correlation with market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has decreased from 5.1 billion to 2.4 billion, indicating value losses.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 4.63
*   **Previous Close:** 4.41
*   **Change:** 4.99%
*   **5-day SMA:** 4.38
*   **20-day SMA:** 4.53
*   **60-day SMA:** 5.08

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently showing an upward trend with a 4.99% change.  The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are below the 60-day SMA, which might suggest a potential short-term upward trend, but longer-term trend may still be downwards.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.25 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.78 (Potentially Bullish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (226 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.7 (+) 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -180.3%

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, which seems contradictory given the underperformance. RSI at 50 is neutral. The PPO being positive suggests bullish momentum. The hybrid signal advocates for a full investment, likely due to the MRI score. The recent increase in relative divergence points to a short-term upward trend. **The most concerning aspect is the very low expected return of -180.3%, which indicates a pessimistic long-term outlook.**

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed News:** The news articles present a mixed picture.
    *   Some articles focus on Q3 earnings misses and losses.
    *   One suggests alternative AI stocks.
    *   Others discuss potential strategic shifts and partnerships.
    *   One article discusses RXRX stock fell 17% this week.

**Analysis:** The news flow is concerning. The focus on losses, earnings misses, and suggestions of better AI investment options creates a negative sentiment around the stock. The discussion about a potential shift in strategy could indicate uncertainty about the company's future direction.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:**  No clear consensus is available.
*   **Target Price:** The average target price of $6.33 is above the current price ($4.63). However, the range is wide ($3.00 - $10.00), indicating uncertainty among analysts.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent rating changes were provided.

**Analysis:** The analyst opinions are mixed. While the average target price is higher than the current price, the wide range suggests a lack of strong conviction. The missing rating changes also make it difficult to assess recent sentiment.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Overall, the data presents a concerning picture for Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX).

*   **Underperformance:**  It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Volatile Financials:**  Revenue is inconsistent, and profitability is poor, with consistently negative profit margins, EPS, and ROE.
*   **Negative Sentiment:** Recent news and analyst opinions, while mixed, lean toward caution due to earnings misses and strategic uncertainty.
*   **High Risk:** The high Maximum Drawdown and a very low expected return further highlight the risk associated with this stock.
*   **Contradictory Indicators:** The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests a high investment recommendation, which seems misaligned with the negative financial performance and market sentiment. This could be due to the MRI's specific calculation methodology or a reliance on factors not captured in the other data.

**Conclusion:** While there might be short-term upward potential based on recent price movements and certain technical indicators (PPO, short-term divergence), the long-term outlook appears highly uncertain and risky. The company needs to demonstrate a clear path to profitability and address investor concerns regarding its strategy to improve its market performance. The significantly negative expected return should be a major red flag for potential investors.
