*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 22.0% | 81.0% | 26.0% | -0.2 | 5.3 |

| 2023-2025  | 11.0% | 80.0% | -54.0% | 0.1 | 2.3 |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has decreased over the periods, from 22% (2021-2023) to 11% (2022-2024 and 2023-2025).
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) remains consistently high around 80-81%, indicating significant risk and volatility in the stock's performance.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha has decreased significantly, moving from a positive 26% (2021-2023) to a negative -54% (2023-2025). This suggests that the stock's performance, relative to its benchmark, has deteriorated.
    *   **Beta:** Beta remains low, fluctuating around -0.2 to 0.1. A low beta suggests the stock is less correlated with the overall market.
    *   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has decreased from $5.3 billion to $2.3 billion, which could indicate decreased investor confidence or poor stock performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **5-day SMA:** 4.356
*   **20-day SMA:** 4.4978
*   **60-day SMA:** 5.0218

*   **Analysis:** The stock price shows a recent increase in the last market data, with a 3.29% change. However, the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are significantly below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a possible short-term upward trend but a longer-term downward trend. The large change in the last market data ('price': 4.4, 'previousClose': 4.26, 'change': 3.29) indicates a potential fluctuation issue, suggesting a sharp rebound.

    *   The negative change in relative divergence (-0.5) suggests a short-term decline in performance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   The significantly negative Expected Return (-552.1%) is a very concerning indicator, suggesting that, based on current data and models, a long-term investment in RXRX is projected to drastically underperform the S&P 500.

    *   The lack of recent rating changes information limits further analysis.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

RXRX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. While recent news and analyst sentiment suggest some positive catalysts (JPMorgan upgrade, trial data), the underlying financials paint a concerning picture. The company consistently reports negative EPS, negative profit margins (except for a one-time outlier), and negative ROE. The expected return is highly negative, indicating a potentially very poor long-term investment.

**Conclusion:** While there are potential short-term upside catalysts based on news and analyst opinions, the fundamental financial data suggests a high-risk investment. The long-term outlook, based on current data and models, is pessimistic. Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before investing in RXRX. Close monitoring of financial performance and clinical trial results is critical.
