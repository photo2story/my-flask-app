    *   **Beta:** A measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the market. A beta around 0.1 suggests that RXRX is less sensitive to market movements than the overall market (VOO has Beta of 1).
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization in Billions.  The company's market cap has decreased over these periods, which is consistent with the negative returns and underperformance.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment).  This suggests a moderate level of risk from a model that considers a range of factors.
*   **RSI:** 46.19.  An RSI around 50 is considered neutral, neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** 0.0634. PPO is Percent Price Oscillator, which is a momentum oscillator and it can be used to identify potential overbought and oversold conditions, divergence, and centerline crossovers
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (225 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.7% of total investment ($1,000.00)." This is a model-driven recommendation suggesting a full buy-in based on the "Very Safe" rating and a high MRI score (0.9) *at the time this signal was generated*.  It suggests investing a fixed dollar amount monthly.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (negative), indicating a short-term decline relative to the comparison stock (VOO).
*   **Expected Return:** -552.1%.  This is an extremely negative expected return, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. This indicates a high degree of risk and uncertainty in the future performance of the stock from its current price.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Underperformance:** RXRX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The high negative expected return suggests that this trend is expected to continue, at least in the short-term.
*   **Volatility and Risk:** The stock exhibits high volatility and risk as reflected by its MDD, beta, and recent price fluctuations.
*   **Financial Weakness:** The company has negative EPS, inconsistent revenue, mostly negative profit margins, and negative ROE. This suggests the company is struggling to generate profits.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Analyst opinions are mixed. The consensus is "Buy," but the target price range is wide. The recent JP Morgan upgrade is a positive, but it contrasts with the poor financial performance and negative outlook.
*   **Conclusion:** RXRX is a high-risk investment. While there are potential catalysts for growth (like successful clinical trials and AI drug discovery), the company's current financial performance is weak, and the stock is volatile. Investment in RXRX should be approached with caution and a strong understanding of the associated risks. The model's buy signal should be carefully considered in light of the overall negative indicators. Given the negative expected return, negative divergence with the S&P500, and consistent negative financial results, a strong contrarian argument needs to be presented to justify an investment at this time.
