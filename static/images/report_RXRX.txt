**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 17.42 and negative PPO (-2.87) confirm the oversold and bearish sentiment. The high Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.6333 points to high risk.  The recent positive change in relative divergence (+15.9) suggests a short-term upward trend, but this needs to be considered in the context of the longer-term negative trend. The expected return of -64.9% is extremely negative, implying substantial losses compared to the S&P 500 even with a long-term investment horizon of 2 years or more.  Given the significant recent price drop, this needs further investigation.
