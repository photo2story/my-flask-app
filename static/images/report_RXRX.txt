## Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RXRX) Stock Report

**0) Numerical Overview and Initial Analysis:**

RXRX, Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc., is a biotechnology company focused on applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to drug discovery.

The provided data shows RXRX significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While VOO had a cumulative return of 11.84%, RXRX experienced a cumulative loss of -51.54%. This represents a substantial divergence.  The relative divergence of -63.4% indicates RXRX's performance is considerably below the historical range of its performance relative to the S&P 500.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

| Metric                    | RXRX       | VOO        | Difference |
|---------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Cumulative Return (%)      | -51.54%     | 11.84%      | -63.38%     |
| Relative Divergence (%)    | -63.4%    | N/A        | N/A        |


The Alpha and Beta analysis suggests that RXRX's returns are highly sensitive to market movements (high Beta) while consistently underperforming the market (negative Alpha).  The shrinking market capitalization is also concerning.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $4.65
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $4.37
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $5.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $6.97

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent 17.13% price increase from the previous close suggests a potential short-term bounce but remains within a bearish trend given the moving averages.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.53 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 28.21 (Oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -2.76 (Bearish signal)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +3.3 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -445.7% (This extremely negative expected return highlights the significant risk associated with RXRX.  It's crucial to remember that this is a forecast, and actual results may vary significantly.)


The combination of high risk (MRI), oversold conditions (RSI), and a negative PPO suggests a bearish outlook, albeit with a recent short-term price increase. The extremely negative expected return emphasizes significant investment risk.

Investing in RXRX carries substantial risk and is only suitable for highly aggressive investors with a high tolerance for losses.  Thorough due diligence and a long-term perspective (if even considered) are absolutely crucial before any investment decision.
