*   **Uncertain Outlook:** The extremely negative expected return indicates significant headwinds in the long term.

**Recommendation:** Given the financial challenges and high volatility, a cautious approach is warranted.

The Hybrid Signal suggesting caution due to MRI supports a safe investment approach.
