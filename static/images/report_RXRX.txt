## Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RXRX) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

RXRX, Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc., is a biotechnology company focused on applying artificial intelligence to drug discovery.  The company shows significantly underperformed compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.


**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **RXRX Cumulative Return:** -46.88%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 19.97%
* **Return Difference:** -66.9%
* **Relative Divergence:** 6.1% (This means the current underperformance of RXRX relative to VOO is at the 6.1st percentile of its historical range of underperformance, suggesting that its current underperformance is relatively mild compared to its historical lows.)

The provided CAGR data shows consistently low or zero growth, highlighting substantial underperformance against the market benchmark (VOO).  High negative Alpha values across the periods indicate significant underperformance compared to the market.  The high Beta (2.3-4.0) suggests high volatility, meaning RXRX's price is more sensitive to market fluctuations than the overall market.  Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) consistently above 70% indicate substantial periods of significant losses.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $5.70
* **5-day Moving Average:** $5.67
* **20-day Moving Average:** $5.29
* **60-day Moving Average:** $6.55

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates a recent price consolidation phase, although the price is trending downwards when considering the 60-day average.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 48.56 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.62 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.3% (Short-term bearish)
* **Expected Return:** -565.3% (This extremely negative figure suggests a significant projected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.  This should be interpreted cautiously.)

The conflicting signals from the indicators (positive PPO but negative relative divergence and extremely negative expected return) suggest uncertainty about the near-term direction, but lean towards bearish. The extremely negative expected return warrants serious caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |

Consistent negative EPS and low revenue figures indicate ongoing financial challenges.  Revenue shows some variability, but overall remains low.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  Further financial data is required for a complete assessment.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) demonstrates considerable underperformance against the S&P 500, marked by consistently negative returns, high volatility, and substantial drawdowns.  While some technical indicators hint at potential bullish momentum, the overwhelmingly negative expected return, persistent negative earnings, low revenue, and missing key financial data paint a concerning picture. The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  Given the current data, investing in RXRX carries substantial risk and a very high degree of uncertainty regarding future performance.  A more in-depth analysis with complete financial statements and a better understanding of the company's long-term strategic plans is necessary before forming any investment decision.
