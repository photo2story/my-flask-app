2025-12-28 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) based on the data provided.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Recursion Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to discover, develop, and commercialize novel therapeutics.
*   **Return Comparison:**
    *   RXRX Cumulative Return: -31.19%
    *   VOO Cumulative Return: 45.19%
    *   Divergence: -73.9 (Relative Divergence: 0.3)
*   **Analysis:** RXRX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The negative divergence of -73.9 indicates a substantial difference in returns, and the relative divergence of 0.3 suggests the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range. This underperformance needs further investigation.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|-----------|---------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2021-2023 | 22.0%   | 81.0%  | 26.0%   | -0.2   | 5.1    |
| 2022-2024 | 11.0%   | 81.0%  | -10.0%  | 0.1    | 3.5    |
| 2023-2025 | 11.0%   | 80.0%  | -56.0%  | 0.1    | 2.2    |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has decreased over the periods, indicating slowing growth.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high (around 80%), showing significant volatility and potential for large losses.
    *   **Alpha:**  Alpha has declined sharply, becoming significantly negative in the most recent period. This means RXRX is underperforming relative to its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) and is not generating excess returns based on its risk profile.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is low (close to zero), suggesting RXRX's price movements are not strongly correlated with the broader market.  This *could* be seen as a positive in a market downturn, but in this case, it seems to be contributing to the underperformance.
    *   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has decreased each year.
**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** $4.25
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: $4.25, Previous Close: $4.40, Change: -3.41%
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: $4.334
    *   20-day SMA: $4.5043
    *   60-day SMA: $4.9864

*   **Analysis:** The stock is trading below all three moving averages, which is generally a bearish signal.  The recent price decrease (-3.41%) confirms downward momentum.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) -  This is a surprising signal given the other data.  An MRI of 1.0 suggests a high level of confidence, which seems contradictory to the stock's performance.
*   **RSI:** 38.5 -  This indicates that the stock is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* suggest a potential for a rebound, but it's not a guarantee.
*   **PPO:** -0.0178 - The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is negative, indicating a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (225 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.7% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01) - This is a strong BUY signal, with 100% cash invested in the stock. This signal is classified as very safe and recommends a monthly investment.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -0.5 (short-term decline) - Confirms the recent negative price action.
*   **Expected Return:** -552.1% - This is an extremely negative expected return, indicating significant risk and potential for further losses compared to the S&P 500. This should raise a red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive:**
    *   Cathie Wood (ARK Invest) is increasing her position in RXRX.
    *   Analysts are refocusing on REC-4881 data.
    *   J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock.
    *   Mentions of AI potential.
*   **Other:**
    *   Discussion of a 2026 CEO transition.

*   **Analysis:** Recent news is a mixed bag. Cathie Wood's increased investment and the J.P. Morgan upgrade provide positive signals. The analyst focus on REC-4881 (likely a specific drug candidate) is also potentially positive. However, the CEO transition adds an element of uncertainty. It's important to understand *why* J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock and the specific details of the REC-4881 data. The AI angle is a common theme with Recursion, but the company needs to demonstrate how its AI platform translates to tangible results.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 2.50)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: $7.00, High: $11.00, Low: $3.00
*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting a neutral outlook.  The average target price of $7.00 is significantly higher than the current price of $4.25, implying potential upside. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices ($3.00 - $11.00) indicates considerable uncertainty among analysts.  The lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the latest sentiment.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출      |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2025-11-05 | -0.36  | 0.01 B$   |
| 2025-08-05 | -0.41  | 0.02 B$   |
| 2025-05-05 | -0.5   | 0.01 B$   |
| 2024-11-06 | -0.34  | 0.03 B$   |
| 2025-11-05 | -0.34  | 0.03 B$   |

*   **Analysis:** Recursion is consistently losing money. Earnings per share (EPS) is negative and revenue generation is limited. While there are fluctuations in both, the overall trend points to ongoing losses. The most recent data is identical, implying the table may have a duplicate entry.

**6) Financial Information (Quarterly)**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.00B   | -194.74%      |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.02B   | -5.54%       |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.01B   | -47.31%      |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.00B   | -183.62%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.03B   | 53.69%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE       |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $1.05B   | -15.50%   |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.92B   | -18.70%   |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.93B   | -21.68%   |
| 2024-12-31 | $1.03B   | -17.29%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.52B   | -18.27%   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue:** Revenue is volatile and generally low. The periods with zero revenue are concerning.
    *   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are consistently negative, often significantly so. The one positive margin in 2024-09-30 is an outlier and warrants further investigation to understand its cause.
    *   **Equity:** Equity is relatively stable, suggesting the company is not rapidly burning through cash, but there is a recent decrease.
    *   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating profits from its shareholders' investments.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.

*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   High Maximum Drawdown, indicating substantial volatility.
    *   Negative and declining Alpha, indicating underperformance relative to its risk.
    *   Stock price below moving averages, signaling a downtrend.
    *   Extremely negative expected return.
    *   Consistent losses (negative EPS) and low revenue.
    *   Negative profit margins and ROE.
*   **Positive/Neutral Factors:**
    *   Cathie Wood's continued investment (though she may have a different risk tolerance).
    *   Analyst focus on REC-4881.
    *   J.P. Morgan upgrade (need to understand the reasoning).
    *   Potential for a short-term rebound based on RSI being near oversold.
    *   The MRI value of 1.0 is HIGHLY suspect given all the other negative data.
    *   Analyst "Hold" consensus with a higher average target price (but wide range).
    *   "Very Safe" BUY signal from Hybrid signal analysis system.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this data, investing in RXRX is highly speculative. The company's financials are weak, and its historical performance is poor. The negative expected return suggests the potential for significant losses. The positive news items (Cathie Wood, J.P. Morgan) should be viewed with caution and require further investigation. The extremely high MRI signal should be questioned as well since there is conflicting data. While the analyst target price and potential for AI-driven drug discovery offer some hope, the risks appear to outweigh the potential rewards for most investors. A more thorough investigation of RXRX's drug pipeline, financial strategy, and the reasoning behind the recent positive news is necessary before making an investment decision.
