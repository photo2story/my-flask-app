**Overall Recommendation:** Given the significant underperformance, negative financial metrics, and high risk, a cautious approach is warranted. The hybrid signal to 'Sell' reflects a similar sentiment. Investors should closely monitor company announcements, industry trends, and global economic factors to assess potential risks and opportunities.  The current data doesn't present a compelling case for investment. It is worth noting, however, that as a clinical-stage biotech company, RXRX's value is highly dependent on successful drug development, and positive clinical trial results could significantly alter its outlook.
