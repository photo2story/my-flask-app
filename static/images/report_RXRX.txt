**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging AI and machine learning to discover and develop novel therapeutics.
*   **RXRX Cumulative Return:** -32.84%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 36.77%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: -69.6
    *   Relative Divergence: 2.7 (Indicates RXRX is near its minimum relative to its recent fluctuation range compared to VOO.)

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD Data:**

The table shows Recursion's performance relative to a benchmark over rolling 3-year periods:

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** While showing positive CAGR in all periods, the growth rate is decreasing each period (22%, 11%, 10%).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD around 80-81% suggests high volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the investment's performance on a risk-adjusted basis. Initially positive (26%), it turns negative in the later periods (-10%, -50%), meaning Recursion underperformed relative to its risk profile compared to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta is close to zero over all periods, suggesting Recursion's stock price has had almost no correlation to the market benchmark (VOO).
*   **Cap(B) - Market Cap (Billions):** Market capitalization decreased during the measured time (5.1, 3.5, 2.2), which could be one reason for the other metrics declining over time.

*   **Current Close:** 4.17
*   **Last Market Data:** Price = 4.17, Previous Close = 3.85, Change = 8.31%
*   **5-day SMA:** 4.066
*   **20-day SMA:** 4.835
*   **60-day SMA:** 5.0961

**Analysis:**

*   The recent price surge (+8.31%) is noteworthy.
*   The stock price (4.17) is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), implying a potential downtrend, but the recent price jump may signify a change in momentum.

**3) Technical Indicators and Market Risk**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommendation)

*   **Expected Return:** -180.3% (Significant negative expected return compared to S&P 500 over the long term.)

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI suggests the stock may be oversold and potentially due for a price correction (bounce back).
*   The PPO confirms the downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal is suggesting an aggressive buy based on the current market conditions, which appears to be contradicting the Expected Return.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Recursion Pharmaceuticals presents a mixed bag of signals:

*   **Negative:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, showing a large negative divergence. The negative expected return, consistently negative earnings and profit margins, the CEO's share sale, and high maximum drawdown all point to significant risks. The PPO also confirms the downtrend.
*   **Positive/Neutral:** The recent price surge and the "Buy" signal from the Hybrid Signal are positive, but should be viewed with caution due to the underlying negative factors. The oversold RSI suggests a potential bounce. The neutral analyst consensus and the focus on AI initiatives could also be considered neutral to slightly positive factors. The fact that the beta is close to zero may be a positive for some investors.

**Overall:**

While the company's AI-driven approach to drug discovery holds potential, the current financial performance and market sentiment warrant extreme caution. The negative expected return, consistent losses, and significant volatility make Recursion Pharmaceuticals a high-risk investment. The positive signals, like the recent price increase and the "Buy" signal, are not strong enough to outweigh the negative factors.
