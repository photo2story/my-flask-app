## Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc (RXRX) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

RXRX, Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc, is a biotechnology company leveraging AI to discover and develop new drugs.  The company shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with substantial negative returns and high risk indicators.  Further analysis is needed to determine if this underperformance represents an opportunity or continued decline.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

RXRX's cumulative return of -51.56% significantly lags the S&P 500's -6.69% return. The relative divergence of -44.9% places it at the 27.5th percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500, indicating substantial underperformance.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance across different time periods. High Beta values (4.0, 2.7, 1.7) suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  Negative Alphas in two of three periods indicate underperformance against the market, though the  positive Alpha in the first period is a counterpoint needing further examination.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) consistently above 77% highlights significant risk.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 12.0% | 77.3% | 1.0%  | -0.0 | 4.0 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

The stock price closed at $4.24, significantly below its previous close ($4.81), representing an 11.85% drop.  This decline is underscored by the moving averages:

* **5-day MA:** $4.945
