**7. 종합적으로 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

RXRX presents a mixed picture.  The company is in a high-growth sector (AI-driven drug discovery), and there are positive signs of pipeline expansion. However, the financial performance is weak:

*   **Significant underperformance** relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Consistent losses** (negative EPS and ROE).
*   **Inconsistent revenue**.
*   **High volatility** (high Maximum Drawdown).
*   **The extremely negative Expected Return is a major red flag.**

While analysts have a "Hold" consensus, the significant divergence in price targets reflects substantial uncertainty. The recent insider selling is also a negative indicator.  The news about expansion of rare disease pipeline and AI-driven technology are positive signs for the company.

**Conclusion:** RXRX is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The potential for long-term growth is there, but the company needs to demonstrate significant improvements in its financial performance to justify an investment. The extremely negative expected return should be carefully considered.
