The extremely negative long-term expected return strongly advises against long-term investment unless there's a substantial and sustained improvement in the company's fundamentals.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price increase and the company's future prospects is crucial before considering any investment.  This analysis should not be considered investment advice.
