**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) varies, showing some growth potential in the most recent period (2023-2025), but overall it indicates inconsistent performance.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is very high at 73.6% across all periods, indicating significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The negative Alpha values suggest that RXRX has underperformed relative to its benchmark, even after accounting for market risk. This underperformance has worsened in recent periods.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are close to zero, indicating that RXRX's price movements are not strongly correlated with the broader market (S&P 500). This could mean that RXRX's performance is driven more by company-specific factors than overall market trends.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has decreased over the periods, suggesting a decline in investor confidence or company valuation.

*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 6.294
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 5.5435
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 5.0249

*   **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 8.1 (+) (Short-term Increase)

**Analysis:**  The MRI indicates low market risk. The RSI is approaching overbought territory, suggesting the recent upward trend may be losing steam. The PPO is positive, supporting the upward trend. The Hybrid Signal recommends a cautious buy. The increase in relative divergence over the past 20 days suggests short-term positive momentum. However, the significantly negative expected return is a major red flag, indicating potentially poor long-term prospects compared to the S&P 500.
