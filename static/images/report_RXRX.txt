The company's stock significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, resulting in a large negative return difference of -60.7%.  This underperformance is notable, though not the absolute worst historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on relative divergence.

| 2021-2023  | 5.0% | 73.6% | -12.0% | 3.9 |

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $5.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $6.78

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price increase (4.07%) from the previous close might signal a short-term rebound, but sustained upward momentum is uncertain.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **Expected Return:** -255.8% (This extremely negative figure suggests a very pessimistic outlook for long-term returns relative to the S&P 500.  Further investigation is needed to understand this prediction.)
* **Recent Price Change:**  The 4.07% increase is noteworthy and might indicate a short-term positive shift.  However, given the overall negative trend, it's too early to conclude a significant reversal.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

RXRX exhibits significant risk.  The stock has substantially underperformed the S&P 500, showing consistent negative EPS and volatile financial performance. While recent price movement and some technical indicators suggest a potential short-term rebound, the fundamental picture remains weak.  The extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 raises serious concerns.  Further due diligence, including a thorough review of the company's business model, future prospects, and risk factors, is crucial before considering any investment.  The -255.8% expected return needs significant validation before being considered a reliable figure.  It's critical to understand the methodology and assumptions behind this extreme prediction.
