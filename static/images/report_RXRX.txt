**Alpha, Beta, and Risk Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 21.0%   | 98.4%   | 16.0%   | -0.0   | 4.3    |

| 2023-2025  | 4.0%    | 99.9%   | -35.0%  | 0.1    | 2.2    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows fluctuating performance. The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a modest positive CAGR of 4.0%, but this is after a negative CAGR in the preceding period.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is extremely high across all periods, indicating very high risk and volatility. A near 100% MDD suggests the stock has, at some point in each period, lost nearly all of its value from its peak.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently negative in the more recent periods (2022-2025), meaning the stock has underperformed its benchmark even when adjusted for risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta is low (around 0.1), suggesting the stock has a very low correlation with the overall market. This can be both a positive (in a down market) and a negative (in an up market).
*   **Cap:** The company's market capitalization has decreased over the observed periods, suggesting a contraction in investor confidence and/or stock value.

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of market risk.
*   The RSI is approaching overbought levels, which could signal a potential pullback.
*   The PPO is positive, which supports the idea of an upward trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal is suggesting to buy 50% of available cash, but with caution due to the medium MRI.
*   The high recent price change (3.51%) indicates a short-term positive momentum.
*   **Concerningly, the expected return is extremely negative, indicating significant long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 if current trends continue.**

**7. Overall Summary**

RXRX is a high-risk, high-potential-reward stock. It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and technical indicators are mixed. Recent news includes both positive developments (milestone payment, analyst ratings) and potential concerns (insider selling, underperformance). The company is currently unprofitable with fluctuating revenue, and negative ROE. Analyst consensus is "Hold," but with a wide target price range. The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.

**In conclusion, investing in RXRX would be a speculative bet on the company's future success in drug discovery and development. Due to the high level of risk, significant due diligence is recommended.**
