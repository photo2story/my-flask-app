2026-01-07 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) based on the information provided.

**0. Report Language:** English

**1. Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** RXRX
*   **Company Overview:** Recursion Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using AI-enabled drug discovery to develop therapeutics.
*   **RXRX Cumulative Return:** -31.43%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 39.85%
*   **Divergence:** -71.3 (current), with a relative divergence of 2.4 (indicating it's near the bottom of its historical divergence range).

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD:**

The provided table shows the stock's performance metrics over two overlapping periods:

*   **2022-2024:** CAGR of 11.0%, a significant Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 55.8%, an Alpha of -9.0%, and a Beta of 2.3. This indicates that while the stock has shown growth, it's highly volatile (high MDD) and underperformed relative to its risk (negative Alpha) compared to the market. The Beta of 2.3 suggests it's much more sensitive to market movements than the S&P 500.
*   **2023-2025:** CAGR of 9.0%, a higher MDD of 59.2%, a much lower Alpha of -53.0%, and a slightly higher Beta of 2.6. This period highlights even greater underperformance and volatility compared to the previous period.

The 'Cap(B)' values (3.8 and 2.3) represent market capitalization in billions, showing a decrease in the company's market cap over time.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** $4.20
*   **Last Market (Data from some point):** Price $4.55, Previous Close $4.37, Change 4.12%
*   **5-day SMA:** $4.16
*   **20-day SMA:** $4.43
*   **60-day SMA:** $4.91

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day, which is below the 60-day, suggesting a downtrend in the short to medium term. The 'Last Market' data showing a positive change likely reflects a recent single-day positive movement, but it doesn't necessarily reverse the established downtrend.

**3. Technical and Hybrid Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 40.10 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet there)
*   **PPO:** -0.37 (Slightly bearish momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (228 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Recommends monthly investment of 1.7% of total investment ($1,000.00).
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -218.4% (Significant negative expected return)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is not yet oversold, but it is approaching that level. The negative PPO indicates slight bearish momentum. The hybrid signal recommends a buy, with a high safety rating and a specific investment strategy. Despite the 'short-term increase' suggested by the relative divergence change, the *Expected Return* is extremely negative, suggesting that the model predicts significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

Here's a summary of the news headlines:

*   **Positive Sentiment:** Several articles highlight analyst upgrades (JPMorgan) and positive clinical data.

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** Some articles question the company's valuation and suggest better alternatives.
*   **Volatility:** Mentions of volatile share performance.
*   **Partnerships:** Notes ongoing tech partnerships.

**Analysis:** The news presents a mixed picture. The analyst upgrades and Cathie Wood's investment are positive signals. However, the counterarguments and mentions of volatility highlight the risks associated with the stock. The "Forget Recursion..." headline is clearly negative.

*   **Consensus:** No key or mean consensus provided.
*   **Opinions:** 7 analysts covering the stock.
*   **Target Price:** Average $7.00, High $11.00, Low $3.00

**Analysis:** The wide range in target prices ($3.00 to $11.00) suggests significant disagreement among analysts regarding the stock's future potential. The average target price is higher than the current price, implying potential upside, but the low target price indicates that some analysts see significant downside risk.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Highly variable, with some quarters at $0.00B and others higher. This lack of consistent revenue is a concern.

*   **Equity:** Relatively stable, although there have been fluctuations.
*   **ROE:** Consistently negative, reflecting the company's inability to generate profits from its equity.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

RXRX presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.

*   **Negative Performance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a very negative expected return.
*   **High Volatility:** High MDD and Beta values indicate substantial price swings.
*   **Uncertain Profitability:** The company is consistently unprofitable, with fluctuating and generally low revenue, and negative profit margins and ROE.
*   **Mixed Signals:** While some analysts are optimistic (analyst upgrades, high target prices), others are not, and the news flow is mixed. Cathie Wood's continued investment is a notable positive. The technical indicators are currently mixed.
*   **AI Drug Discovery:** The company's reliance on AI-driven drug discovery is both a potential strength and a risk. If successful, this approach could lead to significant breakthroughs. However, the field is still relatively new and unproven.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Investing in RXRX is speculative. The company's financial performance is weak, and its stock price has underperformed. However, the potential for breakthroughs in AI-driven drug discovery and the positive analyst sentiment suggest that there is potential for significant upside. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in RXRX. The extremely negative *Expected Return* calculated by the provided system is a major red flag.
