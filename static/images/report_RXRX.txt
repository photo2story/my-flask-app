**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** RXRX has positive CAGR, suggesting growth, but fluctuating.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant risk and volatility. MDD remains consistently high over the analyzed periods, indicating substantial potential losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is inconsistent, showing positive alpha in the 2021-2023 period but significantly negative alpha in later periods. Negative alpha indicates underperformance relative to its benchmark index.
*   **Beta:** Low Beta suggests RXRX has a low correlation with the market.
*   **Cap:** The market capitalization decreases over time, indicating a possible decline in investor confidence or overall company value.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 4.66
*   **Last Market (Price, Previous Close, Change):** 4.71, 4.92, -4.27%
*   **5-day SMA:** 4.51
*   **20-day SMA:** 4.41
*   **60-day SMA:** 5.08

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 60-day SMA, but above its 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend but with recent negative movement (-4.27% change from the previous close).  The negative change in the last market indicates recent selling pressure.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.24 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 1.52 (Slightly Positive Momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (225 shares - Very Safe - MRI: 0.90) Monthly invest 1.7% of total investment ($1,000.00)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 1.9 (+)
*   **Expected Return:** -180.9%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI indicates a medium investment recommendation, suggesting moderate risk.
*   RSI around 50 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   PPO is slightly positive, suggesting short-term upward momentum.
*   The hybrid signal suggests a buy strategy with low cash allocation, viewing the current price as opportune.
*   The positive divergence change (1.9) indicates a short-term upward trend.
*   **The extremely negative expected return (-180.9%) is a major red flag, suggesting the model predicts significant losses in the long term compared to S&P 500.  This is a critical point to consider.** The {'price': 4.71, 'previousClose': 4.92, 'change': -4.27} showing a recent -4.27% change reflects volatility.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Meme Stock Discussion:** Suggests potential for speculative trading and volatility.
*   **Exscientia Merger & Clinical Data:** Key events that could significantly impact the stock.
*   **Earnings Report Reaction:** Indicates positive market reaction since the last earnings report.
*   **Insider Selling:** Director selling a substantial amount of stock is generally considered a negative signal, suggesting lack of confidence in the company's future performance.
*   **CEO Selling Shares:** Further selling by insiders contributes to the negative sentiment.
*   **AI Adoption:** Suggests the potential for positive impact from AI, aligning with the company's strategy.

**Analysis:**  The news paints a mixed picture. Positive news includes discussion of AI adoption benefits and reactions to earnings. However, the significant insider selling is a major concern and warrants further investigation.  The discussion as a meme stock introduces speculative risk. The merger and clinical data readout are potential catalysts for change, both positive and negative.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Opinions:** 6 Analysts
*   **Target Price:** Average: 6.33, High: 10.00, Low: 3.00

**Analysis:** The analyst target prices are wide-ranging (3.00 to 10.00), indicating uncertainty in the company's future valuation. The average target price is higher than the current price, suggesting potential upside, but the lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess current sentiment.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 2025-11-05 | -0.34 | 0.03 B$    |

**Analysis:** RXRX is consistently losing money, as indicated by the negative EPS. Revenue is relatively low.  While EPS improved slightly in the most recent quarter (comparing same quarter year-over-year), it's crucial to see sustained improvement.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.00B  | -194.74%      |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.02B  | -5.54%       |

| 2024-09-30 | $0.03B  | 53.69%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE    |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| 2025-09-30 | $1.05B  | -15.50% |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.92B  | -18.70% |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.93B  | -21.68% |
| 2024-12-31 | $1.03B  | -17.29% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.52B  | -18.27% |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue generation is inconsistent and generally low. The quarter ending September 30, 2025, showed zero revenue, which is concerning.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are significantly negative, indicating substantial losses.  The 53.69% in 2024-09-30 is an outlier and needs further investigation to determine if it's sustainable.
*   **Equity:** Equity shows some fluctuations but generally remains above $0.9B, reflecting the company's assets.
*   **ROE:** Negative Return on Equity (ROE) indicates that the company is not generating profits from its equity. The persistently negative ROE is a significant concern.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

RXRX presents a mixed bag. On the positive side, the company is positioned in a growth area (AI-driven drug discovery) and has positive, though inconsistent, revenue and CAGR.  The MRI suggests medium risk, and the hybrid signal recommends buying.

However, significant concerns exist:

*   **Underperformance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** High MDD indicates significant volatility.
*   **Insider Selling:** Heavy insider selling is a strong negative signal.
*   **Profitability:** The company is not profitable, with negative EPS, negative profit margins, and negative ROE. The expected return is alarming.
*   **Uncertainty:** Wide analyst target prices suggest uncertainty in the stock's future.
*   **Meme Stock Risk:** The potential for meme stock status introduces speculative risk and volatility unrelated to fundamentals.

**Conclusion:**  Based on the data provided, RXRX appears to be a **high-risk investment.** While the company has potential in the AI-driven drug discovery space, the consistent losses, insider selling, and significant underperformance relative to the market are major red flags. The extremely negative expected return is particularly concerning.  A potential investor should conduct significant due diligence, carefully evaluate the risks, and consider a small allocation if pursuing the stock. Focus on the upcoming clinical data results from the Exscientia merger as the potential to change the negative trajectory of the company.
