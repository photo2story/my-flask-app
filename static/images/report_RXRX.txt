## Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RXRX) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

RXRX, Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc., is a biotechnology company focused on drug discovery.  The company shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes.


**1) Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **RXRX Cumulative Return:** -59.09%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 20.33%
* **Return Difference:** -79.4%  This indicates RXRX significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
* **Relative Divergence:** -79.4% falls within the observed historical range (min: -86.4%, max: 35.9%), indicating a position at the 5.7th percentile (meaning it's significantly worse than the majority of past performance).

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -9.0%  | 47.3%  | -11.0% | 4.1    |        |
| 2022-2024  | 2.0%   | 64.0%  | -20.0% | 2.8    |        |
| 2023-2025  | -18.0% | 64.0%  | -58.0% | 2.1    |        |


The consistently negative alpha values suggest underperformance compared to the market benchmark.  The high beta values (above 1) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The capitalization (Cap(B)) is missing from the provided data.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $5.09
* **Last Market Price:** $5.27 (3.39% increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $5.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $6.23
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $7.26

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price increase of 3.39% might be a temporary bounce, needs further confirmation.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.13 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions, but not a buy signal on its own)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.7% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -394.5% (This extremely negative expected return needs further clarification, possibly referring to a specific scenario or model).  The extremely high negative return strongly suggests significant risk and low potential for S&P 500 outperformance.

The wildly fluctuating profit margins highlight the instability of the business.  The large negative profit margin in Q4 2024 is particularly concerning.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, characterized by substantial losses, negative alpha, high beta, and low revenue.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The financial statements show consistent net losses and negative ROE.  The extremely negative expected return highlights the high risk associated with this investment.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, this alone is insufficient to justify an investment.  A thorough examination of the company's future prospects, including its pipeline and research & development activities, is crucial before considering any investment.  Currently, the data suggests significant risk and very little chance of outperforming the S&P 500 in the long term.
