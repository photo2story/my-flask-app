**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 5.0% | 73.6% | -10.0% | 4.0   |

| 2023-2025  | 2.0% | 73.6% | -9.0% | 2.2   |

The negative alpha values consistently show underperformance relative to the benchmark, while the high beta values (above 1) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The shrinking market capitalization also suggests a decline in investor confidence.

* **Day Change:** -4.34%
* **5-day Moving Average:** $4.88

* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.0% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -324.5% (This extremely negative figure suggests a very pessimistic outlook over the long term compared to the S&P 500.  This needs further investigation and is likely overly dramatic, possibly due to a flawed calculation method.)
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk) - This adds to the cautionary signal.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

RXRX exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, characterized by substantial losses, negative EPS, and negative profit margins.  Technical indicators suggest a downtrend, and the high market risk indicator signals caution. The extremely negative projected long-term return (-324.5%) should be treated with extreme skepticism given its implausibility and likely flawed calculation. While the company is innovating in AI-driven drug discovery, the current financial performance raises serious concerns about its viability.  Further investigation into the causes of the dramatic profit margin shift and reassessment of the expected return calculation is highly recommended before any investment decisions are made.  This stock is currently exhibiting high risk and low potential for reward based on the provided data.
