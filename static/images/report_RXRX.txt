*   **Beta:** Low Beta values suggest RXRX is less sensitive to overall market movements (S&P 500).
*   **Cap:** The market capitalization has declined over the periods.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.5 indicates a "Low Investment" recommendation, suggesting moderate risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 60.12 is close to the overbought territory (70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends to buy with all cash with monthly investment of 1.8% and it claims Very Safe with MRI of 0.90.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** The positive change in relative divergence indicates recent short-term outperformance, corroborating recent headlines about price increases.
*   **Expected Return:** The negative expected return of -30.0% is a major concern.  This suggests that, even with long-term accumulation, the model predicts RXRX will underperform the S&P 500.

*   **Target Price:** Average: $6.47, High: $10.00, Low: $3.00

**Analysis:**  Analyst consensus is a "Hold" with a target price range suggesting potential upside (average target $6.47 vs current $5.86), but also significant downside risk (low target $3.00).  The lack of recent rating changes could mean no major changes of opinion.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출     |
|------------|-------|----------|
| 2025-08-05 | -0.41 | 0.02 B$ |

**6. Financial Information**

|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30 | $0.02B  | -5.54%        |

| 2024-09-30 | $0.52B  | -18.27%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.58B  | -16.69%  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is very low. Profit margins are generally negative, except for two quarters. The dramatically negative profit margin in Q4 2024 is concerning.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively high, suggesting the company has significant assets. However, the negative Return on Equity (ROE) consistently indicates that the company is not generating profit from its equity. The decline in equity in recent quarters is also a negative trend.

**7. Overall Assessment**

Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   High volatility (high MDD).
    *   Consistently negative EPS and inconsistent revenue.
    *   Negative expected return.
    *   Recent sharp price decline.
    *   Inconsistent analyst opinions.

*   **Positives:**
    *   AI focus provides future potential.
    *   Analyst target prices indicate potential upside.
    *   Hybrid signal recommends to buy 100% of cash.

**Conclusion:** RXRX is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The company's focus on AI in drug discovery is promising, but it is not yet reflected in its financial performance.  The negative expected return and recent price decline are major red flags. Investors should be cautious and conduct thorough due diligence before investing. The recent news cycle and mixed market signals indicates that the stock is heavily impacted by short-term volatility due to speculation on its AI breakthroughs.
