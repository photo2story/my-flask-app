## Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RXRX) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

RXRX, Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc., is a biotechnology company using AI to discover and develop new drugs.  The company shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

RXRX's cumulative return of -49.6% significantly lags the S&P 500's 12.1% return.  The current divergence of -61.7%  places it at the 11.3th percentile of its historical range (-73% to 26.6%).

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals consistently negative alpha and high beta across the observed periods. This suggests underperformance compared to the market (negative alpha) and high volatility (high beta).  The shrinking market capitalization is also a concern.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 5.0% | 73.6% | -12.0% | 4.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 0.0% | 73.6% | -22.0% | 2.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 2.0% | 73.6% | -9.0% | 2.2 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $5.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $5.546
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $5.3867
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $6.8424

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price increase (3.38%) from the previous close might be a short-term fluctuation.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 47.01 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 2.40 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, although not strongly so given the price action)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +3.5 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -282.8% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 indicates significant risk and potential for further losses in the long term).  The high negative value is concerning. The current price jump doesn't automatically invalidate this long-term negative outlook.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company shows consistent negative EPS and relatively low revenue, indicating substantial losses.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) shows significant underperformance relative to the market, consistently negative earnings, and worrying financial indicators. The high beta suggests substantial volatility.  While a recent small price increase and some positive short-term momentum indicators exist, the overall picture is highly negative.  The projected long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is exceptionally large and concerning.  This stock carries substantial risk, and long-term investment should be approached with extreme caution.  Further investigation into the company's long-term strategy and pipeline is crucial before considering any investment.
