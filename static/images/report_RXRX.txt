### 7. 종합 Analysis (Summary)

RXRX has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly.

**Overall Recommendation:**  Given the significant underperformance, negative financial metrics, and high volatility, a cautious approach is warranted. While there might be short-term trading opportunities based on recent price action, the long-term outlook appears uncertain. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing in RXRX. It's crucial to monitor news and company announcements closely.
