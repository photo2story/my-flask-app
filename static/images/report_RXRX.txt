*   **Previous Close:** $4.40
*   **Change:** -3.41%
*   **5-day SMA:** $4.334
*   **20-day SMA:** $4.5043
*   **60-day SMA:** $4.9864

**Analysis:** RXRX's current price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This is generally considered a bearish signal, suggesting a downtrend. The negative change from the previous close further confirms this downward momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO, and other Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - This is a contradictory signal given the other data.
*   **RSI:** 38.50 - This is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), suggesting the stock may be due for a potential bounce.
*   **PPO:** -0.0178 - The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being negative suggests a bearish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (225 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.7% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.5 (단기하락 - Short-term decline) - This confirms the recent negative trend.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -552.1 - This is a dramatically negative expected return, indicating significant concerns about the company's future performance.

**Analysis:** While the MRI suggests high investment recommended, most other indicators paint a bearish picture. The RSI is approaching oversold, which *could* signal a short-term buying opportunity, but the overall trend is negative, as indicated by the PPO and divergence change. The dramatically negative expected return is a major red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Signals:**
    *   **Cathie Wood Buying:** Cathie Wood's increased investment suggests conviction from a prominent investor.
    *   **Analyst Upgrade (JPMorgan):** Upgrades can lead to increased investor confidence and buying pressure.
*   **Mixed Signals:**
    *   **Analyst Focus on REC-4881 & CEO Transition:** Highlights both potential catalysts (drug data) and uncertainty (CEO change).
*   **Neutral Signals:**
    *  "$RXRX stock is up 4% today. Here's what we see in our data." - This signals very short-term positive changes, rather than indicating long-term potential.

**Analysis:** Recent news presents a mixed bag. Cathie Wood's investment and the JPMorgan upgrade are positive signals. However, the CEO transition adds uncertainty, and the focus on specific drug data highlights the binary risk associated with biotech companies.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 2.50)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: $7.00, High: $11.00, Low: $3.00

**Analysis:** The "Hold" consensus reflects the uncertainty surrounding RXRX. The wide range in target prices ($3.00 to $11.00) indicates significant disagreement among analysts about the company's potential. There are no Recent Rating Changes available.

**6) Financial Information:**

| 2024-09-30   | $0.52B    | -18.27%   |

**Analysis:** Revenue is inconsistent and low, resulting in negative profit margins for most quarters. The negative ROE (Return on Equity) indicates the company is not generating profits from its equity. Equity is fluctuating from 0.52B to 1.05B over the course of the year.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

RXRX is a high-risk, high-reward biotech company.

*   **Negative Performance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Bearish Trend:** Technical indicators suggest a downtrend.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Recent news offers some positive catalysts (Cathie Wood, analyst upgrade) but also uncertainty (CEO transition, binary drug trial risk).
*   **Uncertain Analyst Outlook:** The "Hold" consensus and wide target price range reflect uncertainty.
*   **Unprofitable:** The company is consistently losing money, and revenue is low.
*   **High Risk:** The negative expected return and high MDD suggest significant risk.

**Overall:**  While there are some potentially positive catalysts, the overall picture is concerning. The significant underperformance, negative financial metrics, and uncertain analyst outlook make this a speculative investment with substantial risk. The high MRI, despite all the other negative signals, is an anomaly and should be viewed with extreme caution.
