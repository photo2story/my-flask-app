**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
| :----------- | :----- | :----- | :------ | :---- | :------- |
| 2021-2023  | 5.0%   | 73.6%  | -1.0%   | -0.1  | 4.3    |
| 2022-2024  | 0.0%   | 73.6%  | -25.0%  | 0.1   | 2.9    |
| 2023-2025  | 0.0%   | 73.6%  | -47.0%  | 0.1   | 2.3    |

**Analysis:** The table reveals several concerning trends.

*   **Negative Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha values indicate that RXRX has underperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis across all periods. This suggests poor stock selection or market timing.
*   **Beta Around 0:** Beta values hovering around 0 indicate that RXRX's price movements are not strongly correlated with the broader market. This could imply that the stock is influenced more by company-specific factors or sector-specific trends rather than overall market movements.
*   **High Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** The consistent MDD of 73.6% across all periods signals extremely high risk and volatility associated with RXRX. This means that investors have experienced significant losses from peak to trough during these periods.
*   **Declining Capital:** The decrease in market capitalization from 4.3B to 2.3B over time may reflect a decline in investor confidence or an overall reduction in market value.

### 2. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** $5.22
*   **Previous Close:** $5.28
*   **Change:** -1.14%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 5.417
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 5.184
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 4.9759

**Analysis:** The current price is below the 5-day moving average, but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a possible short-term downward trend, but the price is still trading above longer term averages. The modest price drop suggests no major volatility.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.341 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 50.0 (Neutral)

*   **Expected Return:** -1351.7% (Significant long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates low market risk. RSI and PPO are neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The hybrid signal leans towards a buy, albeit with caution. The recent increase in relative divergence is a positive sign. However, the exceptionally low expected return raises serious concerns about long-term investment potential. The minor price change of -1.14% doesn't appear to be a significant volatility event.

### 7. Overall Analysis

RXRX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. The stock's volatility is high. Financials show inconsistent revenue, generally negative profit margins, and negative ROE. Recent news indicates potential catalysts for price movements. While the MRI shows low market risk and technical indicators are neutral, the extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. Considering the negative EPS, volatile performance, high risk, and negative expected returns, **a cautious or bearish stance appears warranted.** Further research into the specific catalysts mentioned in the news, upcoming clinical trial results, and potential funding events is crucial.
