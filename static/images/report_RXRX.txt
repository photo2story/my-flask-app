The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day average highlights the recent decline.  The price also experienced a recent drop of -5.67% from the previous close.

* **PPO:** 2.10 (positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.5 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -333.5% (This extremely negative figure suggests a very pessimistic outlook, possibly reflecting extreme risk or significant negative expectations.)

The financial data reveals significant challenges.  Profit margins are erratic and frequently negative.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RXRX presents a high-risk investment.  The company is experiencing significant financial challenges, reflected in consistently negative EPS, volatile revenue, negative profit margins, and negative ROE.  The stock's substantial underperformance against the S&P 500, coupled with a high beta, indicates considerable volatility.  While some short-term technical indicators hint at a potential bounce, the overall fundamental picture remains weak.  The extremely negative projected long-term return (-333.5%) strongly cautions against long-term investment unless there's a significant change in the company's operational and financial performance.  Any investment decision should be made after thorough due diligence and consideration of the significant risks involved.
