**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

RXRX's cumulative return of -39.06% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's 16.33% return.  The current divergence of -55.4% places it in the 13.8th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-78.6% to 89.8%). This highlights significant underperformance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance across different periods:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2023-2025  | -6.0% | 99.9% | -42.0% | 0.1 | 1.9 |

High Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) indicate significant volatility. The inconsistent Alpha values suggest that the stock's returns are not consistently explained by market movements.  The declining Beta suggests decreasing market sensitivity over time.
