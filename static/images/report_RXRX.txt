2025-12-13 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down the analysis of Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX).

**0) Overview and Instructions Followed**

This report analyzes the performance of Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), considering recent stock performance, technical indicators, news, analyst opinions, and financial data. The analysis follows the instructions provided, beginning with simple numbers and progressing to more complex analysis and summarization.

**1) RXRX vs. S&P 500 (VOO) Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Recursion Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to discover and develop therapeutics.
*   **RXRX Cumulative Return:** -22.75%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 44.36%
*   **Divergence:** -67.8 (Relative Divergence: 3.8)

**Analysis:**

RXRX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The divergence shows a substantial difference in cumulative returns.  The relative divergence of 3.8 suggests the current divergence is near the lowest end of its historical range, indicating a potentially oversold condition *if* historical patterns are predictive. The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals some concerning trends. While the 2021-2023 period showed positive Alpha (outperformance relative to the market), the Alpha turned negative in subsequent periods. The Beta is low (around 0.1), suggesting the stock is not strongly correlated with the overall market, which can be good in a down market, but also means RXRX won't benefit as much from overall market gains. The high MDD shows that investors should be cautious due to the high risk.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** $4.77
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: $4.33, Previous Close: $4.58, Change: -5.46%
*   **5-day SMA:** $4.80
*   **20-day SMA:** $4.43
*   **60-day SMA:** $5.08

**Analysis:**

The stock price experienced a significant drop in the last market day (-5.46%), closing at $4.33. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which *could* be interpreted as a short-term bullish signal, but the close is below both, which may cause these averages to turn. However, the 60-day SMA is significantly higher than the 20-day SMA, which, from a pure moving average perspective, could be viewed as a negative sign, as the stock is still trading significantly below it's recent history..

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 66.52
*   **PPO:** 2.06
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (228 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.7% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -128.3%

**Analysis:**

The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. An RSI of 66.52 is approaching overbought territory. The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 2.06 indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, suggesting upward momentum. The Hybrid Signal recommends buying aggressively. The recent positive change in relative divergence aligns with the short-term upward movement suggested by the PPO. *However,* the *very* negative expected return is a major red flag. This suggests that even with a long-term investment horizon, the models predict significant losses.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **[2025-12-08]** Positive TUPELO REC-4881 Trial Data Release leads to stock increase.
*   **[2025-12-08]** Data analysis triggers 5% stock increase.
*   **[2025-11-12]** Article suggesting alternative AI stock is better.
*   **[2025-12-10]** Seeking Alpha article expressing disappointment in Recursion Pharmaceuticals.
*   **[2025-11-07]** Analysts lifting estimates after Q3 earnings.
*   **[2025-11-26]** Share registration for resale by Tempus AI.

**Analysis:**

The news paints a mixed picture. The positive trial data and initial market reaction are encouraging. However, the negative Seeking Alpha article, the article promoting a competitor, and the share resale by Tempus AI are potential concerns. The analyst estimates suggest the company will do well but this is mixed as well by the negative Seeking Alpha Article.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 2.62 (Hold)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 6
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** $6.33 / $10.00 / $3.00

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is a "Hold" with a mean rating leaning towards Hold.  The average target price of $6.33 suggests potential upside from the current price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices ($3 to $10) indicates significant uncertainty among analysts. There are no recent rating changes listed.

The 2024-09-30 quarter stands out with a positive profit margin, but it is not sustainable as it returns to negative.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable above $900M in the recent quarters. ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, reflecting the company's inability to generate profit from its equity base.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Factors:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The company is consistently losing money, with negative EPS, low revenue, and negative profit margins. The expected return is extremely negative. News sentiment is mixed, with some articles highlighting concerns.
*   **Potentially Positive Factors:** Recent positive trial data has provided a short-term boost. The MRI suggests moderate risk. Analyst price targets suggest potential upside, although with wide divergence.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in RXRX appears risky based on the available data. The company's consistent losses, negative expected return, and underperformance relative to the market are significant concerns. While positive trial data and analyst price targets offer some hope, they do not outweigh the fundamental financial challenges.
