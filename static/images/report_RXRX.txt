The company's high beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  The extremely negative expected return (-293.1%) strongly advises against long-term investment unless a significant change in the company's financial performance occurs.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for the company's struggles and the assumptions behind the expected return calculation is crucial before considering any investment.  This stock carries substantial risk.
