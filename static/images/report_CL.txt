## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) is a multinational consumer goods company specializing in oral hygiene, personal care, and pet nutrition products.

The cumulative return of CL is 35.38%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference is -81.1%, placing it at the 2.9th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates considerable underperformance compared to the broader market.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta consistently around 0.2, suggesting low market sensitivity), with varying CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures across different periods.  While positive Alpha values suggest outperformance in some periods,  the overall trend reflects underperformance in relation to the benchmark over the longer term.  Note that the very high ROE values in certain quarters (in Capital and Profitability section below) appear unusually high and warrant further investigation for accuracy.  Negative Equity values also merit careful scrutiny.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 12.0% | 12.6% | -15.0% | 0.2 | 72.0 |
| 2016-2018  | -7.0% | 13.9% | -22.0% | 0.2 | 72.0 |

| 2020-2022  | 16.0% | 21.5% | 9.0% | 0.2 | 72.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -6.0% | 16.2% | -30.0% | 0.2 | 72.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $88.58
* 5-day Moving Average: $87.51
* 20-day Moving Average: $90.10
* 60-day Moving Average: $93.01

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* RSI: 27.93 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* PPO: -0.11 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* 20-day Relative Strength Change: +0.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* Expected Return (2+ years): -1585.6% (This extremely negative figure needs clarification and verification.  It likely indicates a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, given the past underperformance. The data source and calculation method should be reviewed.)

The current price of $88.58 does not indicate any significant recent sharp price movements (no rapid jumps or drops are evident based on the provided data).  The negative expected return is a major concern.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 0.9  | $5.03 B       |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.89 | $5.06 B       |
| 2024-04-26 | 0.83 | $5.07 B       |
| 2023-10-27 | 0.86 | $4.92 B       |
| 2024-10-25 | 0.86 | $4.92 B       | *(Duplicate entry - likely an error)*

Revenue is relatively stable, showing minor fluctuations. EPS shows slight growth in the latest quarter but overall shows a trend that needs further analysis to assess long-term sustainability.  The duplicate entry needs correction.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $5.03B | 61.08% |
| 2024-06-30 | $5.06B | 60.62% |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.07B | 60.00% |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.95B | 59.60% |
| 2023-09-30 | $4.92B | 58.54% |

Profit margins are consistently high but show a slight downward trend.  Revenue remains relatively stable.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.43B | 169.43% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.12B | 594.31% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.23B | 296.96% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.61B | 117.90% |
| 2023-09-30 | $-0.01B | -7866.67% |

The ROE figures are highly erratic and require thorough investigation.  The negative equity and exceptionally high ROE values in some quarters suggest potential data errors or require detailed explanation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

CL's performance significantly lags behind the S&P 500. While revenue and profit margins remain relatively strong, concerns arise from the inconsistent performance (Alpha and Beta analysis), highly volatile and questionable ROE figures, and an extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the market. The technical indicators suggest an oversold condition but not necessarily a strong buying signal.  Before considering any investment, further investigation into the data discrepancies, particularly regarding ROE and Equity figures, is crucial. The projected return of -1585.6% should be validated from a reliable source.  A thorough analysis of the company's fundamentals, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is necessary before making any investment decision.
