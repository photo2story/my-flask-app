## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is a consumer goods company specializing in oral hygiene products, personal care items, and pet nutrition.  Its cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO).  Recent earnings show stable revenue, though profit margins and ROE fluctuate considerably.  The stock's price is currently above its 5 and 20-day moving averages but below its 60-day average, suggesting some near-term uncertainty.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** CL: 27.74%, VOO (S&P 500): 66.36%
* **Return Difference:** CL underperformed VOO by 38.6 percentage points.  This places it at the 36.3rd percentile of its historical range of underperformance against the S&P 500 (-64.8% to +7.4%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO).  While Alpha values indicate periods of outperformance (particularly 2019-2021), Beta consistently suggests a relatively high market sensitivity.  Note that these are historical values and don't predict future performance.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) also fluctuates.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $94.0
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $90.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $90.14

The price is above its short-term moving averages but below the longer-term average, suggesting a potential consolidation or minor upward trend.  The recent price increase (from $91.8 to $94.0) is a notable positive change.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.06 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.097 (Slightly bearish)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -18.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -63.6% (Significant underperformance projected)


The relatively high MRI and negative PPO suggest caution.  The recent price jump might be a temporary rebound, and the negative expected return highlights the significant underperformance projected against the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows relatively stable revenue around $5 billion, with EPS slightly fluctuating but generally showing a slight increase. However, there's a data duplication for October 25th, 2024.  Further investigation into the data source is needed to clarify this inconsistency.


| Date       | EPS | Revenue     |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 0.9 | $5.03 B     |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.89 | $5.06 B     |
| 2024-04-26 | 0.83 | $5.07 B     |
| 2023-10-27 | 0.86 | $4.92 B     |
| 2024-10-25 | 0.86 | $4.92 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profit margins show relative stability in recent quarters, with profit margins consistently above 60%. However, the Equity and Return on Equity (ROE) figures are highly volatile, suggesting potential short-term issues or accounting practices that warrant further investigation.  The extraordinarily high ROE values in several quarters need to be carefully examined to understand the underlying drivers.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $4.95B | 60.30% |
| 2024-09-30 | $5.03B | 61.08% |
| 2024-06-30 | $5.06B | 60.62% |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.07B | 60.00% |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.95B | 59.60% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.21B | 348.58% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.43B | 169.43% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.12B | 594.31% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.23B | 296.96% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.61B | 117.90% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive shows stable revenue but significantly underperforms the S&P 500.  While recent price action shows some positive momentum, technical indicators and the projected long-term return relative to the market raise concerns. The high volatility in ROE and the duplicated earnings data require further investigation.  Before making any investment decisions, a deeper dive into the financial statements and a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the ROE fluctuations are crucial.  The current data suggests that while CL might be a stable company, its potential for outperformance against the market is limited based on the presented information.
