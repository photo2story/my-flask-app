## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is a leading consumer goods company specializing in oral hygiene, personal care, and home care products.  The company's cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO). Recent price action shows a short-term upward trend, but momentum indicators suggest potential overbought conditions. Earnings show stable revenue but fluctuating profitability.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive's cumulative return of 46.19% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's return of 85.44% over the analyzed period. The current relative divergence of -39.3% indicates that CL's performance lies below the S&P 500, though its relative position within historical volatility (-39.3%  compared to a range of -71.8% to 7.0%) isn't exceptionally poor.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results. While Alpha (outperformance relative to the market) is generally positive in some periods,  it's notably high (1.1) in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 suggesting potential outperformance, although this is likely affected by higher Beta (market sensitivity), particularly in these periods.  The substantial fluctuations in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlight the volatility of its returns.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $96.0
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $93.99
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $92.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $89.73

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The recent price change of +2.62 from the previous close indicates a recent price jump, though not necessarily a sustained trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 73.77 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.3832 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +12.1% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -53.6% (Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 expected over the long term).  This suggests considerable risk compared to investing in a broader market index.


The recent price jump (2.62) contributes to the high RSI, suggesting potential for a short-term correction.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS | Revenue        |
|------------|-----|----------------|

| 2024-10-25 | 0.86 | $4.92 Billion  | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*

Revenue remains relatively stable around $5 Billion, but EPS shows some fluctuation.  Further investigation into the reasons for EPS variation is needed.  The duplicate entry requires clarification.

| 2023-12-31 | $0.61B | 117.90%      |

ROE (Return on Equity) is highly volatile, indicating significant fluctuations in profitability relative to equity. This requires further investigation to understand the underlying drivers.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) shows mixed performance. While revenue is stable and profit margins are healthy, the company's stock price has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  The high volatility in ROE and the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 are major concerns.  Short-term price action suggests an upward trend, but high RSI levels indicate potential overbought conditions.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of fluctuating EPS and ROE before making any investment decisions.  The data provided contains inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) requiring further clarification from the source.  The -53.6% expected return strongly suggests that this stock is not an attractive option for long-term investment in comparison to broader market indexes.
