## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Report

**0) Summary of Key Figures:**

Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) is a consumer goods company specializing in oral hygiene, personal care, and home care products.  The company's cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO).  Recent earnings show stable revenue, and financial data reveals high, but volatile profitability ratios.  The stock price shows a recent slight decline, though it's currently above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (CL):** 38.04%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 76.08%
* **Return Difference (CL vs VOO):** -38.04%
* **Relative Divergence:** -38.0 (placing it in the lower 38.6% of historical performance relative to VOO based on the provided min/max range).


The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results.  While Alpha (the measure of excess return relative to the market) is frequently positive, indicating outperformance at certain times, the Beta (a measure of volatility relative to the market) fluctuates and is generally high. This suggests CL's returns are significantly affected by overall market movements, often amplifying those movements.  The high Beta is characteristic of a company with higher-than-average price volatility, which makes it riskier for investors. The varying CAGR and MDD(Maximum Drawdown) also point to the volatility in performance over time.

**2) Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $93.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $93.71
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $92.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $90.44

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor recent downturn.  However, it trades above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a relatively positive trend over the medium and long term. The daily price change of -$0.82 represents a small (approximately -0.87%) negative change from the previous close.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 50.77 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.17 (Slightly bullish, but close to neutral)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +3.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -58.6% (This suggests significantly lower returns than the S&P 500 over the long term based on current metrics.  The exceptionally negative value requires further investigation as to the methodology and underlying assumptions.)

The technical indicators paint a relatively neutral picture.  The slightly positive PPO and increasing relative divergence suggest potential short-term upward movement, but the RSI near 50 and the negative expected return present a more cautious outlook.

Equity and ROE show significant volatility.  The extremely high ROE figures in certain quarters warrant further investigation to ensure data accuracy and to understand the underlying drivers of such fluctuations.  These high ROE figures could suggest leveraged operations or accounting peculiarities.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive shows stable revenue and high profit margins, indicating a financially healthy company. However, the stockâ€™s underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high Beta, and volatile ROE figures raise concerns. The relatively negative expected return also calls for caution.  The provided data contains some inconsistencies (duplicate entries, extremely high ROE figures), requiring further verification before drawing definitive conclusions.  Further investigation into the drivers of the high ROE and the methodology for calculating the expected return is crucial.  While the company appears fundamentally sound, its significant underperformance against the market and the volatility in several key metrics warrant a cautious approach.  A more comprehensive analysis including consideration of industry benchmarks, competitive landscape, and macro-economic factors is needed for a complete evaluation.
