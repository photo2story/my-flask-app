## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is a leading consumer goods company specializing in oral hygiene, personal care, and pet nutrition products.  Its cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO). Recent price action shows a slight downward trend, and while the RSI suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, the negative expected return and significantly lower CAGR than VOO raise concerns.  Earnings and revenue show stability, but profitability metrics show volatility.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (CL):** 27.00%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 66.27%
* **Return Difference:** -39.3% (35.3% relative to historical range)

CL significantly underperformed VOO over the analyzed period.  The alpha values indicate that CL's performance often deviated from the market (beta).  While alpha has been positive in several periods, suggesting outperformance, the overall picture in relation to VOO's performance is negative.  The beta is generally around 1, suggesting a similar volatility to the market, but some periods shows significant beta-deviation. The market capitalization (Cap) fluctuates but generally shows growth.

* **Change:** -$0.76 (Slight Decrease)
* **5-Day MA:** $93.05
* **20-Day MA:** $92.07
* **60-Day MA:** $90.36

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, indicating a recent downward trend.  It is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential support levels.  The recent decrease of $0.76 reflects the relatively modest price change.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.60 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.1968 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum but weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -16.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -66.4% (Significant underperformance compared to S&P 500 expected over the long term)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture.  The slightly positive PPO and RSI near the neutral level indicate a lack of strong momentum in either direction.  The negative relative divergence change and the very negative expected return raise concerns about future performance compared to the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-25 | $0.90 | $5.03 B       |
| 2024-07-26 | $0.89 | $5.06 B       |
| 2024-04-26 | $0.83 | $5.07 B       |
| 2023-10-27 | $0.86 | $4.92 B       |
| 2024-10-25 | $0.86 | $4.92 B       |

There seems to be a slight discrepancy in the data (duplicate 2024-10-25 entries). Assuming these are errors, the revenue remains fairly consistent, with a slight downward trend at the end of the year. EPS also shows stability, but  a minor dip in Q1 2024.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500. While its revenue and profit margins show a relatively stable picture, its ROE and equity are highly volatile.  The negative expected return, coupled with mixed technical indicators, suggests caution. The price is slightly below its short-term moving averages, indicating a recent downward trend, despite being above the long-term moving average.  Before making an investment decision, a thorough investigation into the reasons behind the volatile ROE and the significant underperformance against the market is necessary.  Long-term investors should carefully weigh the potential risks against the relatively stable revenue and profit margins.  The significantly negative projected long-term return (relative to VOO) is a significant concern.
