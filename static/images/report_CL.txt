* **5-day Moving Average:** $86.77
* **20-day Moving Average:** $87.72
* **60-day Moving Average:** $90.46

* **PPO:** 0.04 (A slightly positive value, but close to neutral)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -3.9% (Short-term bearish momentum)

The negative price change and RSI below 35 suggest the stock could be potentially undervalued or experiencing a temporary downturn. However, the significantly negative "Expected Return" needs further investigation before drawing any conclusions.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 0.9  | $5.03 B      |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.89 | $5.06 B      |
| 2024-04-26 | 0.83 | $5.07 B      |
| 2023-10-27 | 0.86 | $4.92 B      |
| 2024-10-25 | 0.86 | $4.92 B      |


Revenue has remained relatively stable around $5 billion, while EPS shows minor fluctuations.  There seems to be a duplicate entry for October 25, 2024.  This requires clarification or correction to properly analyze the trend.


**5) Financial Information:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |

| 2024-03-31 | $0.23B | 296.96% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.61B | 117.90% |

Equity and ROE show significant fluctuations. The extremely high ROE values in some quarters (e.g., 594.31%) require further investigation to understand the underlying factors contributing to these numbers.  They might indicate accounting peculiarities or unusual circumstances that need to be considered.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) shows a mixed picture. While it enjoys high profit margins and relatively stable revenue, its stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. Short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend. The high volatility in ROE and the extremely high (and possibly erroneous) expected return figure raise concerns and require further investigation into the company's financial reporting.  A more thorough analysis, including examination of the source data, is crucial before making investment decisions.  The reported -4827% expected return is almost certainly a data error and should be disregarded.  The erratic ROE values also need further explanation.  Further fundamental and technical analysis is necessary to determine the future prospects of the stock.
