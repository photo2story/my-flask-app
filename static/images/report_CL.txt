**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or market outlook information was provided within the prompt.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive has underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. Recent price action suggests a weakening trend.  Technical indicators are neutral, with weak momentum. Earnings show relatively stable but slightly declining revenue and EPS, while financial data (equity, ROE) shows high volatility which needs more context to properly interpret.  Without additional news, analyst opinions, and a clearer understanding of the volatility in equity and ROE, a comprehensive conclusion is difficult. The projected zero percent outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term warrants careful consideration before investment.  The dramatic fluctuations in the financial data call for a thorough investigation into the company's underlying circumstances.
