Given the underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the volatile financial metrics, and the lack of positive signals from technical indicators,  a cautious approach is warranted.  Further due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.   The inconsistencies in the data provided necessitate a thorough review of Colgate-Palmolive's financial statements and additional research into recent news and analyst reports.  The unusually high and low ROE figures require investigation to understand the underlying causes.
