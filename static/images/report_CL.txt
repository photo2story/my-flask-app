## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:** Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL), a leading consumer goods company, shows a cumulative return significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period considered.  While recent earnings and revenue remain relatively stable, the company's performance is below the market benchmark, warranting a closer look at its underlying factors and future prospects.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is a multinational consumer goods company focused on oral hygiene, personal care, and pet nutrition products.

* **Cumulative Return:** CL: 41.13%, VOO: 76.18%
* **Return Difference:** CL underperformed VOO by 35.05 percentage points.  This places it at the 42.5th percentile of its historical range of underperformance relative to VOO (ranging from -66.8% to 7.8%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results.  While the Alpha (excess return compared to the market) is positive in several periods, indicating periods of outperformance, it is also negative in some years.  The Beta consistently hovers around 0.5, suggesting lower volatility than the overall market.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally increased over time.  However, this data alone is insufficient to conclude its future performance. Further examination of macro-economic factors and sector-specific trends is needed.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $95.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $94.45
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $92.48
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $90.58

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. The significant price increase of $2.72 from the previous close indicates a potential short-term uptrend, but longer-term analysis is needed.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 56.33 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.2875 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +5.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -50.2%  This suggests a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a 2+ year horizon. This requires careful consideration and warrants investigation into the reasons for this projected underperformance.  Is this an accurate prediction?  What factors contribute to it?

The significant daily price change ($2.72) indicates a short-term upward surge, which needs confirmation from further price action before concluding a sustained uptrend.
