## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:** Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) is a consumer staples company that manufactures and sells oral hygiene, personal care, and home care products globally.  While exhibiting strong profitability,  its recent performance lags significantly behind the S&P 500, showing a considerable underperformance.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes and future prospects.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) shows a cumulative return of 33.25% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 119.91%. This represents a significant underperformance of -86.7%, placing it at the 1st percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 (based on provided max/min range).


The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results. While Alpha (excess return relative to the market) shows some periods of outperformance (particularly 2018-2020 and 2019-2021), Beta (market sensitivity) fluctuates, indicating varying levels of market correlation over time.  The consistently high equity value makes the ROI very high, but also raises questions about accuracy. The significant swings in ROE (Return on Equity) raise concerns about the financial stability of the company.

|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 13.0% | 4.6% | -15.0% | 51.9 |
| 2016-2018  | -12.0% | 8.5% | -30.0% | 41.9 |

| 2019-2021  | 32.0% | 7.3% | -39.0% | 64.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $86.70
* **Previous Close:** $90.89
* **Change:** -$4.19 (a 4.6% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $89.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.18
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $91.28

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The significant one-day drop warrants further investigation into potential market-moving events.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.97 (Slightly above neutral; not significantly overbought or oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.34 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, although relatively weak)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +0.4 (Short-term upward trend)

The negative expected return of -4742.5% is highly improbable and likely an error in the provided data.  The large price drop needs further context to determine if itâ€™s a temporary correction or the start of a larger downward trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue, but slight EPS decline in the last quarter.  There's no discernible major trend in either revenue or EPS.  The duplication of the 2024-10-25 entry should be clarified.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue      |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 0.9 | $5.03 B       |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.89 | $5.06 B       |
| 2024-04-26 | 0.83 | $5.07 B       |
| 2023-10-27 | 0.86 | $4.92 B       |
| 2024-10-25 | 0.86 | $4.92 B       | *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively consistent, with slight decreases in recent quarters. Profit margins show a consistent slight decline.  The Capital and Profitability section presents highly volatile and concerning data, especially the massive negative ROE in 2023-09-30. This requires further investigation and potentially clarification.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $5.03B | 61.08% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE       |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.43B | 169.43%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.12B | 594.31%  |

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Colgate-Palmolive's recent performance significantly underperforms the S&P 500. While it demonstrates stable revenue and generally high profit margins,  the volatility in ROE and the recent price drop raise serious concerns.  The provided data contains inconsistencies (duplicate earnings data, highly improbable expected return) that need clarification before a more definitive assessment can be made.  A deeper dive into the company's financials, competitive landscape, and any recent news affecting its performance is crucial for a comprehensive analysis. The provided data suggests the need for caution before investing.  Further investigation into the erratic ROE figures and the highly negative expected return is essential.
