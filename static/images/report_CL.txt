| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2016-2018  | -12.0% | 8.5% | -30.0% | 41.9 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $85.96
* **Previous Close:** $86.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $86.30
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $90.75

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price drop of -$0.92 from the previous close is a noteworthy decrease but does not itself indicate a significant event.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 42.61 (approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.14 (negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.9% (indicates a recent short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -4749.8% (This extremely negative value requires further investigation as it seems unrealistic and likely indicates a flaw in the calculation or data source. This should be explored in detail for accuracy)

The low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum, corroborated by the negative relative divergence.  The extremely negative expected return needs clarification before any interpretation can be made.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-25 | $0.9 | $5.03B        |
| 2024-07-26 | $0.89 | $5.06B        |
| 2024-04-26 | $0.83 | $5.07B        |
| 2023-10-27 | $0.86 | $4.92B        |
| 2024-10-25 | $0.86 | $4.92B        | *(There appears to be a duplicate entry here)*


Earnings have shown modest growth and relatively stable revenue over the past quarters.  However, the apparent duplicate data entry needs correction before a reliable analysis can be performed.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $5.03B | 61.08% |
| 2024-06-30 | $5.06B | 60.62% |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.07B | 60.00% |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.95B | 59.60% |
| 2023-09-30 | $4.92B | 58.54% |

Revenue has remained relatively stable, with slight fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high and show a slight downward trend.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.43B | 169.43% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.12B | 594.31% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.23B | 296.96% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.61B | 117.90% |
| 2023-09-30 | $-0.01B | -7866.67% |


The ROE is highly volatile and shows an extreme negative value in one quarter (-7866.67%), needing further investigation to understand the underlying cause. The equity figures also demonstrate considerable variation.  This instability warrants careful scrutiny of the financial statements.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While recent earnings show stability in revenue, the highly volatile ROE and the unexplained extremely negative expected return raise serious concerns.  The technical indicators suggest bearish momentum in the short term.  Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to investigate the reasons for the extreme values in the ROE and expected return, correct the duplicate earnings data, and conduct a thorough review of the company's financial statements to understand the current financial health and outlook.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity, so broader market conditions will heavily influence the stock's future performance.
