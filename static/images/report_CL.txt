* **5-Day Moving Average:** $93.32

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO (-0.09):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.7, indicating a recent improvement in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0%.  This suggests that based on the provided data, there is no expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.  The significant underperformance to date warrants further investigation.  This 0.0% figure is likely a reflection of the current underperformance and does not necessarily predict future performance.  The 93.44 closing price is not significantly high enough to suggest a sudden price jump.
