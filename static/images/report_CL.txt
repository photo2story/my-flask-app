## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) is a leading consumer goods company specializing in oral hygiene, personal care, and home care products.  This report analyzes its recent performance against the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

* **CL Cumulative Return:** 43.01%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 89.44%
* **Return Difference:** -46.4%  (CL underperformed VOO significantly)
* **Relative Divergence:** 32.2% (This indicates CL's underperformance is relatively low compared to its historical range of underperformance against VOO.)


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO):  Positive Alpha values in some periods suggest outperformance, while negative values indicate underperformance. Beta values generally hover around 1, implying similar volatility to the market, although some periods show higher than market volatility.  Capitalization remains relatively stable around $60B.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $93.90
* **Last Market Price:** $92.92 (down $1.04 from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $93.13
* **20-day Moving Average:** $92.09
* **60-day Moving Average:** $89.52

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent minor price decline.  It is also above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term upward trend.  The recent decline of $1.04 warrants attention but doesn't necessarily signal a significant shift in trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4382 (Low Risk)
* **RSI:** 63.75 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.23 (Positive; suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +11.9% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -78.5% (This extremely negative expected return needs further clarification regarding its calculation methodology and underlying assumptions, as it seems unrealistic for a stable company like CL over a two-year horizon).

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $4.95B     | 60.30%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $5.03B     | 61.08%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $5.06B     | 60.62%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $5.07B     | 60.00%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $4.95B     | 59.60%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE           |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.21B     | 348.58%       |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.43B     | 169.43%       |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.12B     | 594.31%       |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.23B     | 296.96%       |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.61B     | 117.90%       |

Both revenue and profit margins remain relatively stable and high.  However, the ROE figures exhibit extreme volatility and require further investigation to ensure accuracy.  Such high ROE figures are unusual and may indicate accounting issues or data errors that need to be checked.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive exhibits stable revenue and generally healthy profit margins. However, its stock performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the measured period. The provided expected return of -78.5% is highly suspect and requires clarification.  The extreme volatility in ROE figures also demands further scrutiny of the financial data. While short-term technical indicators suggest some bullish momentum, the long-term underperformance relative to the market is a significant concern.  Further investigation into the provided data, particularly the ROE and the expected return calculation, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Consider reviewing the data sources and accounting practices to ensure data reliability.
