| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2024-10-25 | $0.9   | $5.03B         |
| 2024-07-26 | $0.89  | $5.06B         |

There is a slight upward trend in EPS and relatively stable revenue, indicating a consistent but not significantly growing performance.  Note the duplicated entry for October 25th, 2024. This requires clarification.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, with slight fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high (around 60%), indicating strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity and ROE show significant volatility quarter-to-quarter.  The extremely high ROE values in several quarters (e.g., 594.31%) warrant further investigation to understand the underlying drivers.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive has shown consistent profitability but underperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  High risk indicators (MRI) and a negative expected return (-69.9%) suggest caution.  While recent earnings show stability, the high volatility in ROE and the negative PPO signal potential downside risk. The current price is below its moving averages, also pointing to short-term bearish momentum.  Further investigation is needed to understand the dramatic fluctuations in ROE and the duplicated earnings data points.  Given the current data and analysis, a long-term investment in CL appears risky compared to the S&P 500, unless significant mitigating factors (not present in this data) are identified.
