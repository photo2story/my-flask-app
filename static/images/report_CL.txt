*   **Expected Return:** -1692.3%

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests low market risk. The RSI is below 50, indicating that the stock might be approaching an oversold condition. The negative PPO reinforces the downward trend. The hybrid signal suggests a cautious approach, recommending a significant reduction in holdings and increasing cash reserves.  The *extremely* negative expected return is highly unusual and warrants further scrutiny. This could be an error in the data or reflect a very pessimistic outlook based on the specific model used. Recent increase means that there is still momentum.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
| :--------- | :--------- | :-------------- |
| 2025-06-30 | \$5.11B    | 60.06%          |
| 2025-03-31 | \$4.91B    | 60.82%          |
| 2024-12-31 | \$4.95B    | 60.30%          |
| 2024-09-30 | \$5.03B    | 61.08%          |
| 2024-06-30 | \$5.06B    | 60.62%          |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE       |
| :--------- | :--------- | :-------- |
| 2025-06-30 | \$0.70B    | 105.84%   |
| 2025-03-31 | \$0.36B    | 190.08%   |
| 2024-12-31 | \$0.21B    | 348.58%   |
| 2024-09-30 | \$0.43B    | 169.43%   |
| 2024-06-30 | \$0.12B    | 594.31%   |

**Analysis:**  Revenue is relatively stable. Profit margins are consistently high, indicating strong operational efficiency. The Return on Equity (ROE) is very high but shows significant fluctuation, likely influenced by the changes in Equity. The high ROE values need careful interpretation, as they could be inflated by lower equity values in certain periods.

**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is currently underperforming the S&P 500, with negative Alpha suggesting risk-adjusted underperformance. Recent price action indicates a potential short-term downward trend, and the hybrid signal recommends reducing holdings.  While the MRI indicates low market risk, the *extremely* negative expected return is concerning. Revenue and profit margins are stable, but the fluctuating ROE and recent volatility noted in the news require further investigation.

**Recommendation:**  Due to the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the concerningly negative expected return, and the cautious hybrid signal, a conservative approach is warranted.  Further research is needed to understand the reasons behind the negative expected return and the recent news events. I would suggest holding off on new investments and carefully monitoring existing positions until a clearer picture emerges.
