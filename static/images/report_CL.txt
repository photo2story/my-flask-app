## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) is a multinational consumer goods company specializing in oral hygiene, personal care, and household products.

The cumulative return of CL is 43.13%, significantly lower than the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 120.91%.  The difference is -77.8%, placing it at the 2.5th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates CL has underperformed the S&P 500 considerably over the analyzed period.  The provided alpha values (around 0.2) suggest consistent outperformance relative to the market, but the low CAGR and large negative MDD values across multiple periods indicate high risk associated with this outperformance.  The fluctuating Beta suggests sensitivity to broader market movements, but with periods of both higher and lower sensitivity.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $93.32

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.02 (Slightly below the oversold level of 30, suggesting potential for a bounce but still in bearish territory.)
* **PPO:** -0.09 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Recent Relative Divergence (20-day):** +0.7 (Short-term upward movement.)

The current price of $93.44 is below the recent moving averages, indicating no recent rapid upward or downward movement.  Given the negative PPO and the below-average RSI, a significant price rebound would not necessarily be expected immediately.
