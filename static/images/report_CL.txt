## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) is a consumer goods company manufacturing and selling oral hygiene, personal care, and pet products globally.

The cumulative return of CL is 35.55%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 118.37%.  The difference is -82.8%, placing it at the 1.1 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data. This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows a consistently low beta (around 0.2) across the years, indicating low correlation with the overall market. Alpha is also consistently positive, suggesting that CL has outperformed the market in some periods, though overall performance falls below market benchmarks.  However, it's crucial to note that these figures are CAGR, not representative of total return for the analyzed period.  The high variability in CAGR year-over-year requires further investigation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $88.69
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $87.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $89.86
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $92.83

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The relatively small gap between the 5-day and 20-day averages might suggest some consolidation before a more decisive directional move.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (28.9):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound. However, it should be considered in context with other indicators.
* **PPO (0.02):** A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, although quite weak.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -2.8% indicates a recent weakening in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-4295.5%):** This extremely negative figure warrants immediate scrutiny.  Such a significant negative return is highly improbable and likely reflects an error in the calculation or data input.  It should be recalculated and verified. There is no mention of a calculation method. The provided -4295.5% expected return for an assumed 2+ year investment is completely unfeasible and should not be considered.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-10-25 | $0.90   | $5.03B       |
| 2024-07-26 | $0.89   | $5.06B       |
| 2024-04-26 | $0.83   | $5.07B       |
| 2023-10-27 | $0.86   | $4.92B       |
| 2024-10-25 | $0.86   | $4.92B       | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*


Earnings have been relatively stable, with slight fluctuations.  The duplicate entry needs correction to avoid misinterpretations.  Revenue is relatively consistent, suggesting a stable business performance despite the underperforming stock price. A more thorough analysis would require comparison to previous years and industry benchmarks.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $5.03B | 61.08%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $5.06B | 60.62%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.07B | 60.00%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.95B | 59.60%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $4.92B | 58.54%       |

Revenue remains relatively stable, while profit margins show a slight downward trend in recent quarters, but are still very high.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity  | ROE           |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.43B | 169.43%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.12B | 594.31%      |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.23B | 296.96%      |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.61B | 117.90%      |
| 2023-09-30 | -$0.01B| -7866.67%     |

ROE is highly volatile and the negative ROE figure in 2023-09-30 is a significant red flag requiring further investigation and clarification.  This could indicate accounting irregularities or other issues and needs immediate attention.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive's stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  While revenue is stable and profit margins remain high, concerns arise from the volatile ROE, the dubious -4295.5% projected return,  and the need for clarification on the negative ROE figure in Q3 2023. The company shows some positive signs, but the overall picture is complicated by data inconsistencies and needs further investigation before making any investment decisions.  The oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook hinges on resolving the discrepancies in the provided financial data and understanding the reasons behind the significant underperformance relative to the market.  Additional data, industry comparisons, and a thorough review of the company's financial statements are crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
