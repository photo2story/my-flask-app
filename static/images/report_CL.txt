Further investigation into the reasons for the volatile ROE and the persistently negative alpha is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated data entry in the earnings report needs to be corrected.  A more in-depth analysis, including a review of the company's strategy and competitive landscape, is necessary for a comprehensive assessment.
