* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.72

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.57 (Below 30 indicates oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.04 (Positive, but very close to zero, suggesting weak momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Divergence:** -3.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -4827.0% (This extremely negative value is likely an error in the data provided.  It needs clarification.)

The low RSI suggests the stock may be oversold, potentially indicating a short-term bounce.  However, the weak PPO and negative relative strength divergence point towards continued downward pressure.  The erroneous expected return figure requires further investigation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue        |
|------------|-------|----------------|

Earnings have been relatively stable over the last few quarters, with slight fluctuations in both EPS and revenue.  The duplicate entry for October 25, 2024 needs clarification. Further analysis requires more complete and consistent financial data.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis. This crucial information is needed to assess the company's profitability and overall financial health.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive's significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, coupled with mixed alpha/beta results, warrants careful consideration.  While the low RSI suggests potential for a short-term rebound, the weak PPO and negative recent relative strength divergence indicate ongoing downward pressure.  The lack of key financial data (Total Revenue, Gross Profit, and clarification on the vastly negative Expected Return) significantly hinders a complete assessment.  Before making any investment decisions, more comprehensive financial data and a deeper understanding of the negative expected return are required.  The current data suggests a cautious outlook.
