## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) is a multinational consumer goods company that manufactures and sells oral hygiene products, personal care products, and household cleaning supplies.

The cumulative return of CL is 39.69%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 121.09%.  The difference is -81.4%, placing it at the 6.6th percentile of its historical range of divergence (-87.7% to 8.2%). This indicates CL's underperformance relative to the broader market. The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance over time, with periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. The Beta fluctuates, suggesting varying levels of market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $90.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $89.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $91.38

The closing price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance at this level.  The recent price increase of $1.47 (from $89.57) represents a small but positive development.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.14  (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.61 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Relative Strength (20-day):**  6.6 (+), indicating short-term outperformance relative to the previous period.

The recent price increase (1.47)  is modest, and doesn't signal a significant *rapid upswing*.  The extremely negative expected return of -660.5% is likely an error in the data provided.  It is not realistic for a large-cap, established company like Colgate-Palmolive to have such a negative expected return over a long-term horizon. The expected return needs further clarification or correction.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |

| 2024-10-25 | $0.86 | $4.92 Billion | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*

Earnings show relatively stable revenue around $5 billion, with slight fluctuations. EPS shows a moderate upward trend. The duplicate entry for October 25th needs to be investigated and clarified.

| 2023-09-30 | -$0.01B  | -7866.67%     |

ROE shows significant volatility, with some extremely high and one extremely negative value (requiring further investigation).  The negative equity figure also needs clarification.  Inconsistencies in this data warrant careful scrutiny and potentially further investigation into the accounting practices of the company.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive shows stable revenue and high profit margins, indicating a fundamentally strong business. However, its stock performance significantly lags behind the S&P 500.  While recent price action suggests short-term upward momentum, the negative expected return (-660.5%, likely an error) and volatile ROE figures raise significant concerns.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry, extreme ROE values, negative equity) require thorough investigation and clarification before making any investment decisions.  The high RSI suggests potential for a short-term correction. Further due diligence is crucial before considering any investment in CL.
