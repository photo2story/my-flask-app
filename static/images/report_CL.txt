| 2023-2025  | 1.0% | 70.6% | -49.0% | 0.3 | 71.7 |

**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:** The consistently negative or low alpha values indicate that CL has generally underperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis, except for the 2020-2022 period. The recent 2023-2025 period shows a significantly negative alpha, indicating substantial underperformance.
*   **Beta:** The low beta values (generally below 1) suggest that CL's price is less volatile than the overall market. This could be attractive to risk-averse investors, but it also means CL is less likely to benefit as much from market rallies.
*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows the average annual growth rate over the specified periods. The recent CAGR of 1.0% for 2023-2025 is very low, reflecting weak growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. The relatively high MDD values, especially in recent years, suggest significant volatility and potential for losses.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization in billions provides a sense of the company's size, which has remained relatively stable over the years.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **20-day Moving Average:** 89.65
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 90.28

**Analysis:** The stock price has slightly decreased in the last session. The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downward trend.  The fact that the recent change is negative and that the price has broken below the 5-day moving average underscores the weakness.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators

*   **RSI:** 27.84 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.14

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.9 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3560.1

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The low MRI suggests the overall market risk is relatively low at the moment.
*   **RSI:** The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, which *could* suggest a potential for a rebound, but in the context of other indicators, it might just mean the stock is weak.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO indicates the price is below its moving average, confirming the downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The signal to sell a significant portion of holdings (70% cash position) is a strong bearish indicator, suggesting a lack of confidence in near-term performance.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The short-term increase in relative divergence *might* indicate a slight improvement relative to the benchmark, but it's happening within a context of overall significant underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** The very low expected return indicates a negative outlook for long-term investment compared to the S&P 500.

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE        |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------- |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.36B  | 190.08%    |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.21B  | 348.58%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** While the profit margin remains strong (around 60%), the revenue is decreasing over the observed quarters, reinforcing the trend seen in the earnings analysis.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows variability.  ROE (Return on Equity) is extremely high, but this likely results from the very low equity values. Such high ROE values might not be sustainable or reflect genuine profitability.

### 7. Overall Summary

*   **Weak Revenue Growth:** Revenue has been declining in recent quarters, raising concerns about the company's top-line growth.
*   **Strong Profit Margins:** Despite declining revenue, profit margins remain relatively high, suggesting strong cost management or pricing power.
*   **High ROE (with Caution):** ROE is exceptionally high, but this might be artificially inflated by low equity values and may not be sustainable.
*   **Bearish Technical Indicators:** Technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest the stock is currently in a downward trend and potentially oversold. The hybrid signal recommends selling a significant portion of holdings.
*   **Recent News and Volatility:** Recent news suggests significant events impacting the company, leading to increased stock volatility.

The recommendation from the Hybrid Signal to significantly reduce holdings aligns with the overall negative assessment.
