**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information on recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions is provided.  This section requires additional external research.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) is currently underperforming the S&P 500, showing a significant negative divergence. While technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term rebound (oversold RSI), the long-term outlook is uncertain, particularly given the volatility and negative outlier in the ROE.  The consistent positive alpha suggests some degree of management skill in creating returns in excess of market risk, however this is overshadowed by the large underperformance against the market.  The flat revenue and slightly declining profit margin trends warrant attention.  Further investigation into the significant volatility in capital and profitability, the cause of the negative ROE, along with a comprehensive news and analyst sentiment analysis, are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The absence of current market outlook and analyst opinions limits the scope of this analysis.
