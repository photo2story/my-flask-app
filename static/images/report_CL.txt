The significant recent news and volatility further emphasize the need for careful monitoring. The negative relative divergence, combined with a very negative expected return, indicates potential challenges in outperforming the market in the long term. However, the company maintains strong revenue and high profit margins, which are positive indicators. The fluctuation in equity and high ROE also require careful review.
