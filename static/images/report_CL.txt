## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Analysis Report

**0) Overview:** Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) is a consumer staples company that manufactures and sells oral hygiene products, personal care products, and household cleaning products globally.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive's cumulative return (33.25%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 119.91%. The difference is -86.7%, placing it at the 1.0 percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 (based on a range of -87.7% to 8.2%).

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (S&P 500). While alpha (excess return relative to the market) is positive in several periods, it fluctuates significantly, and beta (market sensitivity) varies as well, suggesting exposure to market risk changes over time. Market capitalization also fluctuates throughout the period.  The high and inconsistent ROE values  (5. Financial Information) also suggests significant year-to-year volatility.  Further investigation of this would be warranted.

**2) Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $86.70
* **Previous Close:** $90.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $89.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.18
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $91.28

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent significant price drop (-4.61) indicates a notable negative shift.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.97 (Slightly above neutral; not indicating strong overbought or oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** 0.34 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum, though weak)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +0.4 (Short-term upward trend)

The large negative expected return (-4742.5%) is unrealistic and likely an error in the provided data.  A long-term investment (2+ years) could potentially outperform the S&P 500 if the company's fundamentals improve and market sentiment shifts positively, although the current data does not clearly suggest that this is highly likely.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings and revenue show slight variability, but generally remain stable.  There is no significant trend apparent from this small sample. More data would be needed for a more robust analysis.

|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 0.9 | $5.03B      |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.89 | $5.06B      |

| 2024-10-25 | 0.86 | $4.92B      |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable, but profit margins show a slight downward trend.  The equity and ROE figures are highly volatile, indicating significant uncertainty and possibly errors in the data.  This should be further investigated.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Colgate-Palmolive has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period. While recent earnings remain relatively stable, the provided financial data shows significant volatility, particularly in ROE and equity figures, which need further examination.  The negative price movement and indicators suggest a possible downward trend. Given the inconsistent performance and questionable financial data, further investigation is needed before making any investment decisions.  The provided expected return is inaccurate and should be disregarded.  A more detailed analysis of the financial statements and further contextual information is required for a more comprehensive and reliable assessment.
