## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL), a leading global consumer products company specializing in oral hygiene, personal care, and home care products.  We will examine its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key financial indicators, and recent earnings.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500:**

Colgate-Palmolive's cumulative return (37.22%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (118.31%) over the measured period. The difference is -81.1%, placing it at the 9.1st percentile of its historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (max: 8.2%, min: -90.0%). This indicates a substantial lag compared to the broader market.

Alpha and Beta analysis reveals mixed results across different periods, showing periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (Beta > 1 indicates higher volatility than the market). Notably, Alpha is positive in some periods, suggesting periods of outperformance above the market's benchmark returns.  However, the consistently lower cumulative return highlights the persistent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2018-2020  | 21.0% | 8.5% | -6.0% | 0.7 | 62.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 32.0% | 7.3% | -39.0% | 1.0 | 64.1 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $89.47
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $87.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $90.07

The closing price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance at higher levels.  The price increase from the previous close (1.82%) suggests a recent positive momentum.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 61.53  (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.37 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +7.1% (Indicates recent upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -463.3% (This extremely negative figure likely reflects the significant underperformance already observed and should be treated with caution. It's not a precise prediction of future performance.)

The positive PPO and RSI suggest a bullish trend, but the significantly negative expected return reflects the substantial underperformance against the S&P 500.

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue around $5B, but EPS has shown slight fluctuation. There's a potential downward trend in EPS in recent quarters. More data is needed for a thorough analysis.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive has shown consistent revenue but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent price movements and some technical indicators suggest potential short-term upward momentum, the long-term underperformance and the highly volatile ROE raise concerns. The extremely negative predicted long-term return relative to the S&P 500 underscores the need for further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance before making any investment decisions.  A deeper dive into the drivers of ROE volatility and a comparison of CL's performance against its competitors within the consumer staples sector is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
