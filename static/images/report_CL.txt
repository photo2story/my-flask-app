However, the beta varies over the periods indicating changing volatility relative to the market. The significant negative CAGR (-12%) in 2016-2018 and high MDDs (maximum drawdown) in several periods show volatility and risk.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $94.54

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 34.6 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.  However, it needs to be considered in conjunction with other indicators and factors.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.088 –  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -0.5 –  Short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – The provided expected return of 0% indicates no significant excess return is anticipated compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), given the current context.

Given the current price of $93.49 is below the moving averages, there's no indication of a sudden price surge. The RSI suggesting oversold conditions could lead to a slight rebound, but the negative PPO and downward trends in moving averages and relative divergence suggest a more prolonged period of low performance is possible.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period presented.

The financial statements highlight high volatility and unusual values in certain metrics, requiring further scrutiny.

More information is needed about market sentiment, recent news, and deeper investigation into the reported financials to give a more definitive outlook.   The lack of information about earnings expectations makes a definitive judgment difficult.
