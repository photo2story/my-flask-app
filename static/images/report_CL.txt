**5. Financial Information:**

No "Total Revenue" or "Gross Profit" data were available. This lack of crucial financial data severely limits the depth of the analysis. Further financial statement information is required for a thorough evaluation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some periods showed positive alpha, the overall trend is negative.  Technical indicators (RSI) suggest oversold conditions, and the price is below its moving averages, hinting at a potential short-term bounce. However, the dramatically negative expected return (-4827%) raises strong doubts about data integrity.  The lack of crucial financial data (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) severely restricts the ability to make informed conclusions.  A thorough review of the data sources is crucial, addressing the discrepancies identified before drawing any strong conclusions about the investment potential of Colgate-Palmolive.  More robust financial data and clarification of the expected return calculation are essential for a reliable assessment.
