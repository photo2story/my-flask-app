## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) is a consumer goods company that manufactures and sells oral hygiene products, personal care products, and household cleaning products.

The cumulative return of CL (35.55%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (118.37%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -82.8%, placing it at the 1.1 percentile of the historical divergence range (-83.8% to 8.2%). This indicates CL underperformed VOO considerably.

The provided CAGR data shows inconsistent performance, ranging from -7% to 41% across different periods.  The relatively low beta (around 0.2) suggests CL is less volatile than the overall market, consistent with its defensive characteristics.  However, the positive alpha (around 0.2) in most periods indicates that CL has historically generated returns above what would be expected based on its beta alone.  The relatively high Maximum Drawdowns (MDDs) point to periods of significant losses.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $88.69
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $87.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $89.86
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $92.83

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The price recently increased slightly ($0.13) from the previous close, a minor positive shift.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (28.9):**  Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (0.02):**  Indicates a slight positive momentum, but close to neutral.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-2.8):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend.

The significant negative expected return of -4295.5% is highly unrealistic and likely reflects an error in the calculation.  It shouldn't be interpreted as a literal prediction.  The provided data likely lacks necessary components for a reliable long-term return prediction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data reveals relatively stable revenue around $5 billion per quarter, with minor fluctuations. EPS shows a slight upward trend, but growth is not substantial.  Note that the October 25th, 2024 data is duplicated.  Further analysis requires more historical data to establish trends.


| Date       | EPS | Revenue      |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| 2024-10-25 | $0.9 | $5.03B       |
| 2024-07-26 | $0.89| $5.06B       |
| 2024-04-26 | $0.83| $5.07B       |
| 2023-10-27 | $0.86| $4.92B       |
| 2023-10-25 | $0.86| $4.92B       |


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue remains relatively stable but shows a slight declining trend. Profit margins are high and consistent but also show a slightly downward trend over time.  The equity and ROE data is highly volatile and contains outliers (e.g., the extremely negative ROE in Q3 2023). This volatility warrants further investigation to understand the underlying causes.  More historical data is needed for a comprehensive assessment.


| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity | ROE       |
|-------------|----------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| 2024-09-30  | $5.03B  | 61.08%        | $0.43B  | 169.43%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $5.06B  | 60.62%        | $0.12B  | 594.31%   |
| 2024-03-31  | $5.07B  | 60.00%        | $0.23B  | 296.96%   |
| 2023-12-31  | $4.95B  | 59.60%        | $0.61B  | 117.90%   |
| 2023-09-30  | $4.92B  | 58.54%        | -$0.01B | -7866.67% |


**7. Overall Conclusion:**

CL has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. While it displays some positive characteristics like a low beta and periods of positive alpha, the recent price action shows a downtrend. The relatively stable revenue and high profit margins offer some support, but the volatility in equity and ROE figures raise concerns.  The provided data, particularly the expected return, is flawed and unreliable for making long-term investment decisions. Further analysis with a more comprehensive dataset is crucial for a robust assessment of CL's future prospects.  The -4295.5% expected return must be disregarded as erroneous.  More complete financial statements and industry analysis are needed before a sound investment opinion can be reached.
