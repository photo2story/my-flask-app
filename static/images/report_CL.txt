## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) is a leading consumer goods company specializing in oral hygiene, personal care, and home care products.  The company shows significant divergence from the S&P 500's performance over the analyzed period.  While exhibiting periods of strong growth, recent performance lags behind the broader market.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive's cumulative return (38.34%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (112.87%) over the measured period.  The reported divergence is -74.5%, placing it at the 15.8th percentile of historical divergence (relative to the minimum and maximum divergence observed).

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows fluctuating performance relative to the market (Beta) and varying levels of outperformance (Alpha) over different periods.  While periods of strong Alpha (e.g., 2019-2021) indicate periods of outperformance, others show underperformance.  The significant variation in Alpha and Beta suggests a degree of inconsistency in market behavior. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) remains relatively stable within a range.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $90.2
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $90.45
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $89.76

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend. However, it is above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend in the medium to longer term.  The recent small positive price change (0.03) does not indicate a significant shift.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 65.01  (Slightly above the 70 overbought threshold)
* **PPO:** 0.62 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +13.1% (Indicates short-term upward trend)

The RSI suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory, potentially indicating a short-term correction might be likely. The positive PPO confirms the upward momentum.  The short-term relative divergence increase suggests a positive recent trend.  The dramatically negative expected return of -241.6%  compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a significant concern and requires further investigation.  This extremely negative forecast should be considered critically and its validity verified against other models and market analyses.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue        |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2024-10-25 | $0.9 | $5.03 Billion  |
| 2024-07-26 | $0.89 | $5.06 Billion  |
| 2024-04-26 | $0.83 | $5.07 Billion  |
| 2023-10-27 | $0.86 | $4.92 Billion  |
| 2024-10-25 | $0.86 | $4.92 Billion  | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Earnings show relatively stable revenue around $5 billion, with slight fluctuations. EPS also shows minor variations, indicating consistent but not significantly growing profitability.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, with profit margins consistently high (above 60%). This suggests strong pricing power and efficiency.

**Capital and Profitability:**  ROE shows significant volatility, with exceptionally high values in some quarters (potentially due to accounting factors or one-time events). Further investigation is needed to interpret these fluctuations fully.  The equity figure also fluctuates considerably.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive shows consistent revenue and profitability but underperforms the S&P 500 considerably in terms of total returns.  While short-term indicators show positive momentum, long-term projections are deeply negative relative to the market.   Technical indicators suggest near-term overbought conditions. The significant variability in ROE and the highly negative long-term return prediction warrant further investigation into the underlying factors driving these results.  The data suggests a need for cautious evaluation before investing, potentially favoring a more diversified portfolio approach rather than significant CL allocation.  Further due diligence is required to confirm the accuracy and understand the implications of the provided data, especially concerning the dramatically negative long-term return projection and the high fluctuations in ROE and equity.
