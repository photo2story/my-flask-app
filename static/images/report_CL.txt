**7. Overall Summary**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) shows a mixed picture. While analysts have a generally positive view ("Buy" consensus), recent price action is negative, and the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Recent news reflects some analyst concern about price targets. While revenue and profit margins are stable, the high ROE is due to low value of equity. The most concerning factor is the highly negative projected long-term return, suggesting significant potential downside. Based on the recent RSI approaching oversold, it might be good buying opportunity. However, you have to consider the high MDD, and the recent expected return.
