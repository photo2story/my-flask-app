**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $87.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $86.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $90.69

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The recent price increase (from $85.96 to $87.37) is modest, indicating relatively low volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 49.44 -  Close to neutral territory, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** -0.0362 - Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.6 - Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.

The relatively small price change and indicators suggest a period of consolidation, not a sharp upward or downward move. The negative expected return of -1485.1% is extremely concerning and needs further investigation.  It likely reflects the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 projection.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500, showing consistent negative alpha. While revenue and profit margins are relatively stable, the substantial underperformance, combined with volatile ROE and equity figures, raises significant concerns.  The highly negative projected return (-1485.1%) warrants a thorough examination of the underlying assumptions.   Before considering a long-term investment, further investigation into the causes of the significant underperformance and the anomalies in the ROE and equity data is crucial.  Additional due diligence including a review of the company's strategic direction and competitive landscape is recommended.
