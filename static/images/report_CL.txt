## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) is a multinational consumer goods company that manufactures and sells oral hygiene, personal care, and home care products.  Over the period analyzed, CL's cumulative return (50.34%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 130.06%.  The difference is a -79.7 percentage point underperformance. The relative divergence places CL in the 7.3rd percentile compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $96.63 (Last Market: $97.01)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $96.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $93.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $98.58

The closing price is slightly below the 5-day and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend.  However, it's above the 20-day moving average, indicating some short-term support.  The $97.01 last market price is only slightly above the closing price.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (71.73):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.80):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (NaN):**  The lack of data prevents a clear interpretation.  The notation of a short-term decline is noted but is only relevant if the data used to calculate the 20-day divergence was also negative.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The model predicts no significant excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) based on the current data.  This is concerning given the historical underperformance already observed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a relatively stable revenue stream around $5 billion per quarter, with minor fluctuations. EPS has remained relatively consistent, slightly decreasing from Q2 to Q3 2024 before a slight uptick in Q4 2024.  There are no notable beats or misses versus expectations, as these values were not included in the provided data. More context is required to evaluate trends conclusively.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively flat in recent quarters, showing minor decreases. Profit margins have generally decreased slightly over the past year.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity and ROE show significant volatility.  The extremely high and negative ROE figures (594.31% and -7866.67%) in Q2 and Q3 2023, respectively, suggest potential accounting adjustments or unusual events that warrant further investigation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent market outlook data was provided.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing.  This critical context limits the scope of the analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent earnings show stability in revenue and relatively consistent EPS, the financial information reveals some volatility in equity and exceptionally high and low ROE figures that require further investigation to determine validity. Technical indicators suggest a potentially overbought market and a recent downward price trend. Without access to more recent news, analyst opinions, and a complete explanation for the drastic ROE fluctuations, a comprehensive recommendation is impossible. The low expected return further strengthens concerns surrounding CL's future prospects against the market.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the underperformance against the S&P 500, inconsistent financial metrics, and lack of crucial external data, further investigation is strongly recommended before any investment decisions are made. The provided data suggests a cautious approach.  Analyzing the reasons for the unusual ROE figures and incorporating additional market information is vital for a more informed assessment.
