**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values over the years. Alpha represents the excess return compared to the benchmark, and beta measures the volatility relative to the market.  High beta implies higher volatility.  While alpha shows periods of outperformance (e.g., 2018-2020, 2019-2021), negative CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)  is evident in certain periods, indicating underperformance.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) also fluctuated during the observed years.  Note that without the specific benchmark used to calculate alpha, the interpretation needs to be cautious.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 13.0% | 4.6% | -15.0% | 52.2 |
| 2016-2018  | -12.0% | 8.5% | -30.0% | 42.1 |
| 2017-2019  | 9.0% | 8.5% | -21.0% | 50.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 21.0% | 8.5% | -6.0% | 63.6 |
| 2019-2021  | 32.0% | 7.3% | 1.0 | 64.9 |
| 2020-2022  | 7.0% | 9.3% | 1.0 | 61.4 |
| 2021-2023  | 3.0% | 9.3% | 1.0 | 63.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 13.0% | 9.3% | 1.0 | 74.2 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $86.70
* **Last Market Price:** $87.11
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $89.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.18
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $91.28

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend. The recent slight increase (from $86.70 to $87.11) is not enough to definitively confirm a trend reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.97 (Slightly above the neutral 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** 0.34 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum, although a low value.)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +0.4 (Short-term upward trend in relative divergence.)
* **Expected Return:** -4742.5% (This extremely negative value needs further clarification and likely represents an error in the provided data. It is impossible to have this degree of negative return. This requires correction/verification)

The small price increase is not a significant upward movement (not a rapid rebound). The extremely negative expected return is nonsensical and should be investigated.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue around $5 billion per quarter.  EPS is also relatively stable, showing only slight fluctuations. There's no clear upward or downward trend immediately apparent in this data.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue      |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 0.9 | $5.03 B      |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.89 | $5.06 B      |
| 2024-04-26 | 0.83 | $5.07 B      |
| 2023-10-27 | 0.86 | $4.92 B      |
| 2024-10-25 | 0.86 | $4.92 B      | *(Duplicate entry?)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable over the past year, but profit margins have shown a slight downward trend.  The equity and ROE (Return on Equity) figures are highly volatile and contain an outlier of -7866.67% ROE in 2023-09-30, requiring further investigation to understand the reason for such a significant negative ROE.


| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $5.03B | 61.08% |
| 2024-06-30 | $5.06B | 60.62% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While revenue and EPS show stability, the highly erratic ROE figures and the nonsensical negative expected return raise serious concerns. The price is currently below its moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend.  Further investigation is required to understand the highly volatile equity and ROE data, the drastically negative expected return and ascertain the reliability of the provided data, before forming a conclusive investment opinion.  The unusually high and low ROE values might require an examination of the accounting methods used and possibly an adjustment of the data to arrive at meaningful numbers.
