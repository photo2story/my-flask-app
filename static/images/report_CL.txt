## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) is a multinational consumer goods company that manufactures and sells oral hygiene, personal care, and household products.

The cumulative return for CL is 35.06%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 122.16%.  The difference is -87.1%, placing it at the 6th percentile of historical divergence (relative divergence of 0.6) between CL and the S&P 500. This indicates CL's performance has consistently lagged behind the market over the observed period.

The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance, with some periods of outperformance and others of significant underperformance relative to the market.  The relatively low alpha consistently around 0.1 further supports the underperformance against the market.  Beta values fluctuate between approximately 0.4 and 0.7, suggesting moderate sensitivity to overall market movements.  However, consistent underperformance outweighs this factor.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $87.88
* **5-day Moving Average:** $87.95
* **20-day Moving Average:** $88.56
* **60-day Moving Average:** $91.64

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The small negative daily change (-$0.03) is not significant enough to indicate a sharp drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.04 - This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound, but not a guarantee.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.22 - A positive value suggests bullish momentum, but the magnitude is relatively small.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -2.4 - This indicates a recent downward trend in the stock's relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** -4765.5% - This extremely negative expected return is highly unrealistic and likely an error in the provided data.  It should be reviewed and corrected.  A reasonable analysis of long-term expected return would require a more sophisticated model considering various factors beyond the historical performance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows relatively stable revenue around $5 Billion, with slight fluctuations. EPS shows a similar trend.  However, the repetition of the 2024-10-25 data point needs to be corrected for accurate analysis.  Further investigation into the discrepancy is needed.  A more detailed analysis requires a longer time series and comparison with industry peers.


| Date       | EPS | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 0.9 | 5.03          |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.89 | 5.06          |
| 2024-04-26 | 0.83 | 5.07          |
| 2023-10-27 | 0.86 | 4.92          |
| **2024-10-25** | **0.86** | **4.92**          | *Duplicate Data Point*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information shows relatively stable revenue but significant volatility in profitability metrics, particularly ROE.  The extremely negative ROE in 2023-09-30 warrants further investigation.  The high and fluctuating ROE values across quarters suggest potential issues with the data provided.  Accuracy needs to be verified and additional contextual information (e.g., accounting practices) should be considered before drawing any conclusions.

| Quarter    | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE (%)    |
|------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| 2024-09-30 | 5.03          | 61.08%        | 0.43         | 169.43%    |
| 2024-06-30 | 5.06          | 60.62%        | 0.12         | 594.31%    |
| 2024-03-31 | 5.07          | 60.00%        | 0.23         | 296.96%    |
| 2023-12-31 | 4.95          | 59.60%        | 0.61         | 117.90%    |
| 2023-09-30 | 4.92          | 58.54%        | -0.01        | -7866.67% | *Highly unusual*


**7. Overall Summary:**

Colgate-Palmolive (CL) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While some technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term rebound, the long-term outlook requires further investigation due to inconsistencies and anomalies in the provided financial data.  The provided expected return is clearly erroneous and should be disregarded.  A thorough review of the data quality and a more comprehensive analysis incorporating a broader range of factors (including industry comparisons, macroeconomic conditions, and competitor analysis) are crucial before forming any investment recommendations.  The unusual volatility in the ROE figures strongly suggests the need for further scrutiny of the financial data.
