## Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL) Stock Report

This report analyzes Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL), a leading consumer goods company producing and selling oral hygiene products, personal care items, and pet nutrition globally.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive's cumulative return (31.41%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.63%. The provided data shows a large divergence of -89.2%, placing it at the 0.0 percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market. While exhibiting periods of positive alpha (outperformance), particularly between 2018-2021, it also shows negative CAGR and high negative Alpha in several periods.  The beta fluctuates, suggesting varying levels of market sensitivity. Notably, the market capitalization (Cap(B)) generally increased over the period.  This indicates that despite periods of underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the company has experienced overall growth.  More detailed analysis is needed beyond this limited historical data to understand the drivers of this inconsistent performance.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $85.68
* **Last Market Price:** $86.30 (increase of $0.72)
* **5-day moving average:** $86.51
* **20-day moving average:** $87.79
* **60-day moving average:** $90.93

The current price is below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase is a short-term move and doesn't necessarily negate the larger trend.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 41.27 (Below 50, suggesting bearish sentiment)
* **PPO:** -0.14 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -6.6% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -4819.0% (This extremely negative value needs further clarification.  It is likely an error and should be reviewed for accuracy.  The extremely negative value suggests significant risk, which should be carefully considered in investment decisions.)

The recent price increase of $0.72, while notable, is not significant enough to be considered a sharp rebound. The technical indicators reinforce the bearish outlook suggested by the price action. The extremely low expected return necessitates a review of the calculation method.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS | Revenue      |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| 2024-10-25 | 0.9 | $5.03B       |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.89 | $5.06B       |
| 2024-04-26 | 0.83 | $5.07B       |
| 2023-10-27 | 0.86 | $4.92B       |
| 2024-10-25 | 0.86 | $4.92B       |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for October 25th, 2024.  Assuming the second entry is incorrect, revenue has remained relatively stable, around $5 billion, with minor fluctuations. EPS shows a slight increase in recent quarters. However, more detailed analysis is needed to determine the drivers of these changes and their significance.  Further scrutiny of revenue and cost structure is important to fully understand profitability trends.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $5.03B | 61.08% |
| 2024-06-30 | $5.06B | 60.62% |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.07B | 60.00% |
| 2023-12-31 | $4.95B | 59.60% |
| 2023-09-30 | $4.92B | 58.54% |

Profit margins are high and relatively stable, showing a slight downward trend.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.43B | 169.43% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.12B | 594.31% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.23B | 296.96% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.61B | 117.90% |
| 2023-09-30 | $-0.01B | -7866.67% |

ROE is highly volatile and the -7866.67% figure for 2023-09-30 requires investigation as it's unrealistic. This extreme fluctuation in equity and ROE warrants further examination of the underlying accounting practices and financial health of the company.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Colgate-Palmolive's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the observed period, with substantial negative alpha in several periods. While revenue and profit margins remain relatively stable and high, the considerable volatility in ROE and the presence of an outlier in the equity data raise concerns about the company's financial health. The technical indicators and recent price action suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough investigation of the data discrepancies (especially the extremely negative expected return and ROE outlier) and a deeper dive into the financial statements and industry trends is strongly advised. The highly volatile ROE and the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 raise serious questions about the long-term prospects and justify further research.  Long-term investment should only be considered after a full review of these issues.
