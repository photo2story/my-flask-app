* **60-day Moving Average:** $91.63 

The stock price is currently slightly above its 5-day moving average and 20-day moving average, indicating short-term upward momentum. However, the 60-day moving average suggests potential for a larger downward trend in the longer term.

**5. News & Recent Issues:**

The recent market outlook for WEC remains relatively neutral. WEC's commitment to sustainable energy initiatives has been a positive factor driving investor confidence. However, the company's earnings growth has been relatively slow, and its dependence on regulated utilities exposes it to regulatory risks. Analyst opinions are mixed, with some highlighting WEC's strong dividend yield and reliable cash flow, while others point to the company's limited growth prospects and potential vulnerability to interest rate hikes. 

**6. Summary:**

WEC has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, with limited growth potential and a bearish short-term outlook based on technical indicators. The company's consistent earnings performance and focus on sustainable energy initiatives are positives, but these need to translate to more robust growth and potentially higher returns. Despite a strong dividend yield and stable cash flow, WEC's exposure to regulatory risks and limited growth prospects present significant challenges for investors. Further investigation into specific earnings guidance and future growth strategies is crucial to assess WEC's long-term viability.

**7. Conclusion:**

Based on the current data and analysis, WEC appears to be a stable but potentially undervalued company with limited growth prospects. While its consistent earnings and dividend yield are attractive to investors seeking reliable income, its underperformance against the S&P 500 and its exposure to regulatory risks suggest that WEC may not be an ideal investment for those seeking high growth and outperformance. Further investigation into the company's growth strategy and future earnings guidance is recommended before making any investment decisions.
