* **20-Day Moving Average:** $90.54
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $83.93

The stock price is currently above all moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend. However, the relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates a possible lack of strong momentum.

* **Expected Return:** 48.47% (Maximum 5-year expected return on current investment)

The RSI indicates an overbought condition, while the PPO suggests a slight negative momentum. The declining relative divergence also signals a possible short-term bearish trend. However, the high expected return suggests potential growth in the long term.

| Date | EPS | Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| 2021-02-25 | 0.76 | 1.93 B$ |

| 2020-02-27 | 0.77 | 1.95 B$ |

The most recent earnings data is not available, and therefore cannot be analyzed against expectations. However, the historical data suggests a generally stable revenue stream with moderate growth.

**5. Conclusion:**

WEC currently shows a mix of positive and negative signals. While the stock is trading above its moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, the overbought RSI, declining relative divergence and slightly negative PPO suggest caution. The historical data indicates a stable revenue stream with moderate growth, but further analysis of the most recent earnings performance is required to assess the current outlook. The high expected return suggests potential long-term growth, but investors should be aware of the short-term risks indicated by technical indicators. 

**6. Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, a wait-and-see approach is recommended. Monitoring the stock's price action and upcoming earnings reports will be crucial to determine a more definitive investment strategy. Investors with a longer-term horizon may find the high expected return attractive, but they should be aware of the short-term risks.
