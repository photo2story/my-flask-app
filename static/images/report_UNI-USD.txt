**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -80.0%  | 87.8%  | -119.0%  | -0.1   | 0.0    |
| 2020-2022  | 300.0%  | 87.8%  | 300.0%   | -0.1   | 0.0    |

| 2022-2024  | 8663.0%  | 95.8%  | 8642.0%  | -0.1   | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 6278.0%  | 95.8%  | 6255.0%  | 0.2    | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is extremely high in recent periods (2021-2025), indicating significant growth but also extreme volatility. The initial period (2019-2021) shows a significant loss.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, around 87.8% to 95.8%, meaning that Uniswap experiences large drops in value from peak to trough. This underlines the risk associated with the asset.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is also exceptionally high, closely mirroring the CAGR, which suggests strong outperformance relative to a benchmark (likely the market).
*   **Beta:** Beta values are very low, close to zero, suggesting very little correlation with the broader market (S&P 500). This is unusual and could indicate that Uniswap's price movements are driven more by factors specific to the cryptocurrency market or the Uniswap protocol itself rather than broader economic trends.
*   **Cap(B):**  Capitalization is 0.0 for all years.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 0.00016264

*   **5-day SMA:** 0.0002
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.0002
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.0002

**Analysis:** The close price and moving averages are all very close, suggesting a period of relative stability in Uniswap's price over the recent short-term.

**3. RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 45.09 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.25 (Potentially bullish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (88521190 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (Indicates a short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 427721.5%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests moderate risk and potential.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 45 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which can be a bullish sign.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The signal is to buy heavily into Uniswap, and it claims this is "safe" due to the moderate MRI.
*   **Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence suggests recent underperformance compared to its historical relationship with the comparison asset (S&P 500).
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return should be viewed with extreme caution. It suggests a very optimistic outlook but is likely based on the recent high growth rates, which are unlikely to be sustainable.

    *   Uniswap Explodes Above $8.40 As Fee Switch Proposal Ignites Record DeFi Rally

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Uniswap (UNI-USD) has demonstrated extraordinarily high growth in recent years, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this growth has come with substantial volatility, as evidenced by the high Maximum Drawdown figures. The low Beta suggests that Uniswap's price movements are largely independent of the broader market.

Recent news presents a mixed picture. Positive headlines indicate renewed strength and optimism surrounding protocol changes (fee switch proposal). Conversely, news of institutional investors selling off holdings indicates a possible tempering of sentiment.

**Recommendations:**
*   **High Risk:** Given the high volatility (MDD) and the speculative nature of cryptocurrency markets, investing in Uniswap is considered a high-risk investment.
*   **Due Diligence:** Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to do thorough research, consider your risk tolerance, and consult with a financial advisor. The data provided is limited and backward-looking. It is important to be aware of the risks involved and not rely solely on the information provided.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Sustainability:**  The extremely high growth rates of recent years are unlikely to be sustainable indefinitely.
*   **Regulation:** Cryptocurrency markets are subject to evolving regulatory landscapes, which could significantly impact the value of Uniswap.
*   **Competition:** The DeFi space is highly competitive, and Uniswap faces competition from other decentralized exchanges.
