| 2023-2025  | 223.0% | 97.2%  | 200.0% | -0.1 | 0.0 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Volatile performance across different periods, with substantial growth in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024.  Negative CAGR in earlier periods indicates significant losses.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD values (90.8% to 100%) point to substantial risk and price volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Extremely high positive alpha in some periods (especially 2021-2023 and 2022-2024) suggests significant outperformance relative to a benchmark, but negative alpha in earlier periods indicates underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to 0 suggest a very low correlation with the broader market (S&P 500). This implies that UNI-USD's price movements are largely independent of the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization data is missing.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **5-day Moving Average:** 0.0002
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 0.0002
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 0.0002

**Analysis:**  The current price is unchanged from the previous close. The price is slightly below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a potential short-term downtrend or consolidation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5985 (High Risk)
*   **RSI:** 45.09 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.25 (Neutral)

*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** 0.0 (Negative Trend)
*   **Expected Return:** 1004346.3%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The "High Risk" MRI indicates that the asset is considered risky based on the market environment.
*   **RSI & PPO:**  The RSI is near the 50 level, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. PPO hovering slightly above 0 indicates a weak uptrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is highly risk-averse, recommending a significant reduction in holdings and a high cash position.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** A negative value suggests a recent underperformance of UNI-USD compared to its benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return should be viewed with caution. It is not a reliable predictor of future performance, especially given the high volatility of the asset.
*   **Price Action:**  The current price and previous close being the same suggests a lack of immediate price momentum or volatility.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **General Market Sentiment:** The news headlines (Fed, Citigroup, etc.) are broadly related to the overall market and financial landscape.
*   **Alibaba Stock Surges:**  Alibaba's surge could indicate broader positive sentiment towards tech and AI-related assets, which *could* indirectly influence crypto markets.

**5. Overall Assessment and Recommendation**

Uniswap (UNI-USD) has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over certain periods, but with extremely high volatility and risk.  The technical indicators suggest a neutral-to-slightly-bearish short-term outlook.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **High Risk:** The high MRI and MDD values highlight the significant risk associated with UNI-USD.
*   **Volatility:** The volatile CAGR and MDD underscore the potential for large price swings.
*   **Market Dependence:** The low beta suggests that UNI-USD's performance is relatively independent of the broader market, but general market sentiment can still have an impact.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The risk-averse hybrid signal indicates caution is warranted.

**Recommendation:** Given the high risk, high volatility, and the hybrid signal recommending a significant reduction in holdings, a cautious approach is advised. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions. The astronomical "expected return" should not be the primary driver of investment decisions.
