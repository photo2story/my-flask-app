2025-12-13 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the Uniswap (UNI-USD) analysis, covering the provided data points.

**0) Report & Analysis**

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** UNI-USD
*   **Company:** Uniswap (A decentralized cryptocurrency exchange protocol.)
*   **Uniswap Cumulative Return:** 7223.50%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 35.07%
*   **Divergence:** 7188.4
*   **Relative Divergence:** 2.4

*   **Analysis:** Uniswap significantly outperformed the S&P 500. The cumulative return is vastly higher. The divergence of 7188.4 shows the absolute difference in return. The relative divergence of 2.4 suggests the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range, which might indicate potential for further upside compared to its past performance *relative* to the S&P 500. However, this relative metric is very sensitive to past volatility and should be interpreted with caution.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -80.0%   | 87.8% | -119.0%  | -0.1  | 0.0    |
| 2020-2022  | 300.0%   | 87.8% | 300.0%   | -0.1  | 0.0    |
| 2021-2023  | 15014.0% | 95.8% | 15013.0% | -0.1  | 0.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 8663.0%  | 95.8% | 8642.0%  | -0.1  | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 6278.0%  | 95.8% | 6255.0%  | 0.2   | 0.0    |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR figures are exceptionally high, indicating periods of rapid growth. However, it's crucial to remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future returns.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is also very high, pointing to significant volatility and potential for substantial losses during downturns.  This suggests high risk.
    *   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are exceptionally high, indicating significant outperformance *relative* to the market benchmark (presumably the S&P 500, though it should be explicitly stated).  However, high alpha can also indicate higher risk.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is consistently close to zero, which is peculiar given the high returns and volatility. This *could* indicate that UNI-USD's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market.  A Beta close to zero may be wrong. There may be a problem with the data source.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization figures are not helpful as the Cap(B) is 0.0. There may be a problem with the data source.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 0.0001626
*   **Last-Market:** {'price': 0.0001626, 'previousClose': 0.0001626, 'change': 0.0}
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.0002
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.0002
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.0002

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently at 0.0001626. The 5, 20, and 60-day SMAs are all the same (0.0002), indicating a period of relatively stable, though low, prices in the very recent past.  The `change` being 0.0 suggests that at the very end of the timeframe, the price was unchanged. These figures are extremely low, and may not match the actual performance of Uniswap's UNI token.  This is likely due to data errors, so they should be treated with extreme caution.

**3) Indicators Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.09
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.25
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (88521190 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-) 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 427721.5
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A value of 0.8 suggests a medium level of risk and a moderate investment recommendation.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 45.09 is considered neutral. It doesn't indicate that the asset is overbought or oversold.
    *   **PPO:**  A PPO of 0.25 suggests that the shorter-term moving average is slightly above the longer-term moving average, hinting at a possible, but very weak, upward trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends a significant buy.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change suggests a short-term downward trend in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   **Expected Return:** The expected return is extremely high and very likely unrealistic. This also needs data verification.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes:** The news headlines point to several key themes:
    *   **DeFi Rally & Fee Switch Proposal:** Positive news related to Uniswap's governance and potential increased value capture through fee switches.
    *   **Bitcoin & Crypto Market Movements:** General market sentiment and price fluctuations in Bitcoin influence crypto-related stocks, including Uniswap.
    *   **Tokenization:**  The broad trend of tokenization is seen as a significant growth driver for the crypto space.
    *   **Commercial Paper Issuance:** News regarding Uni-Fuels completing a commercial paper issuance suggests activity in related or adjacent sectors.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Uniswap (UNI-USD) has demonstrated exceptionally high historical returns and alpha, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this comes with substantial volatility, as evidenced by the high maximum drawdown. The extremely high expected return is suspicious and should be independently verified.

The recent news events are a mixed bag. Positive developments like the fee switch proposal and general DeFi bullishness are counteracted by broader market volatility tied to Bitcoin price swings. The tokenization narrative provides a long-term positive outlook for the crypto space.

**Crucially:** The provided data contains inconsistencies and anomalies. The low price data, the potentially inaccurate Beta values, the extreme Expected Returns, and the Market Cap are all concerning.  A thorough verification of the data source is *essential* before making any investment decisions.
