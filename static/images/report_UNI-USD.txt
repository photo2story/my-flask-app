2026-01-01 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down this Uniswap (UNI-USD) analysis based on the information provided.

**0. Report Start**

**1. Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** UNI-USD (Uniswap)
*   **Company Overview:** Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange protocol.
*   **UNI Cumulative Return:** 7223.5%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 35.1%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 7188.4
    *   Relative Divergence: 2.4

*   **Analysis:** Uniswap has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 by a significant margin during the analyzed period. The current divergence is 7188.4 points.  The very low relative divergence of 2.4 suggests the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range, which should be interpreted with caution because the historical range in this case is enormous. This does *not* mean Uniswap is only slightly superior. It means *relative to its wildly fluctuating past*, the current divergence isn't that extreme compared to the potential range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | 7223.0% | 95.8% | 7190.0%  | -0.1  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Extremely high at 7223.0%.  This indicates exceptional growth over the analyzed period (2024-2026).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Very high at 95.8%. This signifies a significant potential loss from peak to trough.  This reinforces the inherent high risk associated with this investment.
*   **Alpha:** Exceptionally high at 7190.0%. This implies a large degree of outperformance compared to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500), even *after* accounting for risk. This also underscores how volatile it is and the high degree of excess return obtained.
*   **Beta:**  -0.1. A negative beta *suggests* the price moves in the opposite direction of the market (S&P 500).  However, with such a small value (-0.1), the correlation is extremely weak. It's essentially uncorrelated. A high degree of excess return with a low correlation to the market means the price is driven by company specific events.
*   **Cap(B):** 0.0. This likely represents the company's market capitalization in Billions, but the value of 0.0 suggests it's either very small (micro-cap or nano-cap) or the data is incomplete. Uniswap is decentralized so this makes sense that it is zero.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 0.0001626423036213
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 0.0001626423, 'previousClose': 0.0001626423, 'change': 0.0}
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.0002
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.0002
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.0002

*   **Analysis:** The price has not moved in the most recent session. The 5, 20, and 60-day simple moving averages are all essentially the same (0.0002). This implies that the price has been relatively stable in the short to medium term *at this price level*. It means the price has been at this value for a brief moment.

**3. RSI, PPO, Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence, Expected_Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 45.09
*   **PPO:** 0.25
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (88521190 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-04-17)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 427721.5%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI of 0.8:** Indicates medium risk, suggesting a cautious approach.
    *   **RSI of 45.09:** Suggests the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. It's in a neutral zone.
    *   **PPO of 0.25:** The Positive Price Oscillator being slightly positive may indicate that the shorter-term moving average is a little above the longer term which may indicate the beginning of a potential uptrend, although the value is fairly small.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal suggests a strong buy recommendation based on the current analysis, allocating a large portion of capital to the asset.  This conflicts with the high MDD, caution is still warranted.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** No change in the last 20 days suggests recent market trends have not been that meaningful.
    *   **Expected Return of 427721.5%:** This is an *extremely* high, almost unbelievable, projected return. This should be regarded with extreme skepticism. If possible, the methodology behind this projection should be investigated.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Key Headlines and Links:** (See original prompt for URLs) The news flow is a mix of price predictions, analysis of fee switch proposals, reports of institutional selling, and overall market commentary related to Bitcoin and crypto stocks. The news is primarily from 2025.

*   **Analysis of News:** The news is mixed. Positive catalysts like the "Fee Switch Proposal" driving a DeFi rally are offset by reports of institutional investors selling off holdings. This volatility is typical of the cryptocurrency market. The news cycle reflects the high risk and speculation surrounding Uniswap and cryptocurrencies in general.

*   **Summary:** Uniswap (UNI-USD) has exhibited extraordinary returns compared to the S&P 500.  Its CAGR and Alpha are extremely high, but so is its Maximum Drawdown, signaling a very high-risk investment.

The data requires careful consideration of risk tolerance and a thorough understanding of the cryptocurrency market.  Given the high MDD, investors must be prepared for potentially substantial losses.
