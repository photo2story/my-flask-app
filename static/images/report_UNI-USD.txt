|------------|---------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -80.0%  | 87.8%  | -119.0%  | -0.1   | 0.0    |
| 2020-2022  | 300.0%  | 87.8%  | 300.0%   | -0.1   | 0.0    |

| 2022-2024  | 8663.0% | 95.8%  | 8642.0%  | -0.1   | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:** Compounded Annual Growth Rate.  Shows very high growth over different periods, but past negative.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown. High MDD values indicate significant potential losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:**  Measures the investment's performance relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500).  Extremely high positive alpha suggests the investment has significantly outperformed its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Measures the investment's volatility relative to the market.  A beta near zero suggests low correlation with the market, but there has been a change.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in Billions. It is $0, so it is probably calculated wrong.
*   **Analysis:**  The data shows periods of tremendous growth (high CAGR, high Alpha) but also significant risk (high MDD).  The low and even negative Beta suggests that UNI's price movement is not closely tied to the broader market.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Uniswap (UNI-USD) has demonstrated exceptional historical returns, far surpassing the S&P 500.  The Alpha/Beta analysis highlights its high growth potential but also the significant risk involved, as indicated by the high MDD values. The very large, but stable SMAs show there has been less volatility recently. The recent news flow is mixed, with positive developments regarding governance and price levels offset by institutional selling and uncertain price predictions.  The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk, and the Hybrid Signal indicates a strong buy signal, but a recent short-term divergence decline has occurred.  The extremely high expected return should be treated with considerable caution.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Volatility:** Despite recent price stability, cryptocurrency investments are inherently volatile.
*   **Regulation:** The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, which could impact Uniswap.
*   **Competition:** The decentralized exchange (DEX) space is becoming increasingly competitive.
*   **Model-Driven Expectations:**  Be very wary of relying heavily on the provided expected return, especially given its magnitude.  These are often based on specific model assumptions that may not hold true.
*   **Limited Information:** This analysis is based solely on the data provided.  A more comprehensive analysis would require a deeper dive into Uniswap's fundamentals, technology, team, and the overall crypto market.
