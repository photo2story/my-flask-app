**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha      | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|------------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | 300.0%   | 100.0%   | 301.0%     | 0.1   | 0.0    |
| 2021-2023  | 15014.0% | 100.0%   | 15013.0%   | 2.8   | 0.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 8663.0%  | 100.0%   | 8643.0%    | 3.1   | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Extremely high, especially in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024, showing rapid growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 100% in all periods, indicating very high risk and potential for complete loss during these timeframes.
*   **Alpha:** Very high, suggesting significant outperformance compared to a benchmark (likely the market), but this could be due to the high-risk nature of the asset.
*   **Beta:** Low in 2020-2022 (0.1) but increases significantly in subsequent periods (2.8, 3.1). This indicates that Uniswap's price movements have become increasingly correlated with the overall market and suggests higher volatility.
*   **Cap(B):** 0.0, which suggests a very small company size.

**Analysis:**

*   The data suggests that UNI-USD's historical returns have been exceptional, but come with substantial risk, as reflected in the MDD and the increasing Beta.
*   High Alpha could mean the asset manager has added much value, but with very small Cap this is more likely to be attributed to luck, especially during a crypto boom. The high Alpha could be due to factors not captured by the benchmark.
*   The increasing Beta suggests that UNI-USD is increasingly influenced by overall market trends.

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** A negative divergence change over the past 20 days suggests a short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (427822.4%) should be interpreted with extreme caution. It is unlikely to be sustainable and could be a result of extrapolating from a period of exceptional growth.  This value should be viewed as highly speculative.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Uniswap (UNI-USD) has historically delivered extraordinarily high returns compared to the S&P 500 but is accompanied by massive risk, as evidenced by the 100% MDD and increasing Beta.  The asset has become increasingly correlated with the overall market. Recent price action has been relatively stable, and the MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. A significant discrepancy exists as the Hybrid Signal strongly recommends buying, potentially suggesting a lack of integration between different analysis models. The extremely high expected return should be taken with a grain of salt.  Recent news highlights price predictions, positive developments related to fee structures, but also institutional selling and market corrections, which should be taken into account. Overall, Uniswap presents a high-risk, high-reward investment profile. The data indicates high price volatility. Consider the current flat trend and do further analysis before investing.
