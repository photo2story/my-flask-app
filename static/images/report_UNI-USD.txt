*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate varies wildly, ranging from -80% to over 15000%, indicating high volatility and potentially speculative growth phases.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high (87.8% to 95.8%), signaling significant risk and price declines during the observed periods.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is extremely high and positive in most periods, suggesting that Uniswap's returns significantly exceed what would be expected based on market movements alone.  However, the negative alpha in 2019-2021 suggests underperformance during that period.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are very low, close to zero, indicating very little correlation with the broader market (S&P 500). This suggests that Uniswap's price movements are largely independent of overall market trends.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization data not available.

**5. Overall Analysis**

Uniswap (UNI-USD) has demonstrated significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 based on the data provided. However, these returns have been accompanied by substantial volatility and risk, as evidenced by the high Maximum Drawdown figures.

The RSI and PPO values are neutral, while the Hybrid Signal suggests a buying opportunity.

The most important caveat is that the provided "Expected Return" figure (427721.5%) appears to be inaccurate and should be disregarded.
