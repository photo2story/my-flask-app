*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha/beta analysis is unusual and needs context.  The beta values close to 0 suggests little correlation with the market. The high alpha values indicate significant excess returns compared to the benchmark, but the negative alpha in 2019-2021 implies underperformance during that period.

**5. Overall Summary**

Uniswap (UNI-USD) has delivered extremely high returns compared to the S&P 500. However, the negative Beta coefficients, high MDD, and high alpha need further context for decentralized tokens.
Recent price action appears stable, with moving averages converging. Technical indicators are mixed (RSI neutral, slight uptrend in PPO).
