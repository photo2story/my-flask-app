**0. Report Summary**

*   **Uniswap (UNI-USD):** A decentralized cryptocurrency exchange protocol.
*   **High Past Returns, Volatile:** UNI has delivered significant returns compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), but with substantial volatility.
*   **Recent Price Action:**  Price is stable around $0.00016, with SMAs indicating minimal recent movement.
*   **Market Sentiment:**  Medium investment recommended (MRI of 0.8), potential buy signal (Hybrid Signal), and high expected returns suggest optimism, though tempered by past volatility.

**1. Return Rate Comparison (UNI-USD vs. VOO)**

*   **Uniswap Company Overview:** Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange protocol facilitating automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.
*   **UNI Cumulative Return:** 7223.5%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 35.1%
*   **Divergence:** 7188.4 (Relative Divergence: 2.4)

**Analysis:** UNI has massively outperformed the S&P 500.  The divergence of 7188.4 indicates a substantial difference in cumulative returns. The Relative Divergence of 2.4 suggests that the current return difference is near the minimum relative to the historical fluctuations of the stock.

**Alpha, Beta analysis**

|            | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -80.0%   | 87.8%  | -119.0%  | -0.1   | 0.0    |
| 2020-2022  | 300.0%   | 87.8%  | 300.0%   | -0.1   | 0.0    |
| 2021-2023  | 15014.0% | 95.8%  | 15013.0% | -0.1   | 0.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 8663.0%  | 95.8%  | 8642.0%  | -0.1   | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 6278.0%  | 95.8%  | 6255.0%  | 0.2    | 0.0    |

**Analysis:** The Alpha, Beta analysis data underscores the high-risk, high-reward nature of UNI.  The extremely high CAGRs and Alphas indicate substantial excess returns compared to a benchmark, but the equally high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) reveal significant potential for loss. The Betas generally close to 0 suggest that UNI's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500).
