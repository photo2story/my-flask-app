2025-12-06 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Uniswap (UNI-USD) based on the provided data.

**0) Report Structure:**

First, I will present the data in a simple, numerical format. Then, I will follow with an analysis of each point and an overall summary.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** UNI-USD
*   **Company Name:** Uniswap
*   **Overview:** Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to swap tokens without intermediaries.
*   **Cumulative Return (UNI-USD):** 7223.50%
*   **Cumulative Return (S&P 500 / VOO):** 35.07%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current:** 7188.4
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 2.4

**Analysis of Return Rate Comparison:**

The cumulative return of Uniswap significantly outperforms the S&P 500.  The relative divergence of 2.4 suggests the current divergence is near the minimum of its historical range.  This large outperformance needs to be viewed in context. Cryptocurrencies, especially smaller ones, are inherently more volatile than a broad market index like the S&P 500. Such high returns are usually accompanied by much higher risk.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD  | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|------|---------|------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -80.0%   | 87.8% | -119.0% | -0.1 | 0.0    |
| 2020-2022  | 300.0%   | 87.8% | 300.0%  | -0.1 | 0.0    |
| 2021-2023  | 15014.0% | 95.8% | 15013.0%| -0.1 | 0.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 8663.0%  | 95.8% | 8642.0% | -0.1 | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 6278.0%  | 95.8% | 6255.0% | 0.2  | 0.0    |

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is extremely high in the later periods (2021-2025), indicating rapid growth. However, the early period (2019-2021) shows a significant loss.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, around 87.8% to 95.8%, meaning the investment has experienced large declines from peak to trough. This is a critical risk factor.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are very high, indicating substantial outperformance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500), but in period 2019-2021 the Alpha is negative indicating underperformance.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values fluctuate close to zero, suggesting the price of UNI-USD has very little correlation with the overall market (S&P 500). A Beta of zero means that this stock tends to move independently of the index.
*   **Cap:** Cap = 0.0, indicating a very small amount.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 0.0001626
*   **Last-market:** price: 0.0001626, previousClose: 0.0001626, change: 0.0
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.0002
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.0002
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.0002

**Analysis of Price Fluctuations:**

The closing price, previous close, and the moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day) are nearly identical.  This indicates a period of price stability in the very short term. However, the very small absolute values suggest this is a high-risk/high-reward asset.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 45.09
*   **PPO:** 0.25
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (88521190 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (단기하락 - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 427721.5%

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.8 suggests medium investment risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 45.09 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.25 indicates the price is trending up.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying a large number of shares with a 0% cash position, suggesting a strong buy signal. This signal should be weighed carefully given the volatile nature of the asset.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decrease in relative divergence suggests a short-term downward trend relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (427721.5%) is unrealistic and likely a result of extrapolating past performance, which is not indicative of future results, especially with highly volatile assets.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Bitcoin News (Dec 5, 2025):** Bitcoin falling below $90K could negatively affect the broader cryptocurrency market, including Uniswap.
*   **Uniswap Reclaims $6.20 (Dec 4, 2025):**  Positive news suggesting a rebound in Uniswap's price.
*   **Aave Price News (Dec 4, 2025):**  News about Aave, another DeFi protocol, can provide a general sentiment of the DeFi market.
*   **Uni-Fuels Commercial Paper Issuance (July 21, 2025):**  While not directly related to Uniswap, this highlights the increasing adoption of blockchain for financial instruments.
*   **Uniswap Price Drops 40% (Feb 5, 2025):**  Indicates the potential for significant price drops, highlighting the risk involved.

**Analysis of News:**

The news highlights both the volatility and potential of Uniswap and the cryptocurrency market. The Bitcoin news, especially, is relevant, as a downturn in Bitcoin often drags down other cryptocurrencies.  The news about Uniswap reclaiming a price level is positive, but the earlier news of a 40% price drop serves as a reminder of the inherent risk.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   No analyst opinions were provided.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Uniswap (UNI-USD) has demonstrated exceptional historical returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this outperformance comes with very high risk, as evidenced by the high Maximum Drawdown values. The Beta suggests Uniswap's price movements are largely independent of the broader market. Recent news shows a mix of positive rebounds and potential negative pressures from Bitcoin's price fluctuations. The indicators present a mixed picture. The MRI suggests medium risk, the RSI is neutral, the PPO indicates a positive trend, and the hybrid signal is a strong buy. However, the expected return is unrealistically high, and recent divergence suggests a short-term downward trend.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in Uniswap is highly speculative. While the potential for high returns exists, the risk of significant losses is also very high. The investment recommendation would be highly dependent on the individual investor's risk tolerance and investment horizon. This investment requires close monitoring of the cryptocurrency market and a strong understanding of the underlying technology and economic factors driving the price.
