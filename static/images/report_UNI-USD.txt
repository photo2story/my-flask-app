A negative beta in this context might mean it performs *opposite* to the general market, which isn't necessarily *good* given the huge swings in performance.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Uniswap (UNI-USD) has delivered extraordinarily high returns compared to the S&P 500, as evidenced by the high cumulative return and divergence. However, this performance comes with significant volatility, as indicated by the high Maximum Drawdown. The recent price stability and a slight decline in relative divergence suggest a potential cooling-off period. The recent news highlights the sensitivity of UNI's price to protocol changes and broader cryptocurrency market trends, but also underscores the large downside impact when institutional investors sell-off large amounts of UNI holdings. Also, the existence of unrelated Uni-Fuels news may cause noise in the information and should be removed.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Uniswap offers high-risk, high-reward potential. Its returns have been exceptional, but the volatility is substantial. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance, the potential for large drawdowns, and the dependence of UNI's price on protocol changes and overall cryptocurrency market sentiment. Without analyst consensus information, it's difficult to provide a more informed perspective on future expectations.
