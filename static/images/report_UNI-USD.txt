2025-12-28 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down this analysis of UNI-USD (Uniswap) and provide a comprehensive report.

**0) Report Structure**

*   First, we present the raw data.
*   Then, we add analysis and interpretation.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** UNI-USD
*   **Company:** Uniswap - A decentralized exchange protocol built on Ethereum.
*   **UNI Cumulative Return:** 7223.5%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 35.1%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 7188.4
    *   Relative Divergence: 2.4

**Analysis:**

*   Uniswap has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). The cumulative return of UNI is vastly higher than that of VOO.
*   The "relative divergence" of 2.4 suggests that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range.  This *could* imply that UNI is relatively undervalued compared to its historical divergence with the S&P 500 or, more realistically, that the massive outperformance observed earlier is unsustainable and the divergence is reverting.  It's important to remember that "relative divergence" is based on a limited historical data range and its interpretation can be misleading without further context.
*   **Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta    | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -80.0%  | 87.8%  | -119.0% | -0.1    | 0.0    |
| 2020-2022  | 300.0% | 87.8% | 300.0% | -0.1    | 0.0    |
| 2021-2023  | 15014.0% | 95.8% | 15013.0% | -0.1    | 0.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 8663.0% | 95.8% | 8642.0% | -0.1    | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 6278.0% | 95.8% | 6255.0% | 0.2     | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is extremely high in recent periods, highlighting periods of massive growth.  The initial negative CAGR from 2019-2021 likely reflects UNI's early price discovery and initial market volatility.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown figures are very high, indicating substantial risk and volatility associated with UNI. This means that investors experienced significant peak-to-trough declines during these periods.  This is typical of crypto assets.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are very large and positive, reflecting UNI's substantial outperformance relative to its benchmark (likely the S&P 500). This suggests Uniswap has generated significant excess returns.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are close to zero, especially in earlier periods. This *should* indicate that Uniswap's price movements are largely independent of the overall market (S&P 500).  However, given the significant outperformance and the nature of the crypto market, a beta near zero is probably misleading and should be interpreted with extreme caution.  It might be an artifact of the limited data or the choice of benchmark.  The Beta increase to 0.2 in the most recent period may indicate increasing correlation with the overall market.
*  **Cap:** Market Cap data is missing, but may be helpful for future analysis.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 0.00016264
*   **Last-market:** price: 0.00016264, previousClose: 0.00016264, change: 0.0
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.0002
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.0002
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.0002

**Analysis:**

*   The close price, previous close and 5, 20 and 60 day simple moving averages all appear to be the same. A lack of fluctuation suggests either stable market conditions or a problem with the data source.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 45.09
*   **PPO:** 0.25
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (88521190 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 427721.5
**Analysis:**

*   The MRI indicates a "Medium Investment Recommended" rating.
*   The RSI of 45.09 indicates a neutral market condition - neither overbought nor oversold.
*   PPO of 0.25 suggests the asset price is slightly trending up.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" recommends buying, but the extremely high number of shares is unrealistic. It indicates a strong bullish sentiment, but should be taken with a grain of salt.
*   The recent relative divergence change indicates a slight short-term decline, which is consistent with the previous relative divergence score.
*   The "Expected Return" is astronomically high and likely unrealistic. It may represent a potential upside based on some model, but should not be taken as a guarantee.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

Uniswap (UNI) has demonstrated exceptional historical returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this outperformance comes with substantial volatility and risk, as evidenced by the high Maximum Drawdown figures. The proposed fee switch is a major positive catalyst that appears to be driving investor interest. However, UNI is still susceptible to broader market trends in the crypto space and has experienced significant price corrections in the past. The technical indicators (RSI, PPO) are currently neutral to slightly bullish.

**Recommendations:**

*   The decision to invest in UNI should be based on a high risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon.
*   The proposed fee switch is a crucial factor to monitor. Successful implementation and adoption could lead to further price appreciation.
*   Given the high volatility, consider using techniques such as dollar-cost averaging to manage risk.
*   Be aware of the potential for significant price corrections and the impact of broader market trends on UNI.
