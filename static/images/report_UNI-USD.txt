    |------------|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
    | 2019-2021  | -80.0%    | 87.8% | -119.0%   | -0.1   | 0.0    |
    | 2020-2022  | 300.0%    | 87.8% | 300.0%    | -0.1   | 0.0    |
    | 2021-2023  | 15014.0%  | 95.8% | 15013.0%  | -0.1   | 0.0    |
    | 2022-2024  | 8663.0%   | 95.8% | 8642.0%   | -0.1   | 0.0    |
    | 2023-2025  | 6278.0%   | 95.8% | 6255.0%   | 0.2    | 0.0    |

    *   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate shows extremely high growth in recent periods (2021-2025).  Earlier periods (2019-2021) show significant losses.  This indicates high volatility and a recent surge in value.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently very high, indicating significant potential for losses. It has gradually increased from 87.8% to 95.8%.
    *   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are very high, suggesting a significant outperformance compared to the benchmark.  However, in the 2019-2021 period, a large negative Alpha indicates significant underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values are consistently near zero. This would normally suggest the security's returns are relatively independent of the overall market but the numbers are so low that their validity should be checked. It is important to note that a negative Beta indicates an inverse relationship between UNI-USD and the broader market.
    *   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization appears to be missing.

**Simple Analysis:** Uniswap has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but with extremely high volatility. The data suggests that Uniswap's growth is high, but so is the potential for losses. The high Alpha values mean it performs well independent of the market and the MDD values indicates high historical losses.
