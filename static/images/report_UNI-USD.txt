Okay, let's break down the provided data for Uniswap (UNI-USD) and provide a comprehensive analysis.

**1) Return Rate Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange protocol on the Ethereum blockchain, known for its automated market maker (AMM) system.

*   **Numbers:**
    *   Uniswap Cumulative Return: 7223.50%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 35.14%
    *   Divergence:
        *   Current: 7188.4
        *   Relative Divergence: 2.4 (This indicates that the current divergence is at the low end of its historical range).

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Outperformance:** Uniswap has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period.
    *   **Relative Divergence:** The low relative divergence value suggests that while Uniswap has seen significant returns, recently it may not be outperforming VOO to the same extent as it did in the past, at least relative to its historical divergence range. It's currently closer to the lower end of its divergence fluctuations.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis**

|            | CAGR      | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| 2019-2021  | -80.0%    | 87.8%  | -119.0% | -0.1 | 0.0    |
| 2020-2022  | 300.0%    | 87.8%  | 300.0%  | -0.1 | 0.0    |
| 2021-2023  | 15014.0%  | 95.8%  | 15012.0%| -0.1 | 0.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 8663.0%   | 95.8%  | 8642.0% | -0.1 | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 6278.0%   | 95.8%  | 6255.0% | 0.2  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR and MDD:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is exceptionally high in recent periods (2021-2025), but so is the Maximum Drawdown (MDD), indicating significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting that Uniswap has generated returns above and beyond what would be expected based on market movements.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are close to zero, indicating that Uniswap's price movements have historically been largely uncorrelated with the broader market. This is typical for many cryptocurrencies. The recent beta indicates the correlation with the market is starting to rise.
*   **Cap:** The market cap is relatively small (0.0B), meaning the investment will bring little influence to the market.

    *   **SMA Consistency:** The 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) are all the same. This suggests that the price has been relatively stable over the recent short, medium, and longer term.

    *   Hybrid Signal: Buy 90% of cash (88521190 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
    *   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: 0.0 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
    *   Expected Return (%): 427718.1

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.8 indicates a medium level of risk and suggests that investment is recommended.
    *   **RSI:**  An RSI of 45.09 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.25 suggests that the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, indicating a potential upward trend, but the magnitude is small.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:**  The "Buy 90% of cash" signal, combined with the "Safe" designation and MRI of 0.80, is a generally positive signal.
    *   **Divergence Change:** "Short-term decline" in relative divergence suggests Uniswap has underperformed its comparison recently.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return is very optimistic and should be viewed with caution. It likely reflects the inherent volatility and growth potential associated with the crypto market.
