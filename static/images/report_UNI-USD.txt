**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Exhibits extremely high growth rates in recent periods (2021-2025).

*   **Alpha:** Excessively high Alpha values suggest substantial outperformance compared to a benchmark (likely the market).
*   **Beta:** Negative Beta values indicate an inverse correlation with the market (S&P 500), although very close to zero.  A Beta near zero means the returns are almost entirely independent of the market. This suggests the asset's price movements are driven by its own specific factors, rather than broad market trends.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization data is not provided.
