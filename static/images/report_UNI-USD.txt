| 2019-2021  | -80.0%  | 87.8% | -119.0%   | -0.1   | 0.0    |
| 2020-2022  | 300.0%  | 87.8% | 300.0%    | -0.1   | 0.0    |

| 2023-2025  | 6278.0% | 95.8% | 6255.0%   | 0.2   | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR is incredibly volatile, ranging from -80% to 15014%, showcasing the high-growth but also high-risk nature of Uniswap.  Recent years (2021-2025) show exceptionally high growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD is consistently high (87.8% to 95.8%), indicating significant potential for losses during downturns. This is typical for cryptocurrencies.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is very high, reflecting the fact that Uniswap vastly outperforms the benchmark (S&P 500) over these periods. However, keep in mind this is a high-risk asset.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is consistently low, near zero. This indicates that Uniswap's returns are relatively uncorrelated with the overall market (S&P 500).  This can be both a benefit and a risk.  It *might* offer diversification, but it also means it won't necessarily rise *with* the market. The beta for 2023-2025 period is positive, although still small, indicating that the returns are starting to move in sync with the benchmark.
*   **Cap(B):** All years have a Cap(B) of 0.0, indicating there is no statistically significant evidence that the alpha is attributable to market inefficiencies captured by the benchmark (S&P500).

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Uniswap (UNI-USD) demonstrates the characteristics of a high-growth, high-risk asset. Its cumulative return vastly outperforms the S&P 500, but the maximum drawdowns are substantial. The CAGR fluctuates considerably, indicating extreme volatility.

The recent news cycle highlights both positive and negative factors. Positive signals include price recovery and a rally driven by a fee switch proposal. Negative signals include institutional selling pressure. The fact that Bitcoin's movements are highlighted implies correlation with the broader crypto market.

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. The RSI is neutral, while the PPO is slightly positive. The Market Risk Indicator recommends a medium investment level. The exceptionally high expected return should be interpreted with extreme caution, as it reflects the inherent volatility and speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market.

**In conclusion, Uniswap presents a high-reward, high-risk investment opportunity. Potential investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance, conduct thorough due diligence, and be prepared for significant price swings.** The lack of analyst consensus data makes a definitive recommendation difficult. Furthermore, the provided price data for the "Close" (0.0001626) seems unusually low compared to the price points mentioned in the news articles (e.g., $6.20, $8.40). This discrepancy should be investigated and resolved for accurate analysis.
