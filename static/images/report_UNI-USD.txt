**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Extremely high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) demonstrate the rapid growth of Uniswap over these periods.

*   **Beta:** Beta values range from 0.1 to 3.1. A Beta of 0.1 (2020-2022) indicates very low correlation with the market. Betas of 2.8 and 3.1 suggest higher volatility than the market (S&P 500), meaning Uniswap's price swings are more pronounced.

*   **RSI:** 45.09 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.25 (Indicates a slight uptrend momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (88521190 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) - A strong buy signal based on a specific model.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 427822.4 (Very high expected return, potentially unrealistic)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests medium investment risk. The RSI is neutral. The PPO shows uptrend momentum. The hybrid signal is strongly bullish. The divergence indicates a short-term decline. The "Expected Return" figure is extraordinarily high and should be viewed with extreme skepticism; it likely reflects the inherent volatility and potential of the crypto market, but also the difficulty of accurately predicting long-term returns.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Bullish Forecasts:** Several articles project future price increases for Uniswap.
*   **Institutional Activity:** A report mentions institutional investors selling UNI, but also indicates a prior period of significant gains.
*   **Fee Switch Proposal:** News about a fee switch proposal triggering a DeFi rally suggests potential positive catalysts.
*   **Broader Market Context:** An article referencing Bitcoin's price drop suggests that Uniswap is influenced by the overall cryptocurrency market trends.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed, with positive forecasts offset by institutional selling and dependence on the broader crypto market. The fee switch proposal seems to be a significant driver.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Uniswap has delivered exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500 but exhibits extremely high volatility and risk, as indicated by the 100% MDD and the Beta values. The high Alpha shows it has outperformed its benchmark. Recent price action is relatively stable. Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with a strong buy signal contradicted by a recent short-term downtrend in relative divergence. News sentiment is cautiously optimistic, focusing on future growth, but acknowledging the influence of the broader cryptocurrency market and potential institutional selling pressure. The "Expected Return" figure is wildly optimistic and needs scrutiny.

**Conclusion:**

Uniswap is a high-risk, high-reward investment. Its historical performance is impressive, but its volatility is a major concern. The positive news around the fee switch proposal is promising, but investors should be aware of the broader market risks and the potential for sharp price swings. The MRI suggests a medium investment, but the MDD suggests caution.
