**1. Return Rate Comparison (Uniswap vs. S&P 500)**

*   **Ticker:** UNI-USD
*   **Company:** Uniswap - A decentralized exchange protocol on the Ethereum blockchain.
*   **Uniswap Cumulative Return:** 7223.4976%

    *   Max: 306014.5
    *   Relative Divergence: 2.4

**Analysis of Return Rate:**

Uniswap has drastically outperformed the S&P 500 by a very large margin in the specific timeframe examined. The relative divergence of 2.4 suggests the current divergence level is near the lower end of its historical range; it's important to note that "historical range" is specific to the defined period and may not reflect long-term trends.

**Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:**

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD   | Alpha     | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|-------|-----------|------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | 300.0%    | 100.0%| 301.0%    | 0.1  | 0.0    |
| 2021-2023  | 15014.0%  | 100.0%| 15013.0%  | 2.8  | 0.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 8663.0%   | 100.0%| 8643.0%   | 3.1  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Extremely high CAGRs across all periods indicate exceptional growth, especially from 2021-2023. However, note the diminishing returns in the most recent period (2022-2024) albeit still at a high level.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 100% MDD in all periods is a very concerning sign and suggests an investor could potentially lose their entire investment value. This reflects the high volatility and risk associated with Uniswap, particularly given the context of the provided news events.
*   **Alpha:** Very high alpha values suggest that the return is significantly above what would be expected given the market and Beta.
*   **Beta:** Beta ranges from 0.1 to 3.1. Values greater than 1 indicate that Uniswap price is more volatile than the market (S&P 500)
*   **Cap(B):** A capacity of 0.0 indicates that this security is extremely volatile with wild gyrations.

**Analysis of Price Fluctuations:**

*   **RSI:** 45.09
*   **PPO:** 0.25
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (88521190 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-04-17)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 427822.4%

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation from the MRI suggests a balanced risk/reward profile *according to that specific indicator*. However, given the preceding data, this should be treated with caution.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 45.09 is in neutral territory, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO (0.25) suggests a slight upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 90% of cash" signal would typically be a bullish sign, but the "Safe" designation is questionable given the MDD and volatility. The 0% cash ratio could be aggressive.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** Recent short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism, given the MDD.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Uniswap (UNI-USD) has demonstrated exceptional historical returns, vastly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this comes with extremely high risk, as evidenced by the 100% Maximum Drawdown. The high volatility is also confirmed by Beta's range of 0.1 to 3.1 values.

Recent news highlights sensitivity to protocol changes (fee switch proposal), vulnerability to large sell-offs by institutional investors, and correlation with the broader cryptocurrency market. Price predictions are common, emphasizing the speculative nature of the asset.

The Market Risk Indicator suggests a moderate investment risk, which seems optimistic given the other data points. The Hybrid Signal leans towards buying, but the expected return of over 427000% is unrealistic.

**Conclusion:**

Uniswap presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The potential for substantial returns exists, but the risk of significant losses is equally high. Any investment decision should be made with a full understanding of these risks and a risk tolerance appropriate for highly volatile assets.
