**6) Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's performance is significantly underperforming the S&P 500. While recent earnings have slightly beaten expectations, the overall trend and financial ratios present a concerning picture.  The dramatically negative expected return, coupled with the low RSI and negative PPO, suggests considerable downside risk.  The price is below key moving averages, confirming a bearish trend.  Although the RSI suggests oversold conditions, a long-term investment in PYPL relative to the S&P 500 appears to be high-risk based on the provided data.  Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance is warranted before considering any investment.
