**6. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500, despite consistent earnings beats and relatively stable financial fundamentals.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the negative PPO and significantly low RSI, coupled with the high Market Risk Indicator, point towards continued bearish sentiment.  The large negative daily price change highlights the market's negative reaction. While positive earnings and strong profit margins suggest underlying strength, the negative market sentiment and high beta suggest caution. A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) could potentially benefit from the current undervaluation if the negative sentiment reverses, but significant risk is present.  The extremely negative expected return figure should be verified and contextualized before relying on it.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative market sentiment and assessment of future growth prospects is crucial before making any investment decision.
