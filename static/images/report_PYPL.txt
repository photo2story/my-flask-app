* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.40
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $84.10

* **PPO:** -0.54 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -505.6% (This extremely negative figure suggests a significant projected underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, based on current trends. This should be treated with extreme caution.  It's vital to consider the limitations of this prediction).

The indicators point towards a bearish trend, although the RSI is not decisively in oversold territory.  The extremely negative expected return, if accurate, necessitates careful consideration before any long-term investment decision.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The latest quarterly earnings show a consistent trend of exceeding expectations (EPS beats). However, there's a slight decline in EPS over the past few quarters.

* **EPS Trends:**  Generally showing a slight decline in recent quarters, though still beating expectations.
* **Revenue:** While the revenue numbers fluctuate slightly quarter to quarter, they remain largely consistent around the $7.8B mark.  There is no clear upward or downward trend readily apparent from this limited data.
* **Significant Changes:** The most noticeable change is the decreasing EPS despite the relatively stable revenue.  Investigating the reason for this is critical for further analysis.

* **Revenue:** Revenue has been relatively stable, fluctuating slightly around $7.8B - $8.0B in the recent quarters.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margin is also relatively stable, hovering between 44.95% and 46.57%, indicating consistent profitability.
* **Equity:** Equity has slightly decreased over the last year, though it has varied little.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE fluctuates, reflecting changes in profitability and equity.  The fluctuation does not reveal a clear upward or downward trend.  This warrants further investigation to understand the root causes.

Overall, the financial data displays relatively consistent performance, but a deeper dive into the reasons for fluctuations in profit margin and ROE is necessary.
