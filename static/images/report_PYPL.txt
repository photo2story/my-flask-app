## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) is a multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system.  Over the measured period, PYPL's cumulative return (21.92%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (112.48%). The difference is -90.6%, placing it in the 8.1st percentile of the historical range of divergence between PYPL and VOO.  This suggests a substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high volatility in CAGR, with substantial periods of outperformance followed by significant underperformance. The consistently high Beta (around 1.0) indicates a high correlation with the market, implying that PYPL's performance closely tracks overall market trends.  However, the negative CAGRs in recent years indicate a significant challenge for the company.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $87.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $86.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $85.32

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, but below the 20-day moving average, suggesting some recent price consolidation or slight downward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.13 – This indicates the stock is near neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO:** -0.39 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change:** +0.4 – This shows a slight improvement in relative strength over the past 20 days.
* **Expected Return:** -442.6% – This extremely negative projected return over a long-term (2+ years) horizon compared to the S&P 500 is a significant concern. The provided 87.18 price does not trigger an alert for a sudden surge or drop. The very negative expected return overshadows the short-term positive relative strength.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 2024-10-29 | 1.2      | 1.07         | +0.13       |
| 2024-07-30 | 1.19     | 0.99         | +0.20       |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.4      | 1.22         | +0.18       |
| 2024-02-07 | 1.48     | 1.36         | +0.12       |
| 2023-11-01 | 1.3      | 1.22         | +0.08       |

In the last five quarters, PYPL consistently beat earnings expectations.  However, this positive trend needs to be viewed in the context of the overall negative performance.  Positive EPS surprises don't necessarily translate to positive stock price movement if broader market sentiment or company-specific concerns are negative.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin |

| 2024-06-30 | $7.88       | 45.76%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $7.70       | 44.95%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $8.03       | 45.75%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $7.42       | 45.42%        |

Revenue is relatively stable, although there's a slight downward trend in recent quarters. Profit margins remain strong, but there's a minor decline.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $20.17      | 5.01    |
| 2024-06-30 | $20.62      | 5.47    |
| 2024-03-31 | $20.70      | 4.29    |
| 2023-12-31 | $21.05      | 6.66    |
| 2023-09-30 | $19.74      | 5.17    |

Equity has experienced some fluctuation, and ROE shows variability.  The overall trend is not clearly positive or negative.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's recent performance is concerning. Despite consistent earnings beats and relatively stable revenue and profit margins, the stock has significantly underperformed the market, and the projected long-term return is severely negative relative to the S&P 500.  The high Beta suggests that PYPL’s fortunes are heavily tied to the broader market.  The negative expected return, coupled with the negative CAGR trend in recent years, raises serious questions about the future prospects of this stock, and this is not mitigated by the most recent earnings report.  While the technical indicators are not decisively bearish, the fundamental picture is weaker.  A long-term investor should carefully consider this significant underperformance and the dramatically negative projected return before investing.  Further investigation into the underlying causes of the underperformance is strongly recommended.
