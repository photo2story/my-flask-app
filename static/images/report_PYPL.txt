**0) Introduction:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. is a multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system in the majority of countries. This report analyzes PYPL's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering various financial metrics and indicators.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

PYPL's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500.  While VOO shows a cumulative return of 70.85%, PYPL exhibits a -42.77% return. This results in a substantial divergence of -113.6%, placing it at the 6.8th percentile of the historical range of divergence between -137.5% and 212.5%.

The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance over the years.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2015-2017  | 68.0% | 50.0% | 40.0% | -0.1 | 72.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 47.0% | 70.6% | 29.0% | 0.0 | 83.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 62.0% | 70.6% | 31.0% | 0.6 | 107.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 128.0% | 70.6% | 100.0% | 0.4 | 231.7 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is $61.0, slightly up from the previous close of $60.24 (a change of $1.26).  However, this small increase is overshadowed by the downward trend indicated by the moving averages:

* **5-day MA:** $61.62
* **20-day MA:** $64.16
* **60-day MA:** $72.20

All moving averages are above the current price, suggesting a potential downtrend.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 indicates a medium risk level.
* **RSI:** 42.35, below 50, suggests bearish momentum.
* **PPO:** 0.178, positive but relatively low, indicates weak bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +0.4 indicates short-term upward movement.
* **Expected Return:** -981.7%  This extremely negative figure suggests a very pessimistic outlook for future returns, particularly concerning.  This needs further investigation and clarification, as a -981.7% expected return is unrealistic.

The recent price increase of $1.26, while seemingly positive, doesn't significantly alter the overall bearish trend highlighted by the moving averages and the extremely negative expected return.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

PayPal has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters, suggesting positive underlying performance. However,  the provided data does not cover a long enough period to draw significant conclusions.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

PYPL's recent performance has been significantly underwhelming compared to the S&P 500. While the company shows consistent profitability and revenue, the extremely negative expected return and the substantial negative CAGR raise serious concerns. The negative Alpha indicates consistent underperformance relative to the market.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  Before any investment decision, further investigation is crucial to understand the reasons behind the drastically negative projected return and the recent sharp decline in performance.  The provided -981.7% expected return requires clarification and deeper analysis before it can be considered reliable.  A long-term investment approach should be carefully considered given the substantial risks.
