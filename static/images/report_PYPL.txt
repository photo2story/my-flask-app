* **5-Day Moving Average:** $77.06
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $84.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $86.35

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price change shows a slight increase from the previous close ($1.38 increase), which is not substantial enough to signify a significant reversal of the downtrend.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 25.67 (Suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity, although this should be considered alongside other factors.)

* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -0.5 (Shows a recent weakening in relative strength.)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -1460.0% (This extremely negative figure suggests a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term (2+ years), based on current data.  This warrants further investigation to understand the basis of this projection.)

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | EPS Surprise |

Equity has seen some fluctuation. ROE has been relatively stable but shows a decline in recent quarters.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

PYPL shows a mixed picture. While recent earnings have beaten expectations and profit margins remain strong, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over various timeframes.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, but the negative PPO and the large negative expected return against the market raise serious concerns. The high beta in recent years points to a high-risk investment.

Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the extremely negative projected long-term return.  A deeper dive into the company's strategic initiatives, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors affecting the digital payments industry would be necessary to make a more informed investment decision.  The provided -1460% expected return requires clarification, as it seems unrealistic based on the other data.  A reassessment of the methodology and assumptions behind this figure is needed.
