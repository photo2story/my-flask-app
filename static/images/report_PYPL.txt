2025-01-30 - Analysis Report
## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. is a multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system.

The cumulative return of PYPL is 24.13%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 119.68%.  This represents a significant underperformance of PYPL compared to the S&P 500. The provided data shows a current divergence of -95.6, placing it at the 6.9th percentile of the historical divergence range (-126.2 to 315.8).  This indicates that the current underperformance is relatively low compared to its historical range, but still significantly negative.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows highly variable performance over different time periods.  While some periods demonstrate exceptionally high growth (e.g., 2018-2020), others show substantial losses (e.g., 2021-2023).  The consistently near-1.0 Beta suggests that PYPL's price movements are highly correlated with the overall market.  However, the Alpha consistently being 1.0 in the provided data seems unrealistic and may indicate an error in the provided data.  Alpha should fluctuate.  The analysis of Alpha and Beta with such inconsistent CAGR data should be viewed with caution.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $88.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $89.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $86.79

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, indicating some short-term downward pressure. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. The recent price increase from the previous close ($0.65) warrants noting a minor positive momentum but is not a significant jump.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 51.87 - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.0165 -  A slightly positive value, suggesting a slightly bullish momentum, though very close to neutral.
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** 0.0 (-) - Indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** -571.0% - This extremely negative expected return is concerning and suggests a significantly pessimistic outlook regarding future performance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years).  The validity of this projection needs serious scrutiny.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, fluctuating around $7.8B-$8.0B. Profit margins are healthy and hover around 45-46%, showing slight fluctuation.

**Capital and Profitability:**

Equity fluctuates slightly. ROE (Return on Equity) is moderate and ranges between 4% and 6.7%, indicating varying profitability based on capital employed.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations, the projected extremely negative long-term return relative to the market is a significant red flag. The valuation needs further assessment.  The highly variable historical performance and the conflicting indicators (positive earnings surprises, but extremely negative long-term return projection) make a definitive recommendation challenging.  The -571% expected return should be investigated as it seems highly improbable and might be based on flawed assumptions or an erroneous calculation.  Further investigation into the inputs used for this prediction is necessary. The price shows some slight upward short-term momentum, but the overall outlook is uncertain and requires careful consideration before any investment decision.  Considering the volatility and inconsistent historical performance, rigorous due diligence is essential before investing.
