## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) is a multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system in the majority of countries.

The cumulative return of PYPL is 21.72%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 117.29%.  The difference is -95.6%, placing it at the 6.9th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a min/max range of -126.1% to 315.9%). This indicates that PYPL's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is relatively low compared to its historical performance range but still considerably lower.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values, consistently at 1.0 for Beta.  However, the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures reveal significant volatility and periods of substantial losses, especially in recent years (2020-2024).  This highlights the risk associated with PYPL despite its beta seemingly tracking the market.

The recent quarterly EPS results show some variability:

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This data was not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the provided timeframe.

More comprehensive data (especially regarding revenue trends and news impacting the stock) is needed to provide a more robust and conclusive assessment.  The high volatility and significant drawdowns highlighted by the CAGR and MDD figures should be carefully considered before investment.
