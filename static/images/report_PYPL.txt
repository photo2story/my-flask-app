    *   **Analysis:**
        *   **Early Years (2015-2017):** High growth (CAGR), positive alpha, and low beta suggest strong outperformance independent of the market.
        *   **Recent Years (2020-2025):**  A sharp decline in performance. Negative CAGR, significantly negative alpha, and a fluctuating beta.  The negative Alpha figures indicate underperformance relative to its benchmark after adjusting for risk, and the varying Beta indicates fluctuations in its volatility relative to the market.

*   **20-day SMA:** 63.7553
*   **60-day SMA:** 67.0859

    *   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 60-day SMA but near its 20-day SMA, and above its 5-day SMA.  This *might* indicate a short-term upward trend, but the longer-term trend (60-day) is still downwards. The modest price increase in the last market close suggests some positive momentum.

*   **Expected Return (%):** -8279.5

        *   **RSI & PPO:** RSI is below 50, suggesting slightly more selling pressure than buying pressure, but not oversold. The PPO is near zero, indicating that the short-term and long-term moving averages are relatively close to each other.
        *   **Hybrid Signal:** Despite the negative return figures, the system is recommending buying PayPal. This could be based on other factors not explicitly provided. This seems contradictory to the overall picture.
        *   **Relative Divergence Change:** Confirms short-term negative momentum.
        *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, indicating significant risk and potential for further decline.

The mixed news flow reflects this uncertainty.
