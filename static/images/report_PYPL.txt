## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) is a leading technology platform and digital payments company enabling digital and mobile payments on a global basis.

The cumulative return for PYPL is 19.69%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 114.09%.  This represents a significant underperformance of PYPL compared to the S&P 500. The provided data shows a divergence of -94.4, placing it in the 7.2nd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests PYPL's performance has been considerably weaker than the broader market over the period analyzed.  The Alpha consistently near 1.0 in the provided data implies a close tracking of the market's performance, suggesting a lack of significant outperformance or underperformance.  However, the recent steep decline in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is alarming.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $85.45
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $89.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $83.32

The current price is below all three moving averages, indicating a possible short-term bearish trend.  The relatively small gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages suggest a lack of strong momentum in either direction.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.14 (Slightly below neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** -0.38 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +0.1 (Suggests a slight increase in relative strength compared to the benchmark recently, but needs further context.)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests that the model predicts no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment, based on the data provided.  This should be considered cautiously as market conditions and company performance can change significantly.)


Given the current price of $85.45 is below the moving averages and the negative PPO, it does not indicate a sharp rebound. There is no indication of a sudden upward or downward movement (sharp rise or fall) given the information provided.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some volatility in EPS.  While EPS generally exceeded expectations, recent quarters show a decline in actual EPS and a narrowing margin against expected EPS.  This trend needs further investigation to determine the underlying drivers.  There's no data on revenue growth trends to further analyze the financial health.

Revenue shows slight fluctuation around $7.8B, with a minor decrease in the latest quarter. Profit margins are consistently high (45-47%) but also show slight downward trend. Equity is generally stable around $20B,  with ROE (Return on Equity) showing some variability but generally remaining above 5%.  The recent slight decline in ROE might be a cause for concern, warrants further investigation into the contributing factors.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional data on recent news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to provide a comprehensive analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, showing a negative divergence. Recent price action suggests a potential bearish trend, supported by the PPO and the price being below its moving averages. While earnings have generally beaten expectations, there's a concerning downward trend in both revenue and EPS recently. The financial information reveals strong profit margins, but a declining ROE signals potential areas for concern. Additional information on recent news and analyst opinions is necessary to complete a thorough assessment.  Given the current data, a long-term investment in PYPL carries significant risk, especially considering the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the downward trend in key financial metrics.
