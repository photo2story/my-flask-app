## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

PYPL's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price action shows the stock trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a bearish trend. Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) suggest the stock is oversold, but the negative expected return and substantial negative alpha raise significant concerns.  Earnings have generally beaten expectations, but revenue growth is somewhat muted.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) is a multinational financial technology company operating a worldwide online payments system.

* **PYPL Cumulative Return:** -0.8019
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 115.9133
* **Return Difference:** -116.71  (PYPL underperformed VOO by a substantial margin).
* **Relative Divergence:** 2.1% (This indicates that the current underperformance is relatively low compared to the historical range of underperformance.)  This is a misleading metric. The important fact is the *magnitude* of the underperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|

| 2023-2025  | -13.0% | 19.2% | -70.0% | 3.1 | 70.7 |

The data reveals significant volatility and a dramatic decline in performance in recent years,  highlighted by substantially negative alphas in the later years.  The beta also increased significantly indicating higher market sensitivity in recent periods.


**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** 71.05
* **Last Market Price:** 71.42 (Slight increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 72.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 77.4442
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 84.6755

The stock is trading below all three moving averages, confirming the bearish trend. The small price increase in the last market data is not significant enough to reverse this trend.

* **RSI:** 27.93 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.74 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.8 (Short-term bearish)

* **Price Change:** The recent 0.52 increase is too small to be considered a significant upward reversal.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's performance has been significantly poor relative to the S&P 500, exhibiting substantial negative alpha and high volatility in recent years. While recent earnings have exceeded expectations and the financial position appears reasonably healthy, the negative expected return and persistently bearish technical indicators present considerable risk. The extremely negative expected return (-2312.2%) needs further explanation as it is unrealistic in terms of any reasonable market behavior.  Further investigation is needed to understand the methodology and assumptions that generated this figure.  Overall,  based on this data, PYPL presents a high-risk investment at this time.  A long-term investment strategy would need to consider a much longer timeframe and account for the significant underperformance against the broad market.
