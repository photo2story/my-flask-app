## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Review

This report analyzes PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), a leading technology company facilitating online payments and digital financial services globally.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PYPL has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period.  While VOO has shown a cumulative return of 82.76%, PYPL experienced a -36.76% loss. This represents a substantial divergence of -119.5%, placing it in the 5.1 percentile of its historical range of relative performance against the S&P 500 (-137.5% to 212.5%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a mixed performance history. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) showed periods of strong growth (e.g., 128% from 2018-2020), recent years have been marked by significant negative returns (-247% from 2021-2023 and -117% from 2022-2024).  The Beta fluctuates, suggesting varying sensitivity to overall market movements. Notably, the negative Alpha in recent periods indicates underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures in several years point to significant volatility and risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The closing price is $67.24.  The stock price is currently trading above its 5-day ($65.95) and 20-day ($62.55) moving averages, but below its 60-day moving average ($68.42). This suggests some short-term upward momentum, but potential resistance at the 60-day average.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776, suggesting a low to medium risk level.
* **RSI:** 67.32, indicating the stock is approaching overbought territory.
* **PPO:** 1.45, a positive value suggesting potential upward momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change:** -0.7, indicating a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -1383.6%, This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 strongly suggests significant underperformance is projected over the long term (2+ years)  unless significant changes occur.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

PYPL has consistently exceeded earnings per share (EPS) expectations in recent quarters.  While this is positive, it hasn't translated to positive stock performance.  Further investigation into revenue and gross profit figures would provide a more comprehensive picture.

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-04-29 | 1.33   | 1.16           |
| 2025-02-04 | 1.19   | 1.11           |
| 2024-10-29 | 1.20   | 1.07           |
| 2024-07-30 | 1.19   | 0.99           |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.40   | 1.22           |


**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data is available. This significantly limits the depth of the financial analysis.  This data is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of the company's financial health and future prospects.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's recent performance has been drastically poor, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  While recent earnings have exceeded expectations, this positive development hasn't translated into positive stock price movement. The lack of crucial financial data (revenue, gross profit) hinders a complete assessment.  The high negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests a very high risk and potential for further losses over the long term. Further investigation into the underlying reasons for the underperformance, along with access to complete financial statements, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility and negative Alpha suggest that this stock carries significant risk.
