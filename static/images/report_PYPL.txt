    **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR & MDD:**  Early periods (2015-2020) show strong growth (high CAGR) but also significant drawdown risk (MDD).  More recent periods (2020 onward) display substantial losses (negative CAGR) and consistently high MDD.
    *   **Alpha:**  Alpha was positive in earlier periods, indicating outperformance compared to the market risk-adjusted return.  However, recent years show strongly negative alpha, meaning PYPL significantly underperformed its expected return based on market movements.
    *   **Beta:**  Beta has fluctuated.  Early periods had low positive betas, suggesting relatively low correlation with the market. Recent periods have seen negative betas, indicating an inverse relationship with the market, but the negative Beta is significant (2023-2025). This could mean PYPL's performance has become negatively correlated with the broader market, where PYPL is performing poorly when the market is doing well.
    *   **Capital:** Capital, or market capitalization, varied over the periods but generally decreased over the recent periods.

*   **20-day Moving Average:** $69.73
*   **60-day Moving Average:** $67.12

    **Analysis:** The stock price has recently decreased. The price is below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential short-term downward momentum but longer-term support. The recent price drop of -2.24% suggests a negative market reaction (possible reaction to news or events).
