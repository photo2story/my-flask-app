## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Relative Strength:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) is a leading technology company operating a worldwide online payments system.  Over the analyzed period, PYPL's cumulative return is 29.78%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which achieved a 125.91% return.  This represents a difference of -96.13%.  The relative strength index of -6.56% indicates that PYPL's performance lags significantly behind the S&P 500, ranking it below the majority of past performance data within the observed range.  The provided alpha and beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (S&P 500), with periods of significant outperformance and underperformance. The high maximum drawdown (MDD) across several periods signals considerable risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $86.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $85.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $82.96
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $78.77

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (76.41):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (0.04):** A slightly positive value suggests a bullish momentum, although weak.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.43 indicates a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0%.  This suggests that based on current data and projections, long-term (2+ years) investment is not expected to outperform the S&P 500.  This forecast is based on the considerable underperformance relative to the market observed. Further analysis is needed to confirm. The closing price near the 86.78 level doesn't suggest any immediate sharp movements, considering it's slightly above the recent average. However, the overbought RSI raises some concerns.
