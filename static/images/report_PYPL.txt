| 2025-02-04 | 1.19  | 1.11      | 0.08       |
| 2024-10-29 | 1.20  | 1.07      | 0.13       |

**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data was provided, hindering a complete financial analysis.  This information is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of PYPL's financial health and future prospects.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PYPL's performance has been significantly underwhelming compared to the S&P 500, showing a large negative divergence. While recent earnings have exceeded expectations, this hasn't translated into positive stock price movement.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition and bearish momentum, though this doesn't guarantee a price reversal. The extremely negative long-term expected return (-1469.3%) is a serious red flag.  The lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) further limits the analysis.  Based on the current information, a long-term investment in PYPL compared to the S&P 500 carries substantial risk and would not be recommended without further investigation and improved performance metrics.
