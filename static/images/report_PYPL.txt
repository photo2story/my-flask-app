## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Analysis

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), a leading online payments company facilitating online money transfers and merchant services globally.  We will examine its performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), assess its recent price movements, and evaluate key financial indicators.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

PYPL's cumulative return is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **PYPL Cumulative Return:** -41.50%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 73.51%

Alpha and Beta analysis shows considerable volatility and varying market sensitivity over the years.  While periods of high CAGR were observed, the recent years show significantly negative returns, even underperforming the market substantially, marked by negative alpha and high MDD.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $70.78

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.

* **PPO:** 0.55 (Positive, suggesting potential bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -1059.1% (This extremely negative figure suggests a significant downside risk. It needs further investigation and context to interpret accurately.  The timeframe (2 years or more) is also relevant, and the current high risk profile should be considered.)

The positive change in the 20-day relative divergence, combined with a positive PPO, suggests a potential short-term upward trend despite the low RSI and overall negative expected return which needs further investigation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PYPL has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent earnings have been positive, surpassing expectations, the overall performance remains concerning. The stock price is currently below its moving averages, hinting at a potential downtrend. Technical indicators present a mixed signal, with some suggesting short-term upward momentum while others point to a higher risk profile.  The extremely negative projected long-term return (-1059.1%) warrants significant investigation and caution.  A long-term investment strategy requires a careful evaluation of the underlying business fundamentals and a comprehensive risk assessment in light of the significant underperformance relative to the broader market. Further investigation is needed to fully explain the substantial discrepancy between recent positive earnings surprises and the overall negative projected return.  More detailed analysis including competitors' performance, industry trends and macro-economic factors are needed for a complete picture.
