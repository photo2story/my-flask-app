**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Close:** $86.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $85.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $82.96
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $78.77

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.  However, the recent price of $88.6 (Last-market) shows a short-term spike, which needs to be considered in the overall analysis.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 76.41 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 0.04 (Slightly positive, indicating bullish momentum but weak)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +0.43 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, 2+ years):** 0.0% (This suggests that given the historical data and recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500, there is no projected long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This is a cautious estimation and further research is needed).

The recent price spike to $88.6 may represent a short-lived bounce and does not invalidate the overall negative trend of the stock against the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The company has consistently beaten earnings per share (EPS) estimates in recent quarters, but the growth rate seems to be slowing down.

PYPL's performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, despite showing periods of positive alpha and generally strong profitability. Recent negative CAGR, high Beta, and overbought RSI suggest caution. While recent earnings have beaten expectations,  the long-term outlook relative to the S&P 500 remains uncertain and currently projects no outperformance.  A comprehensive review of recent news, including analyst sentiment and any material events affecting the company, is necessary to gain a more complete picture. The recent price spike needs further investigation to understand if it is a sustainable trend or merely short-term volatility.
