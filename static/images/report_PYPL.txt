## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. is a multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system.

The cumulative return of PYPL is 25.55%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which shows a 120.10% cumulative return.  The difference is -94.6%, placing it at the 7.1 percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500 (-126.2% to 315.8%).  This indicates substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided alpha values of 1.0 throughout various periods suggest that the stock has historically outperformed the market, even with the recent underperformance,  but this is contradicted by the CAGR numbers which indicate significant losses in recent years.  This discrepancy requires further investigation into the calculation methodology. The beta of consistently 90 implies a very high sensitivity to market movements.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $89.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.44

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's recent performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, despite consistent earnings beats.  While the company demonstrates stable revenue and profit margins,  the extremely negative projected long-term return (-529%) relative to the S&P 500 raises significant concerns.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  Further investigation into the methodology for calculating the projected return and alpha values is crucial.  The current price is near short-term support levels, but the longer-term outlook based on the provided data is negative.  Additional fundamental and technical analysis would be necessary to provide a more comprehensive assessment. The discrepancies between historical alpha and recent performance needs clarification.
