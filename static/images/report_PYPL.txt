## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Review

This report analyzes PayPal Holdings Inc., a leading technology company operating a worldwide online payments system.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

PYPL's cumulative return is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

| Metric                  | PYPL       | VOO         | Difference |
|--------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Cumulative Return (%)    | -36.76%     | 82.76%      | -119.5%     |
| Relative Divergence (%) | 5.1%       |             |             |


This shows PYPL underperformed VOO considerably, with a large negative divergence.  While the relative divergence of 5.1% suggests it is relatively closer to its historical minimum underperformance against the S&P 500 compared to its maximum underperformance, this is still a significant negative deviation. The provided Alpha and Beta analysis further highlights the underperformance compared to the market (VOO) especially in recent years (2020-2025).

| 2023-2025  | -32.0% | 80.0% | -57.0% | -1.8 | 65.4 |

The table shows a significant decline in CAGR and a substantial increase in MDD in recent years. The negative alpha values in the last three years indicate consistent underperformance compared to the benchmark.  The fluctuating beta suggests varying market sensitivity over time.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

| Metric             | Value      |
|----------------------|------------|
| Closing Price       | $67.24     |
| 5-Day MA            | $65.95     |
| 20-Day MA           | $62.55     |
| 60-Day MA           | $68.42     |

The stock price is slightly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend, though above its 5 and 20-day moving averages, indicating some short-term support.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk) - Suggests a relatively moderate level of risk.
* **RSI:** 67.32 -  Approaching overbought territory (70+), indicating potential for a price correction.
* **PPO:** 1.45 - Positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.7 -  Short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -1383.6% - This extremely negative figure strongly suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), based on current trends.  This needs further investigation, as a -1383.6% return is highly improbable.  The provided data likely needs clarification or correction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| 2025-04-29 | 1.33   | 1.16          | Beat      |
| 2025-02-04 | 1.19   | 1.11          | Beat      |
| 2024-10-29 | 1.20   | 1.07          | Beat      |
| 2024-07-30 | 1.19   | 0.99          | Beat      |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.40   | 1.22          | Beat      |

PYPL has consistently beaten earnings expectations in recent quarters, which is a positive sign.

**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided, hindering a comprehensive financial analysis.  This is crucial information missing from the analysis.

**6. Overall Summary:**

PYPL has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years, as evidenced by its negative cumulative return and consistently negative alpha. While recent earnings have been positive, surpassing expectations, the substantial negative expected return (requiring careful verification of the provided data) and lack of key financial data like revenue and gross profit significantly hinder a complete assessment.  The negative alpha and beta values, especially in the last few years, point to persistent underperformance relative to the market, raising concerns for long-term investors.  Further investigation into the exceptionally low expected return value is needed before drawing definitive conclusions. The RSI approaching overbought territory suggests potential short-term price corrections.  More comprehensive financial data is urgently needed for a complete and accurate assessment of PYPL's financial health and future prospects.
