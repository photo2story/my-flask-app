## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Review

This report analyzes PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), a leading online payment system provider, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PYPL's cumulative return of -11.29% significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a return of 89.44%. The difference (-100.7%) places it at the 5.5th percentile of the historical range (-124.6% to 313%).

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals a volatile performance history.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of strong growth (e.g., 2018-2020 at 177%), recent years (2021-2025) show substantial losses. The high beta values (mostly above 0.4, and reaching 0.9) indicate high sensitivity to market movements.  The negative alpha in the most recent period (2023-2025) suggests underperformance relative to the market even considering its beta.  Market capitalization fluctuates significantly, reflecting the company's performance.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 72.0% | 5.7% | 54.0% | 0.4 | 73.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 56.0% | 51.7% | 49.0% | 0.1 | 84.3 |
| 2017-2019  | 77.0% | 51.7% | 58.0% | 0.2 | 108.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 177.0% | 79.1% | 143.0% | 0.1 | 234.9 |
| 2019-2021  | 98.0% | 79.1% | 25.0% | 0.1 | 189.1 |
| 2020-2022  | -108.0% | 79.1% | -119.0% | 0.2 | 71.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -293.0% | 59.1% | -311.0% | 0.9 | 61.6 |
| 2022-2024  | -142.0% | 79.3% | -165.0% | 0.5 | 85.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is $66.1.  The stock is trading below its 5-day ($67.07), 20-day ($68.71), and 60-day ($77.56) moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The last market data shows a slight increase of $1.37.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.4354 indicates a low to medium risk level.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 41.45 suggests the stock is in oversold territory, but not extremely so.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.0105 indicates a weak bullish signal, but close to neutral.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent -0.7 change indicates a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -956.9% is a highly negative prediction.  This dramatically negative figure requires further investigation into its calculation methodology.  It suggests extremely poor long-term prospects. The statement "Long-term (2+ years) investment" is contradictory to the massively negative expected return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

PYPL has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.  However, the data doesn't show any clear trend in the magnitude of this outperformance.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS |
|---|---|---|

**5. Financial Information:**

| 2024-06-30 | $20.62B | 5.47% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL shows a mixed picture. While the company continues to generate consistent revenue and profit margins, its stock price has significantly underperformed the market in recent years. The high beta suggests substantial market sensitivity. The extremely negative expected return needs further clarification.  The positive earnings surprises are encouraging, but the overall negative trend and high volatility pose significant risk.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk and volatility before investing.  Further investigation is needed to validate the exceptionally low expected return figure.  The current price is below several key moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  Despite exceeding EPS expectations, the substantial underperformance compared to the market is a primary concern.
