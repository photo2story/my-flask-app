## PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. is a multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system.  This report analyzes PYPL's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and examining key financial indicators.  PYPL shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, exhibiting negative returns while the benchmark experienced strong growth.  Further analysis is needed to determine the drivers of this underperformance and to assess future prospects.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PYPL's cumulative return is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is substantial:

* **PYPL Cumulative Return:** -39.39%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 77.05%
* **Return Difference:** -116.4% (This represents the current distance from the S&P500 return, with a relative divergence of 6.0% based on the historical range of -137.5% to 212.5%.)


The provided alpha and beta data show mixed results across different time periods. While some periods demonstrate positive alpha (outperformance),  the recent years (2021-2025) consistently show negative alpha and a high beta, indicating significant sensitivity to market movements and considerable underperformance relative to the market benchmark. The significant negative CAGR in the latest years is particularly concerning.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates but seems to show some correlation with the overall market trends.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

PYPL's recent price action shows a mixed picture.  The closing price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it sits considerably below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.

* **Closing Price:** $64.77
* **5-Day MA:** $61.99
* **20-Day MA:** $62.50
* **60-Day MA:** $70.39

The recent price change of 3.7% shows a relatively sharp increase from the previous close. This is worth further investigation to understand the cause of this sudden increase.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk) –  Indicates a moderate level of risk associated with the stock.
* **RSI:** 56.15 – Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.94 – Positive, implying bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.7 –  Short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -1139.9% – This extremely negative expected return is concerning and requires further investigation.  It suggests a significant potential for further losses, especially considering the current market conditions and the considerable underperformance against the S&P 500.  The extremely negative value suggests a significant flaw or error in the calculation method of this metric, further underscoring a need for further evaluation of the methodology and inputs used.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

PYPL has consistently exceeded earnings per share (EPS) expectations in recent quarters, although the magnitude of the exceedance varies.  This positive surprise might be partially responsible for the recent price increase but needs deeper analysis alongside broader financial metrics to form a complete picture.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PYPL's performance has significantly lagged behind the S&P 500 in recent years, resulting in substantial negative returns. While recent earnings have exceeded expectations and show some short-term positive momentum, the long-term outlook remains uncertain. The extremely negative expected return requires further investigation into the methodology and inputs used for its calculation.  The negative alpha and high beta indicate a significant risk to investment.  A thorough examination of the company's strategic direction, competitive landscape, and potential catalysts for growth is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further analysis including macro-economic factors and competitor analysis would be beneficial for a comprehensive assessment.  The validity and accuracy of some provided metrics, particularly the expected return, needs to be verified before drawing definitive conclusions.
