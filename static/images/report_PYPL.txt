## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) is a multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system.

The cumulative return of PYPL is 25.49%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.58%.  The difference is -97.1%, placing it in the 6.6th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates that PYPL's performance has been considerably weaker than the broader market over the measured period.  The provided Alpha and Beta values show consistent Beta around 1.0 suggesting the stock's price movement closely tracks the overall market while Alpha consistently around 1.0 is inconsistent and unlikely to be reliable. The high CAGR values reported in some years are misleading given the dramatic negative CAGR in subsequent years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $89.73
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $90.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $86.24

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend.  However, it is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a possible upward trend in the medium to long term.  The recent small price decrease (-0.13) is not significant enough to signal a major shift.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.74 –  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions.  The market is relatively neutral.
* **PPO:** 0.3352 – A positive value suggests potential bullish momentum, although the magnitude is modest.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.4 – Suggests a recent short-term weakening of the price relative to the overall trend.
* **Expected Return:** -582.1% – This extremely negative expected return needs further clarification.  The calculation method and underlying assumptions are critical in assessing this figure's validity.  It is likely unrealistic. This figure, compared to the S&P 500, implies extremely poor future performance.

PayPal has consistently beaten earnings expectations in recent quarters, indicating positive performance relative to analysts' predictions.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable around $7.8B, with a profit margin consistently around 45-47%.  There's a slight downward trend in revenue and profit margin in recent quarters.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown some fluctuations, while ROE shows some volatility.  Generally, the company shows a healthy return on equity.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's stock performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the evaluated period. While recent earnings have beaten expectations, the overall picture is mixed.  The negative long-term expected return (-582.1%) is highly suspect and requires deeper investigation into its calculation methodology and assumptions before it can be considered. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook, but the substantial underperformance relative to the market raises serious concerns. Further investigation into the -582.1% expected return projection is necessary to understand its basis and validity. The consistently reported Alpha values around 1.0 are suspicious and not reliable.  A deeper dive into the financial statements and market analysis is needed before making any investment decisions.  The reported extremely negative long-term return outlook is likely unrealistic and should be treated with extreme caution.
