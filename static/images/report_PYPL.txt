## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Performance Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

PYPL's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is currently undervalued, but the substantial negative expected return and recent negative price momentum warrant caution.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) is a leading technology company operating a worldwide online payments system.

PYPL's cumulative return is 9.23%, while VOO's is 119.79%.  This represents a significant underperformance of -110.6 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -3.5 indicates PYPL's performance is relatively low compared to its historical performance range against VOO.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance and significant risk.  While periods of high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) are observed,  the recent years (2021-2025) show dramatically negative CAGRs and high betas, indicating substantial sensitivity to market movements. The high and volatile Beta suggests significant market risk.  The negative alpha in recent years shows underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) further underscores the volatility and risk associated with investing in PYPL.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $78.24

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $86.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $86.99

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price increase of $1.20 from the previous close might be a temporary bounce, but it's too early to confirm a trend reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 25.34 – Suggests the stock is oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.62 – Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -4.2 – Shows a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -1252.2% –  This extremely negative expected return, particularly considering the long-term timeframe (2+ years), suggests significant risk and potential for further losses compared to the S&P 500.  This warrants serious caution.  The data may be reflecting market sentiment rather than intrinsic value.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 2024-02-07 | 1.48 | 1.36 | 0.12 |

While PYPL has consistently exceeded earnings expectations, the overall trend reflects a slight decline in EPS, and this is not sufficient to offset the significant negative factors.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility and negative returns in recent years. While some positive signals exist (oversold RSI, positive EPS surprises), the extremely negative expected return, low price relative to moving averages, and high beta strongly suggest caution.  The financial information indicates a relatively healthy company with high profit margins, but the overall market sentiment and investment risk are exceptionally high.  Considering the provided data, a long-term investment in PYPL carries substantial risk and is not recommended at this time, unless a significant fundamental shift occurs, increasing its intrinsic value considerably.  Further in-depth research and analysis are crucial before making any investment decisions.
