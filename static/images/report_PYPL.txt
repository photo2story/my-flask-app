* **PPO:** -0.44 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.6 (Short-term downward trend)

The current price of $83.36, while below recent moving averages, doesn't necessarily signal a dramatic price movement (rapid increase or decrease) based solely on this data.  The extremely negative expected return requires clarification and further scrutiny.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PayPal's recent performance has been disappointing, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  While earnings have consistently beat expectations, the negative expected return of -512.3% is alarming and requires further investigation to understand its basis. The stock price is currently below its moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The RSI and PPO indicators support this bearish sentiment.  Before investing, a thorough review of the underlying reasons for the large negative projected return is crucial.  Investors should carefully consider the risk involved given the significant historical volatility and recent underperformance.  The consistently positive earnings surprises warrant attention, but they haven't translated to comparable stock price appreciation.
