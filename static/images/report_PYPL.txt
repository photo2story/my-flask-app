    *   **Declining Performance:** The table reveals a sharp decline in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Alpha in recent years. From strong positive values in 2015-2020, both metrics have become significantly negative in 2020-2025.
    *   **Volatile Beta:** Beta fluctuates, indicating changing correlation with the market. Note that a negative beta for 2023-2025 indicates an inverse correlation with the market (though a coefficient so close to zero should be treated with care).

*   **60-day SMA:** \$66.01

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 20-day SMA and significantly below the 60-day SMA. This *suggests a short-term consolidation but a longer-term downtrend*.  The recent price increase indicates a potential minor rebound, but the overall trend remains concerning.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, which is relatively neutral, but doesn't reflect the significant underperformance.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 50.54 is neutral, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO indicates that short-term moving average is slightly above its longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal Contradiction:** It is difficult to understand a positive buy hybrid signal when every other measure indicates a downward trend. The Hybrid signal may be considering different factor inputs.
*   **Divergence Change:** Stagnant.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. It indicates that the model predicts very poor future performance compared to the S&P 500.

**Analysis:** The news sentiment is mixed. There are some positive articles highlighting potential catalysts like a bank charter bid, strong free cash flow, and arguments for long-term holding. However, the negative headlines regarding a sobering outlook from the CFO and decreased stake from a major investor raise concerns. The contrast in sentiment creates uncertainty.

*   **Analyst Disagreement:** Analysts are divided, with a consensus "Hold" rating, but with a wide range of target prices, suggesting uncertainty regarding the company's future.

The drastic divergence in return compared to the S&P 500 should be a primary concern for any potential investor. Additional research and careful consideration are essential before making any investment decisions. The current Hybrid Signal may need to be recalibrated to more accurately reflect underlying market conditions.
