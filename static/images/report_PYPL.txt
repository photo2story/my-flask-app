## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PayPal Holdings Inc. is a multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system.

As of the last data point, PYPL's cumulative return is 24.74%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 116.17%.  The difference is -91.4%, placing it at the 7.9th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates considerable underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided CAGR of 25% over 2015-2025 appears inconsistent with the cumulative return shown unless it represents a specific sub-period. The extremely high beta (1.0) suggests high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The negative alpha (-91%) indicates substantial underperformance compared to a benchmark adjusted for market risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $89.19
* **Last Market Price:** $89.27
* **5-day Moving Average:** $86.67
* **20-day Moving Average:** $87.19
* **60-day Moving Average:** $85.62

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, although the strength of this trend is questionable given the significant underperformance against the S&P 500.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.37 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.09 (Slightly positive, suggesting a potential bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.2 (Short-term upward momentum)

The Last-market price of $89.27 doesn't indicate a significant rapid upward or downward movement.  The expected return of -462.5% is exceptionally low and likely reflects a very pessimistic scenario or an error in the data.  It's crucial to clarify this figure.  Long-term investing (2+ years) in PYPL, relative to the S&P 500, carries significant downside risk based on this data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Despite consistent EPS beats, PYPL shows significant underperformance against the S&P 500, with a large negative alpha and high beta indicating high volatility and market sensitivity. Revenue growth is weak, and equity is declining. While the recent price action suggests a slight upward trend, the overall picture points to substantial risk. The exceptionally negative expected return requires further investigation to determine its validity.  The current valuation needs careful assessment before considering investment.  Further research into the company's strategic direction and competitive landscape is necessary before forming a conclusive opinion.
