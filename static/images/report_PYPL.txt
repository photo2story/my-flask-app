## PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. is a multinational financial technology company operating a worldwide online payments system.  This report analyzes PYPL's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO) and assessing its financial health.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PYPL's cumulative return of -42.77% significantly underperforms the S&P 500's 70.85% cumulative return, resulting in a substantial divergence of -113.6 percentage points.  This places it at the 6.8th percentile of the historical range (-137.5% to 212.5%), indicating significant underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance over the years. While periods of high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) are present, the recent years (2020-2025) show dramatically negative returns, exceeding -90%.  The Beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying levels of market sensitivity.  Noticeably, the Alpha values are predominantly negative in recent years, signifying underperformance compared to the market benchmark.  The market capitalization also exhibits volatility.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 68.0% | 50.0% | 40.0% | -0.1 | 72.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 47.0% | 70.6% | 29.0% | 0.0 | 83.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 62.0% | 70.6% | 31.0% | 0.6 | 107.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 128.0% | 70.6% | 100.0% | 0.4 | 231.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 65.0% | 62.0% | 7.0% | 0.4 | 186.6 |
| 2020-2022  | -90.0% | 69.2% | -98.0% | 0.3 | 70.5 |
| 2021-2023  | -247.0% | 71.5% | -0.1 | -0.1 | 60.8 |
| 2022-2024  | -117.0% | 80.0% | -0.5 | -0.5 | 84.4 |
| 2023-2025  | -38.0% | 80.0% | -1.8 | -1.8 | 60.3 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is $61.0, slightly above the previous close ($60.24).  However, all moving averages indicate a downtrend: the 5-day ($61.62), 20-day ($64.16), and 60-day ($72.20) moving averages are all above the current price.  This suggests bearish momentum.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI (42.35) is below 50, suggesting the stock is in oversold territory, but not extremely so. The PPO (0.178) is positive, indicating some bullish momentum. The recent relative divergence is positive (0.4), indicating short-term upward momentum. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.4223 falls within the Medium Risk range. The significant price change (1.26) from the previous day shows a small daily upward momentum; however, this should be considered in light of the larger downward trend.  The expected return of -981.7% is unrealistic and likely an error in the provided data.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is impossible to determine with only this data and should be evaluated through more detailed financial modeling and risk assessment.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings per share (EPS) have fluctuated recently. While actual EPS has generally exceeded expectations, the trend shows some recent declines. This requires further investigation into underlying business factors.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | EPS vs Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.19 | 1.11 | +0.08 |
| 2024-10-29 | 1.20 | 1.07 | +0.13 |
| 2024-07-30 | 1.19 | 0.99 | +0.20 |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.40 | 1.22 | +0.18 |
| 2024-02-07 | 1.48 | 1.36 | +0.12 |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, but profit margins have shown a slight downward trend in recent quarters.  ROE (Return on Equity) shows some volatility but is generally low, suggesting the company may not be using its equity as efficiently as it could.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $8.37B | 47.04% |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.85B | 46.57% |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.88B | 45.76% |
| 2024-03-31 | $7.70B | 44.95% |
| 2023-12-31 | $8.03B | 45.75% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $20.42B | 5.49% |
| 2024-09-30 | $20.17B | 5.01% |
| 2024-06-30 | $20.62B | 5.47% |
| 2024-03-31 | $20.70B | 4.29% |
| 2023-12-31 | $21.05B | 6.66% |


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

PYPL's performance has been significantly weak compared to the S&P 500 over the past few years, indicated by a large negative Alpha and substantial underperformance. While some positive short-term indicators exist (RSI nearing oversold territory, positive PPO), the long-term trend is bearish. The company's financial health, as reflected by declining profit margins and fluctuating ROE, warrants further investigation.  The significantly negative expected return should be scrutinized for accuracy.  Before making any investment decisions, a comprehensive analysis including a thorough examination of the company's future prospects and risk factors is crucial.  The data provided suggests significant risk associated with PYPL at this time.
