*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is negative for recent years, suggesting PYPL is underperforming relative to its expected return based on its beta.
*   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuate, indicating PYPL's price sensitivity to market movements changes over time, but overall indicates lower level of correlation with the market.

*   **60-day SMA:** $67.68

**Analysis:**  The stock price is below its 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), but above the 5-day SMA. This suggests a recent short-term uptrend, but the longer-term trend may still be downwards or sideways. The recent 4.24% increase indicates some upward momentum.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. There are concerns about growth and the sustainability of recent "AI bumps," but also arguments that PayPal is undervalued and poised for a rebound.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (2.45)
*   **Target Price:** $83.27 (Average)

**Analysis:**  Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating with a target price significantly above the current price. This indicates they believe the stock is undervalued and has potential for future growth. However, consider the range of target prices ($66 - $120) as there is disagreement between analysts.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

PayPal has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and its recent financial performance and market sentiment are mixed.

**Here's a summary:**

*   **Negative Factors:** Large negative divergence from the S&P 500, negative recent CAGR and Alpha values, high MDD indicating high risk and volatiltiy, concerns about growth, negative PPO, significantly negative expected return from the model, and a fall in market capitalization.
*   **Positive Factors:** Oversold RSI suggesting a potential rebound, recent positive price movement, analysts' "Buy" consensus and higher target price.

**Conclusion:**

The situation with PayPal is complex. The negative divergence, negative expected return, and concerns about growth are significant red flags. The potential for a rebound due to the oversold RSI, recent price increase, the hybrid signal, and analysts' positive outlook provide some hope.

The "Buy" rating with a much higher target price suggest the most credible outlook for PYPL is to see some recovery from the current price and continue on a moderate growth path.
