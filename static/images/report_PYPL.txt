**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**Table 2: Recent Earnings**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.19    | 1.11          |
| 2024-10-29 | 1.20    | 1.07          |

| 2024-04-30 | 1.40    | 1.22          |
| 2024-02-07 | 1.48    | 1.36          |

Generally, PYPL has exceeded earnings expectations recently. However, there's a slight downward trend in EPS from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024, potentially explaining some of the recent market downturn.  Further analysis of the earnings calls and underlying reasons for these results is needed.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Table 3: Revenue and Profitability**

| Quarter     | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $8.37       | 47.04%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $8.03       | 45.75%        |

Revenue has been relatively stable, but there's a slight decline visible. Profit margins have also shown a minor decrease over the past few quarters. This indicates some pressure on profitability, potentially impacting investor sentiment.

**Table 4: Capital and Profitability**

| Quarter     | Equity (B)  | ROE (%) |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $20.42      | 5.49    |
| 2024-09-30 | $20.17      | 5.01    |
| 2024-06-30 | $20.62      | 5.47    |
| 2024-03-31 | $20.70      | 4.29    |
| 2023-12-31 | $21.05      | 6.66    |

Equity shows some fluctuation but remains relatively stable. ROE has decreased slightly, mirroring the trend in profit margins.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500. While recent earnings have exceeded expectations, there are concerns about declining profit margins and revenue stagnation. Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the bearish momentum and negative expected return (requiring further clarification) raise caution. The high volatility and market sensitivity (high beta) make PYPL a risky investment.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy *could* potentially lead to outperformance of the S&P 500, *only if* the company successfully addresses the issues affecting its profitability and market share and reverses the current negative trend.  However, given the significant underperformance and the volatile nature of the stock, this is far from certain. Further due diligence and in-depth research are crucial before making any investment decision.  The extremely negative expected return calculation requires immediate scrutiny and validation.
