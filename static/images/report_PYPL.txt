This report analyzes PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PayPal Holdings Inc. is a multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system in the majority of countries.  The cumulative return of PYPL is 26.64%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 123.11%. The difference is -96.47%, placing it at the 6.49th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-127.39% to 348.98%).  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha and beta analysis further supports this, showing inconsistent outperformance (positive alpha) historically, and substantial underperformance in recent years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $84.67 (Last Market: $83.35)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $86.00
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $82.18
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $77.88

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating some potential support.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the last market price suggests a relatively stable day.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 61.45 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.36 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** +1.09 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates that, based on current data, no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is predicted for long-term (2+ years) buy-and-hold investors.)


The positive PPO and relative divergence support the idea of a short-term upward trend. The RSI is not offering extreme buy or sell signals. The closing price being higher than the last market price doesn't indicate a sharp rebound or drop.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The earnings show some variability. While EPS has generally been above expectations, there is a recent downward trend suggesting potential concern. The most recent earnings (Oct 29th, 2024) slightly exceeded expectations.  Consistent monitoring of earnings and guidance is crucial to gauge the company's financial health and future prospects.
