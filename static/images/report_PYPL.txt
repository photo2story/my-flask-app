**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance and risk over the years. While periods of high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) existed (e.g., 2018-2020), the recent years (2021-2025) show drastically negative returns and high MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  Beta fluctuates, suggesting variable sensitivity to market movements,  but generally high beta implies above-average market risk. The Alpha, a measure of excess return relative to the market, is mostly negative in recent years, confirming underperformance.  Note that the provided CAGR figures are concerning considering the substantial volatility and negative returns in the recent period.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $69.22

The price is above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term bearish trend.  The recent price increase of $2.14 (from $64.93) indicates a notable, positive change.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's recent performance is concerning, with a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While the company demonstrates consistent profitability and strong earnings, the stock price does not reflect these fundamentals. The extremely negative projected return (-1216.2%) needs further investigation and clarification of its calculation method.  The high negative Alpha in recent years further underlines this underperformance relative to the market.  Given the volatility and negative returns, caution is advised.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for the stock's underperformance (market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, competitive pressures) is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The extremely negative expected return warrants significant skepticism.  Investors should carefully consider the risks before investing in PYPL.
