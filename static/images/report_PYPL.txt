**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $63.95
* **5-day Moving Average:** $59.99
* **20-day Moving Average:** $66.43
* **60-day Moving Average:** $75.00

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase (Last-market) indicates a sharp rebound of 11.39. This needs further investigation to determine if it is a sustainable recovery or a temporary fluctuation.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.88 (Below 50, suggesting oversold conditions, but not necessarily a strong buy signal)
* **PPO:** -0.76 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.2 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -949.4%  This extremely negative expected return is highly concerning and needs further clarification on the calculation methodology.  It likely reflects the current underperformance and high risk assessment.

The large price change from the previous close ('Last-market') highlights a significant recent price jump. This could signal a potential short-term recovery, but it is important to monitor this trend for sustainability.  The negative expected return indicates significant risk and low confidence in future performance relative to the S&P 500.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PayPal (PYPL) presents a complex picture.  While it maintains strong revenue and profit margins, its stock performance has severely underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting negative alpha and significant volatility.  Recent earnings have been positive, surpassing expectations, yet this hasn't translated into positive stock price movement.  The high market risk indicator, negative PPO, and the extremely low expected return all point towards significant risk. The recent sharp price increase requires careful monitoring to assess its sustainability.  A long-term investment strategy should be approached with caution, considering the current underperformance and the need for substantial improvement to justify a positive outlook relative to broader market indices.  Further investigation into the -949.4% expected return calculation is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
