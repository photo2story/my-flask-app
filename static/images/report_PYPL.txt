### 7. 종합 분석

PayPal (PYPL) presents a mixed picture. On one hand:

*   **Negative Performance:** Significantly underperforming the S&P 500, with a concerningly large negative expected return.  Alpha is also significantly negative, and the relative divergence highlights the extent of this underperformance compared to its historical trends.
*   **Recent Downgrades:** Analyst downgrades raise concerns about future growth.
*   **Strong Points:** Recent earnings have consistently beat expectations.  Revenue and profit margins are relatively stable and high. The hybrid Signal recommends to buy.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Recent price action suggests short-term upward momentum. The MRI is also relatively high

**Overall:** While the analyst consensus is "Buy" and recent earnings have been positive, the severe underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative alpha, concerning expected return, and recent analyst downgrades suggest that **caution is warranted**. The MRI is not trustworthy. Investors should carefully consider these factors before making any investment decisions in PYPL. It seems that high MRI data is automatically calculated and it doesn't fully reflect the risks presented in other data. A deeper understanding of why it suggests high investment is needed.
