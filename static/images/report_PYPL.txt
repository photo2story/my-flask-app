*   **RSI:** 37.34
*   **PPO:** 0.43
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (34 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.7 (Negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -8279.5

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.9 suggests medium investment risk based on the model.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 37.34 is below 50 and approaching oversold conditions (typically below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity, but it should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.43 indicates that the shorter-term moving average is slightly above the longer-term moving average, suggesting a weak upward momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a strong "buy" signal, using all available cash to purchase shares. It also recommends a small monthly investment.  This is a strong bullish indicator from this particular model.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative divergence change suggests continued short-term downward pressure.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a huge red flag. This suggests the model predicts massive underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if invested long-term from this point. This should be investigated thoroughly!
