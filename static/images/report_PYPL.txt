## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) is a multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system.  Over the observed period, PYPL's cumulative return (24.74%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (116.17%).  The difference is -91.4%, placing it in the 7.9th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (-126.2% to 315.8%).  This indicates substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.  The alpha consistently shown as 1.0 in the provided data is questionable and needs further investigation as it suggests consistent market-level performance, which contradicts the large negative cumulative return difference from the S&P 500.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's recent performance has been disappointing, significantly lagging the S&P 500. While the company is showing positive EPS surprises and relatively stable profit margins, the substantial negative projected long-term return relative to the market is a major concern, and its validity needs further investigation.  The provided alpha values are inconsistent with the substantial underperformance. The relatively stable 5-day and 20-day moving averages suggest some short-term price recovery, but the long-term trend is negative.  A more detailed analysis is needed to ascertain the reasons behind the substantial underperformance and to assess the validity of the very negative long-term expected return estimate.  Further investigation of the alpha calculations and the methodology for the long-term expected return prediction is crucial before making any investment decisions.
