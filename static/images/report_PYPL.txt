2025-02-25 - Analysis Report
## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Report

**0) Introduction:**  PayPal Holdings Inc. is a multinational financial technology company operating a worldwide online payments system.  This report analyzes PYPL's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering various financial metrics and indicators.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

PYPL's cumulative return is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **PYPL Cumulative Return:** 5.06%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 117.02%
* **Return Difference:** -111.96%
* **Relative Divergence:** 3.2% (This means PYPL's performance relative to VOO is currently at the 3.2nd percentile of its historical range of divergence, based on the provided min and max values.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows highly volatile performance of PYPL compared to the market.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) was positive in several periods, the recent years (2021-2025) have shown dramatically negative CAGRs, coupled with significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  The high Beta values (especially in recent years)  indicate a high sensitivity to market movements, exceeding the market volatility in recent years, and exhibiting substantial underperformance compared to S&P 500. The substantial negative alpha values suggests that PYPL failed to deliver significant returns above the market expectations.  Itâ€™s important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $75.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $76.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $80.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $85.68

The stock price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price change from the previous close (+0.40) shows a slight upward movement but this needs to be considered within the broader context of the down trend indicated by the moving averages.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 20.89  (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.44 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.1 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -1457.1% (This extremely negative value suggests a significantly negative outlook over a long term. The methodology for calculating this extremely low value should be verified)
* **Price Change:** The slight positive change in price from the previous close (0.40) is not enough to suggest a significant positive shift in the downtrend, especially considering the indicators which remain negative.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.19   | 1.11          | 0.08        |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's performance has been significantly underperforming the S&P 500 in recent years, despite occasional periods of high growth.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but the bearish momentum and negative long-term expected return raise significant concerns. While recent earnings have exceeded expectations, the overall trend indicates a decline.  The financial information shows relatively stable revenue and high profit margins, but ROE has decreased.  Given the significantly negative expected return and the high volatility indicated by beta, significant caution is advised before investing in PYPL, particularly for long-term investments.  A thorough evaluation of the underlying reasons for the recent underperformance and a careful assessment of the company's future prospects are crucial before making any investment decision.  The extremely negative expected return should be critically examined and verified as it seems improbable.
