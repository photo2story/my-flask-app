## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), a leading online payments company, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) recently.  While showing periods of strong growth in the past, recent performance indicates considerable challenges.  Further analysis is needed to determine if the current valuation reflects these challenges appropriately.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. is a technology company facilitating online payments.  Its cumulative return of -43.33% significantly lags the S&P 500's 70.75% return, resulting in a substantial divergence (-114.1 points).  This places PYPL at the 6.7th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (relative divergence).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance and risk characteristics over time.  While periods of high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) are evident, the recent years have shown substantial negative returns and a sharply negative Alpha, suggesting underperformance relative to the market.  The Beta, while generally high, has also fluctuated.  The high negative Alpha in the last two years is a particular cause for concern.

| 2015-2017  | 68.0% | 50.0% | 40.0% | -0.1 | 72.8 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

PYPL's current closing price is $60.24, down $2.84 from the previous close.  The stock is trading below its 5-day ($61.53), 20-day ($64.59), and 60-day ($72.68) moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4118 suggests a medium risk level.
* **RSI:** 35.67 indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO:** 0.0948 shows a weak positive momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:**  A recent positive change of 0.4 in the 20-day relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend, however, this needs to be interpreted in light of the longer-term negative trend.
* **Expected Return:** A -994.7% expected return is highly improbable and likely indicates an error in the calculation or data input.  A long-term investment (2+ years) would need to account for market volatility and potential for recovery in order to produce an accurate forecast.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

PYPL has consistently exceeded earnings per share (EPS) expectations in recent quarters.  However, this positive surprise is insufficient to offset the significant negative trend in the stock's price.

**5. Financial Information:**

A more in-depth analysis of the financial statements is necessary to fully understand the underlying factors contributing to these trends.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PYPL's recent performance is concerning.  While earnings have exceeded expectations, the stock's significant underperformance against the S&P 500, coupled with negative Alpha and a bearish price trend, raises significant questions.  The relatively high Beta suggests sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for the company's struggles, including competitive pressures and macroeconomic factors, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The -994.7% expected return is highly suspect and requires re-evaluation. The provided data suggests a high-risk investment at present.  A thorough due diligence, incorporating fundamental and qualitative analysis, is strongly recommended.
