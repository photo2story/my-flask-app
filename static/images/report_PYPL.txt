**2) Recent Price Movement:**

The stock closed at $64.74, below its 5-day ($70.17), 20-day ($69.30), and 60-day ($78.57) moving averages. This indicates a downward trend.  The recent price drop of $0.63 suggests a mild negative trend.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.87 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** 0.81 (Positive, but needs further context for interpretation)
* **Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -873.9%  This extremely negative expected return indicates a significant risk of further losses, especially considering the already substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  A long-term investment strategy (2+ years)  should consider this high level of risk.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company consistently beat its projected EPS, showing positive surprises in earnings. However, this positive trend in EPS doesn't fully explain the significant negative price action and overall underperformance against the market.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.19 | 1.11 |

**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, with slight fluctuations quarter-over-quarter. Profit margins are healthy and consistently above 45%. ROE (Return on Equity) shows some variability, but generally remains positive.  However, the overall picture suggests a relatively stable financial position despite the poor stock performance.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $8.37B | 47.04% |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's performance is a puzzle. While the company shows consistent profitability and revenue, its stock price significantly underperforms the market. The negative expected return is alarming.  The recent price drop, coupled with bearish technical indicators (RSI below 50), suggests further downside potential in the short term. However, the relatively healthy financial fundamentals might provide some support in the longer term.  Investors should carefully consider the substantial risk involved before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance (e.g., macroeconomic factors, competitive pressures, changes in consumer behavior) is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The extreme negative expected return warrants extreme caution.
