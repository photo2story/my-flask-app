* **20-day Moving Average:** $65.79
* **60-day Moving Average:** $74.11

* **Expected Return:** -956.3% (This extremely negative figure needs further investigation and clarification.

This doesn't necessarily negate the larger bearish trend.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PYPL's performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over recent periods. While it has consistently beaten earnings expectations, this positive news has not been reflected in the stock price. Negative alpha, declining beta, and bearish technical indicators paint a concerning picture. The high market risk indicator further cautions against significant investment at this time.  The extremely negative expected return figure needs clarification.  Before considering a long-term investment (even with a dollar-cost averaging strategy), a thorough investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and a reassessment of the expected return are crucial.  Further due diligence is strongly advised before making any investment decisions.
