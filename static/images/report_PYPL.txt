## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) is a multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system.  As of the last data point, PYPL's cumulative return is 26.75%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 124.01%. The difference is -97.26%, placing it at the 6.32 percentile of the historical range of relative performance (-127.39% to 348.98%).  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market. The provided alpha and beta analysis shows considerable market-related risk (high Beta) and inconsistent outperformance (variable Alpha) over various periods.  Note that high negative alpha values in recent years denote significant underperformance against the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Price:** $84.74
* **5-day Moving Average:** $85.02
* **20-day Moving Average:** $82.53
* **60-day Moving Average:** $78.30

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term bearish trend. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend over the medium to long term.  The price is relatively close to its recent highs, leaving minimal room for further upward movement in the near term absent a new catalyst.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 65.76 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.05 (Slightly positive, suggesting mild upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +0.38 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates that, based on the available data, there is no expected outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), even with a long-term buy-and-hold strategy.)


The RSI is nearing overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction. The PPO confirms mild upward momentum but is not overwhelmingly bullish. The 20-day relative divergence confirms recent short-term gains.  The fact the current price is relatively high considering recent movements does not suggest a dramatic upward or downward trend is imminent.

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Actual vs Expected |

| 2023-11-01 | 1.3     | 1.22         | +0.08 (Over-performed) |

Recent earnings have consistently exceeded expectations.  However, this alone is not sufficient evidence to predict future performance.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity levels are substantial and fairly consistent; ROE shows some fluctuation, reflecting the ups and downs of the company performance.  These figures, while positive, do not guarantee future success and must be considered alongside other factors.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, showing a large negative alpha. While recent earnings have exceeded expectations, the stock is approaching overbought territory (RSI) and the expected long-term return against the market is low.  Technical indicators suggest potential short-term consolidation or minor correction.  Long-term investment requires careful consideration of market risks (high beta) and the company's ability to sustain its recent earnings performance and to improve its market standing relative to the broader market.  A more comprehensive analysis requires reviewing recent news and analyst sentiment to assess potential catalysts impacting future stock performance.
