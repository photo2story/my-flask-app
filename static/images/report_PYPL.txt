## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. is a multinational financial technology company that facilitates online payments and money transfers.  This report analyzes PYPL's recent performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), incorporating key financial metrics and indicators.


**1) Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

PYPL's cumulative return is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500.  The provided data shows:

* **PYPL Cumulative Return:** -39.99%

The data shows high volatility in CAGR and a significant increase in Beta in recent years, suggesting increased sensitivity to market movements.  The negative Alpha in the most recent period (2023-2025) highlights significant underperformance relative to the market.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $58.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $63.72
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $67.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $76.26

The price is significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The relatively large negative daily change (-5.41) suggests a recent sharp decline.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 21.97 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.91 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.8 (Short-term upward movement, but context is needed to ascertain significance).
* **Expected Return:** -863.1% (This extremely negative figure suggests a significant risk and warrants further investigation of its calculation methodology.  It's likely flawed or requires significant context.)

The technical indicators point to a bearish market sentiment. The RSI suggests the stock is oversold, but this doesn't guarantee a rebound. The extremely negative expected return needs clarification.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.19   | 1.11           |

| 2024-02-07 | 1.48   | 1.36           |

EPS has consistently exceeded expectations, but the overall trend may reflect a slowdown.  Further analysis is needed to determine if the positive EPS surprises are sufficient to offset the negative market sentiment.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PYPL has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, as shown by its negative cumulative return and considerably negative alpha.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish market sentiment, and the stock price is below key moving averages.  While recent earnings have exceeded expectations, the overall picture reflects a concerning performance, especially when combined with the high beta and extremely negative (and likely flawed) expected return.  A long-term investment strategy requires careful consideration of the risks and potential for a significant market recovery. The extremely negative expected return requires investigation of its calculation method.  The relatively stable financials provide some comfort, but the overall performance warrants caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the significant underperformance is recommended before making any investment decisions.
