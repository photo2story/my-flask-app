*   **Relative Divergence Change:**  The positive change indicates that PYPL's performance relative to the S&P 500 has improved slightly recently.

This suggests that, despite the recent small improvement and "buy" signal, the model projects very poor long-term performance relative to the S&P 500. This number is unusually extreme and warrants careful scrutiny.

### 7. 종합 Summary

PYPL has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While recent earnings have been positive, and analysts have a "Buy" consensus, several warning signs exist. The dramatically negative expected return, the large recent price drop, and uncertainties surrounding future regulation suggest caution is warranted.  The high MRI and "Buy" hybrid signal contrast sharply with the negative long-term expected return, indicating potential model conflict or unique risk factors not captured by the MRI. A deeper investigation into the drivers behind the negative expected return is essential.
