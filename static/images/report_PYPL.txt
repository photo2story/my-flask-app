The negative Alpha, Beta and substantial negative expected return are major concerns, implying potentially significant long-term underperformance.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Underperformance:** The substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is a critical issue.
*   **Volatility:** The recent news suggests increased volatility.
*   **Technical Indicators:** RSI approaching oversold might offer a short-term opportunity, but the negative PPO and Hybrid signal suggest caution.
*   **Long-Term Outlook:** The highly negative expected return necessitates a careful reevaluation of the company's long-term prospects.

**Recommendation:**

Given the significant underperformance, negative expected return, and the cautious Hybrid Signal, a **cautious approach** is warranted. Investors should closely monitor upcoming news, analyst reports, and company announcements before making any investment decisions.
