    *   **Analyst Target Prices:** The average target price is significantly above the current price, but this should be viewed with caution given the company's recent performance. A range of $51.00 to $120.00 indicates high uncertainty.
*   **Recommendation:** Based on the data provided, a **HOLD** or even a **SELL** recommendation would be warranted for risk-averse investors. The negative trend is strong, and the extremely negative expected return is concerning. For investors considering a BUY position, **caution is strongly advised**. It's important to deeply research PayPal's long-term growth prospects, understand the challenges it faces, and carefully consider the risks before investing. Pay close attention to what is driving the negative expected return as this is key. The analyst consensus is currently a "Hold," but it's crucial to remember that analyst opinions are not always accurate. The recent news highlights ongoing debates about the company's future. Further investigate why MRI is 1.0 when all other factors point to the stock being far from the high investment category.
