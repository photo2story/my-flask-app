**6. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period, showing a substantial negative return. While recent earnings have beaten expectations, the overall trend shows declining CAGR and increasing negative Alpha.  Technical indicators suggest a downtrend, although the RSI is not deeply oversold.  The financial statements reveal relatively stable revenue but some decline in profitability metrics.  The extremely negative expected return (-858%) needs clarification; it's likely an error.  A long-term investment strategy in PYPL would need to carefully consider the risks associated with its significant underperformance compared to the broad market.  Further investigation is required to understand the drivers of the substantial negative return and assess the long-term prospects for recovery.  The -858% expected return is highly suspect and should be disregarded without further explanation or validation from the source.
