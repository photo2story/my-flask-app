    *   Alpha is negative for recent periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market. Beta is also low.
    *   The negative performance has dramatically reduced PayPal's capitalization.

**2.  Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Analysis:** The stock price has decreased recently, as indicated by the negative change from the previous close. The shorter-term moving averages (5-day and 20-day) are below the longer-term 60-day moving average, suggesting a downward trend.

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** "단기상승" (Short-term increase) suggests the divergence between PYPL and VOO has improved slightly recently.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-8288.1%) is highly unusual and suggests a serious problem in the model used to calculate it. *This should be considered an outlier and treated with extreme caution.*

**4.  Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Recent Downgrades:** The absence of indicated change is notable, but not an indicator of stability due to recent downgrades.

**5.  Comprehensive Analysis:**

PayPal is currently facing significant challenges, as evidenced by its underperformance relative to the S&P 500, recent stock price declines, and analyst downgrades. However, the company is also taking steps to address these challenges, such as seeking a bank charter and launching PayPal Bank.

**Key Takeaways and Concerns:**

*   **Underperformance:**  PayPal's recent performance is very concerning, significantly lagging the overall market.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** The "Hold" consensus and recent downgrades reflect a lack of confidence in the company's near-term prospects.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The massive negative expected return is a red flag, suggesting serious doubts about long-term value (although the specific calculation method should be scrutinized).
*   **Silver Lining (Potentially):** The RSI suggests the stock is nearing oversold conditions, potentially indicating a buying opportunity for contrarian investors *if* the company can turn things around.
*   **Bank Charter Ambiguity:** The news about PayPal seeking a bank charter is a double-edged sword. It could be positive in the long run, but it also introduces regulatory uncertainty and integration challenges.

**Overall Conclusion:**

PayPal is a high-risk investment at the moment. While the MRI indicates medium investment risk, the significant underperformance, negative momentum, and analyst downgrades suggest caution. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in PayPal. The launch of PayPal Bank and the potential impact of a bank charter are key developments to watch. **It is crucial to understand the methodology behind the extremely negative expected return and verify its accuracy before making any investment decisions based on that figure.**
