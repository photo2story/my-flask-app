## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Review

This report analyzes PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), a leading online payments system, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PayPal's cumulative return (31.28%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's (126.64%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -95.36%, placing it at the 6.72 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. This indicates a substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha and beta values across several years show periods of outperformance (high alpha) but ultimately reveal a considerable lag behind the market index, especially recently.  The consistently high beta (>1) reflects substantial market volatility.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $87.77 (Last market: $87.09)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $85.64
* **20-day Moving Average:** $83.17
* **60-day Moving Average:** $79.02

The price is above all moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, but the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day MA indicates a relatively flat recent trend. The gap between the 5-day and 60-day MA suggests a recent price increase following a period of lower activity.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (76.23):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (0.15):** A positive value suggests a bullish trend, but it's relatively modest.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (0.14):**  Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The projected long-term (2+ years) excess return relative to the S&P 500 is zero. This reflects the historical underperformance and uncertainty about future returns.  The substantial negative delta in the previous analysis suggests a downward trend.  An increase from 87.09 to 87.77 isn't enough to indicate a significant rebound (although potentially a short-lived one).
