* **60-Day Moving Average:** $84.10

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price decline of -3.26% suggests a short-term bearish trend.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.93 (Indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Short-term bearish trend confirmed.)

The extremely negative expected return is concerning and warrants further investigation into the methodology used to calculate it. The oversold RSI may signal a potential bounce, but the negative PPO and moving averages point to a prevailing bearish sentiment.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PYPL's significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern. While recent earnings have exceeded expectations, the stock price is heavily influenced by broader market sentiment and investor concerns about future growth. The extremely negative expected return figure, however, needs to be reviewed and verified. The high beta indicates significant market risk.  Further investigation into the factors driving the negative expected return and the overall market sentiment towards PYPL is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The current technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, though the oversold RSI might indicate a potential short-term rebound.  Long-term investors should carefully weigh the risks associated with PYPL's significant underperformance against its potential for future growth.
