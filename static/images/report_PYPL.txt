The data shows significant volatility in CAGR and a negative alpha in recent years, suggesting underperformance compared to the benchmark.  Beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.  Note the extremely high negative values for CAGR and Alpha in the most recent periods; these should be treated cautiously without further investigation into the underlying causes for these extreme values.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $65.34
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $62.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $69.99

The closing price is above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent short-term upward trend. However, it remains below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.  The price increase of $0.88 from the previous close suggests a potential short-term upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 65.75 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.22 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -1.0 (Short-term bearish)
* **Expected Return:** -1186.3% (This extremely negative figure requires further investigation and context. It's likely not a realistic prediction.)

The mixed signals from the technical indicators suggest uncertainty. While the PPO is positive, the RSI is approaching overbought levels, and the negative relative divergence change hints at a potential short-term pullback.  The extremely high negative expected return (-1186.3%) is likely an error in the calculation or data input and should be disregarded without additional clarification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PayPal's stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, indicated by a large negative cumulative return.  While recent earnings have been positive,  the stock price shows signs of both short-term upward momentum and longer-term downward trends.  Technical indicators offer mixed signals.  The extremely high negative expected return value is likely an error and should be ignored.  A comprehensive analysis requires further investigation into the reasons for the substantial underperformance and the extreme values observed in several metrics, as well as a consideration of macroeconomic factors and industry trends.  The significant volatility and negative alpha suggest caution, and investors should carefully weigh the risks before investing.
