**1. Performance Analysis:**

PayPal Holdings Inc. is a multinational financial technology company operating an online payments system.  Over the past period, PYPL has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return of only 6.93% compared to VOO's 121.58%.  This represents a substantial lag of -114.6%. The provided relative divergence data suggests that while this underperformance is considerable, it's not an unprecedented outlier in the historical context of PYPL's performance relative to the S&P 500.

The alpha and beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance. While high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) was observed in some periods (e.g., 178% from 2018-2020),  recent years show significantly negative returns, suggesting volatility and challenges for the company.  The increasing Beta in recent years also indicates growing sensitivity to market fluctuations.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $76.59
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $76.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $84.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $86.48

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price increase from the previous close is minor and doesn't significantly alter the overall downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (24.93):**  Indicates oversold conditions, potentially suggesting a bounce is due. However, this should be interpreted cautiously.
* **PPO (-1.41):**  Confirms bearish momentum, aligning with the price action.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-0.9):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (-1742.6%):**  This extremely negative expected return suggests a highly pessimistic outlook for PYPL's future performance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) horizon.  This figure warrants careful scrutiny and further investigation into its underlying assumptions.  The current minor price increase needs to be seen in the context of this long-term bearish prediction.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|---------|---------------|------------|

| 2024-02-07 | 1.48    | 1.36          | Beat       |

PayPal has consistently beat earnings expectations in recent quarters.  However, this positive trend must be considered within the context of the overall negative performance and forecast.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PYPL's performance has been significantly below the S&P 500, and the -1742.6% projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is a serious concern. While recent earnings have beaten expectations and financial metrics (revenue and profit margins) are relatively stable, the negative price trend, bearish technical indicators, and the dramatically negative long-term return projection paint a cautious picture.  The high volatility and sensitivity to market shifts (high beta) add to the risk.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the poor relative performance and the methodology behind the -1742.6% expected return figure are crucial before making any investment decisions.  Investors should proceed with caution and consider diversifying their portfolio.
