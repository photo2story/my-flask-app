## PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL), a leading technology platform and digital payments company, based on the provided data.  We will examine its performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key indicators, earnings, and financial information.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

PayPal's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's.  The difference is substantial:

* **PYPL Cumulative Return:** -1.25%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 112.61%
* **Return Difference:** -113.9%

The relative divergence of -113.9% puts PYPL at the 2.8th percentile of its historical range against the VOO (-126.2% to 315.8%).  This indicates significant underperformance compared to the broader market.  The alpha and beta analysis further illustrates this point.  While CAGR was high in some periods (notably 2018-2020),  the recent years (2021-2025) show extremely negative returns and a high beta, suggesting significant sensitivity to market fluctuations and overall poor performance.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

PYPL's recent price action shows a downtrend:

* **Closing Price:** $70.73
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $73.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $78.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $84.94

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting further downside potential. The price decreased by $1.83 from the previous closing price, indicating a recent drop.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (24.07):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.75):**  Negative value signals bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-0.1):**  Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-1705.9%):** This extremely negative figure suggests significantly lower returns than the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  It implies substantial risk, and the extremely negative value might be an error in data or calculation.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-02-04 | 1.19   | 1.11           |
| 2024-10-29 | 1.20   | 1.07           |
| 2024-07-30 | 1.19   | 0.99           |
| 2024-04-30 | 1.40   | 1.22           |
| 2024-02-07 | 1.48   | 1.36           |

While recent EPS has generally exceeded expectations, the overall trend does not appear to justify the extremely negative expected return calculated in section 3.  Further investigation into the calculation of the expected return is needed.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, while profit margins show a slight downward trend.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $8.37B | 47.04% |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.85B | 46.57% |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.88B | 45.76% |
| 2024-03-31 | $7.70B | 44.95% |
| 2023-12-31 | $8.03B | 45.75% |

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable, but ROE fluctuates.

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $20.42B | 5.49% |
| 2024-09-30 | $20.17B | 5.01% |
| 2024-06-30 | $20.62B | 5.47% |
| 2024-03-31 | $20.70B | 4.29% |
| 2023-12-31 | $21.05B | 6.66% |


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

PYPL's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, exhibiting considerable negative returns in recent years, and a high beta reflecting market sensitivity. While some technical indicators (RSI) suggest potential for a short-term bounce, the overall trend is bearish. The negative expected return (-1705.9%) requires further verification.  Despite relatively stable revenue and reasonably high profit margins, the overall financial picture is not strong enough to overcome the significantly negative return relative to the market.  Caution is advised before considering investment in PYPL.  A thorough review of the methodology used to calculate the expected return is crucial.
