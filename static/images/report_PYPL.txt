* **20-Day Moving Average:** $85.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $80.98

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** 0.05 – A positive value suggests a bullish momentum, albeit weak.

The 89.04 price doesn't indicate any significant recent jump or drop, given the context of the long-term underperformance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL has shown consistent EPS beats in recent quarters, maintaining high profit margins. However, the stock significantly underperforms the S&P 500. Technical indicators show a neutral to slightly positive short-term outlook, but the long-term outlook is weak, especially compared to the market benchmark.  The lack of recent news and details on revenue growth trends limits a full analysis.  Significant negative alpha values over recent years strongly indicate underperformance relative to market expectations.  Further investigation into the reasons for this underperformance (e.g., market factors, competitive pressures, internal company issues) is needed before making any investment decisions.


**8.  Investment Recommendation:**

Based solely on the provided data,  a long-term investment in PYPL carries significant risk given its substantial underperformance against the S&P 500.  The consistent EPS beats are positive, but the overall negative trend needs to be carefully considered alongside additional research into the factors driving the performance discrepancy.  A more comprehensive analysis, including detailed revenue data, market analysis, and further news and analyst assessments, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
