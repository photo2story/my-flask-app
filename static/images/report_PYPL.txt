**6) Overall Analysis:**

PYPL is currently experiencing significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, reflected in its negative cumulative return and negative alpha.  While recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations, the stock price remains significantly below its moving averages. The high market risk indicator and low RSI suggest high volatility and potential for a price rebound. However, the negative PPO and the extremely negative expected return (-761.9%, needs further clarification)  indicate a bearish outlook.  A long-term investment strategy would require careful consideration of the substantial risks associated with the stock's volatility and poor recent performance relative to the market.  The recent price jump might be a short-term bounce, and further analysis is needed before making any investment decisions.  The -761.9% expected return figure requires clarification and possibly correction.
