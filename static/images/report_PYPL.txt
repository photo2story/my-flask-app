**Conclusion:**

While the analyst consensus is positive, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the negative long-term expected return warrant caution. The recent price drop and the stock trading below its moving averages suggest a downtrend. Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before considering an investment in PYPL.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative expected return and the factors contributing to the underperformance is recommended. The MRI and hybrid signal also suggests the investment may not be very risky. The analyst data, news, and indicators provide conflicting information and requires additional research.
