**6. Overall Analysis:**

PYPL's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, exhibiting negative alpha and high beta in recent periods. While recent earnings have beaten expectations,  revenue growth is relatively flat and profit margins are slightly declining.  The price is currently below its moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The extremely negative expected return needs to be investigated for potential errors.  A thorough fundamental analysis considering macroeconomic factors, competition, and PYPL's strategic initiatives is necessary to evaluate its long-term prospects. The data provided suggests caution, and a long-term investment decision requires additional research and careful consideration of the risks involved.  The highly negative expected return is a major red flag and requires immediate clarification.
