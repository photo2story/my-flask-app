**Performance Analysis:**

The provided data shows Innodata Inc. (INOD) significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return of INOD is drastically higher than VOO. However, it's crucial to understand that past performance is not indicative of future results. The high relative divergence (100%) suggests INOD has been exceptionally strong relative to the market in the past, but this extreme deviation from the benchmark warrants caution.  Sustaining such high growth is highly unlikely.

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) data reveal significant volatility.  Early years show negative CAGRs, indicating periods of underperformance.  However,  the more recent years exhibit incredibly high CAGRs,  accompanied by substantial MDDs, highlighting the risk associated with INOD's investment.  The Alpha and Beta values fluctuate significantly, further suggesting substantial volatility and a lack of consistent market correlation. The sharply increasing beta in the latest years is notable and indicates growing correlation with overall market movements.  This suggests increased systemic risk.

**Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $61.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $57.58
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $44.15
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $41.42

The price shows a recent sharp increase (13.47% from the previous close). The price is significantly above all three moving averages, suggesting a strong upward trend in the short term.

**Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 81.71  This suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating a potential correction might be imminent.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 4.33 A positive PPO value suggests a bullish trend, though the magnitude needs further context within historical PPO values for a conclusive interpretation.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.0 (-)  This indicates a recent short-term decline in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 48.4% This is a substantial expected excess return compared to the S&P 500.  However, this projection is extremely sensitive to the volatility of INOD, and the reliability of such a high forecast must be questioned. The likelihood of a 48.4% return significantly exceeds the risk-adjusted expected return of most investment strategies and warrants critical scrutiny.

**Risk Assessment:**

The extraordinarily high cumulative return, volatile CAGR and MDD, overbought RSI, and extremely high projected return all point to a highly risky investment.  While the potential upside is significant, the chance of substantial losses is equally significant.  The recent sharp price increase (a 13.47% increase in one day) further highlights the volatility and inherent risk of this stock.  Any investment decision should carefully consider risk tolerance and diversification.
