**Performance Analysis:**

Innodata Inc. (INOD) has exhibited extraordinary performance, significantly outpacing the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return of 2092.06% dwarfs the S&P 500's 121.84%, resulting in a massive divergence.  The relative divergence of 100% highlights that this outperformance is exceptionally high compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests a potential period of extreme growth.  However, such extreme returns are usually unsustainable in the long term and warrant caution.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta values show a significant shift over time.  Initially, INOD exhibited low or negative alpha and near-zero beta, suggesting little correlation with the market. However, from 2018 onwards, alpha increases dramatically, showing substantial outperformance.  The rising beta suggests increasing market correlation.  The high CAGR figures in later years further corroborate the exceptional return but also highlight the high risk associated with this investment.  The significant Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values also confirm this high risk profile.

**Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price action shows a sharp upward trend. The current price is above all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting strong bullish momentum. The significant price increase from the previous close ($2.96) indicates a notable upward jump â€“ this should be considered as a potential reason for this analysis.

**Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 69.63 is approaching the overbought level (typically considered 70 or above), suggesting potential short-term price correction. The positive PPO (3.42) confirms the bullish momentum. The significant positive relative divergence indicates a strengthening short-term upward trend.

**Risk and Outlook:**

While INOD's performance has been exceptional, investors should exercise caution.  The high relative divergence, approaching overbought RSI, and past periods of significant drawdowns highlight the inherent risk.  The expected long-term return of 47.6% over the S&P 500 is promising, but it's crucial to understand that this projection is based on historical data and may not reflect future performance.  Further fundamental analysis is necessary to assess the sustainability of INOD's growth and associated risk. The recent sharp price increase warrants further investigation into the underlying cause.
