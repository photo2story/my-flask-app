## BlackRock Inc. (BLK) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes BlackRock Inc. (BLK), a leading global asset management firm, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

BlackRock's cumulative return (139.36%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.73%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 18.6%, placing it at the 55.6th percentile of the historical range of the difference between BLK and VOO's returns (max: 52.4%, min: -23.8%).  This suggests BLK has generally outperformed the market benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $1046.38
* **5-day Moving Average:** $1039.56
* **20-day Moving Average:** $1031.23
* **60-day Moving Average:** $987.60

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively close proximity of the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates relatively strong upward momentum. The last market price of $1047.17 is only slightly higher than the closing price and does not indicate a significant, sudden price jump or drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (50.77):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (-0.0362):** Slightly negative, suggesting weak momentum, though it's close to neutral.
* **20-day Relative Strength Change (+8.7):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (-3.4%):**  The provided expected return of -3.4% suggests a potential underperformance relative to expectations, although this might be short-term and not reflect the long-term outlook (especially if considering a long-term investment strategy).

The provided data does not offer enough information to explain any discrepancy between the significantly positive cumulative return and this slightly negative expected return. Further analysis would be required.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue:

* **EPS:** Fluctuated between $9.13 and $10.75 over the reported quarters.  No consistent upward or downward trend is readily apparent.
* **Revenue:** Showed some quarter-to-quarter variation, but generally displays modest growth over the period.  There's no clear consistent growth pattern.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Information on market outlook is absent.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BlackRock (BLK) demonstrates strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by both the high cumulative return and the consistently positive alpha in the provided data.  Recent price action suggests a short-term upward trend, supported by the moving averages.  While technical indicators show a neutral to slightly negative short-term momentum, the longer-term performance is strong. The provided earnings data shows some volatility but overall suggests a healthy and generally growing company. However, the -3.4% expected return requires further investigation to reconcile with the observed long-term outperformance.  More current news and analyst sentiment data would provide a more complete picture. A long-term investment strategy might still be favorable based on BLK's historical performance and relatively stable financial standing.
