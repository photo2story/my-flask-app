**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

BlackRock Inc. (BLK) is a global investment management corporation.  The provided data shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **BLK Cumulative Return:** 128.15%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 120.63%
* **Return Difference:** 7.52%

The provided data indicates BLK's cumulative return exceeds that of the S&P 500 by 7.52%.  The relative divergence of 41.4% suggests that this outperformance is relatively high compared to historical fluctuations.  However, this is just a snapshot; long-term analysis is crucial to evaluate the true performance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta values reveal BLK's performance relative to the market. High alpha values (above 1) suggest outperformance, while beta indicates the stock's volatility relative to the market (beta > 1 means higher volatility).  The data shows fluctuating alpha and beta across different periods, signifying varying levels of risk and return. Noteworthy is the significant increase in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) between 2019-2021, and the sizable market capitalization increase during these same years.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $1006.62
* **Last Market Price:** $998.66
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $1025.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $1013.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $1026.91

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. The recent closing price drop (approximately -$0.79) is notable.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.32 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 3.8% (above S&P 500)

The technical indicators show mixed signals. While the RSI is near the neutral zone, the negative PPO and significant negative change in relative divergence suggest bearish short-term momentum. However, the long-term expected return of 3.8% above the S&P 500 indicates potential for long-term growth.
