**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR fluctuates significantly, indicating periods of high growth and periods of contraction. Recent periods show lower growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD values suggest significant potential losses from peak to trough. The consistent high MDD values are concerning.

*   **Beta:**  Beta values vary, indicating BLK's sensitivity to market movements.  The recent increases in Beta suggest a higher correlation and sensitivity to the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization shows an overall upward trend, reflecting growth in the company's value, but this doesn't necessarily translate to strong shareholder returns, as seen in the Alpha and Return analysis.
