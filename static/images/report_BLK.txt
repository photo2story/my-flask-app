Here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided information on BlackRock (BLK) stock:

**0) Simple Numbers and Analysis**

First, let's restate the core data for clarity:

*   **Company:** BlackRock Inc (BLK) - A global investment management corporation.
*   **BLK Cumulative Return:** 47.63%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 94.64%
*   **Divergence (BLK - VOO):** -47.0% (Relative Divergence: 1.6%)
*   **Current Price:** \$1014.72
*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **Expected Return:** -556.0%

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.59)
*   **Target Price (Avg/High/Low):** $1334 / $1486 / $1170

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):** BLK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. The divergence is -47.0%, meaning BLK's return is 47 percentage points lower than VOO's. The relative divergence of 1.6% suggests the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range. This indicates that the underperformance may be at a local extreme.
*   **BlackRock Inc:** A global investment management corporation.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis Interpretation:**

    *   **Inconsistent Performance:** The Alpha/Beta data is inconsistent and somewhat contradictory. The negative Beta values combined with high MDD do not correlate with reality.
    *   **Alpha Variation:** Alpha fluctuates significantly. Periods with positive Alpha (2015-2017, 2019-2021, 2021-2023, 2022-2024) indicate BLK outperformed its expected return based on market movements. Negative Alpha periods (especially 2023-2025) suggest underperformance.
    *   **Beta Instability:** As mentioned above, the data on Beta is inconsistent. In theory, this measures BLK's volatility relative to the market. A Beta near 1 would suggest similar volatility to the market, while values above/below suggest more/less volatility.
    *   **Capital Under Management:** The "Cap(B)" column shows BlackRock's assets under management (AUM) in billions. AUM generally trended upwards but dipped between 2020 and 2022.
    *   **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** Consistently high MDD across all periods is concerning. It shows that BlackRock's price has significantly dropped from peak to trough throughout the year.

**2) Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** \$1014.72
*   **Last Market Price:** \$1014.72, Previous Close: \$992.52, Change: 2.24%
*   **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**
    *   5-day SMA: 1012.97
    *   20-day SMA: 1067.76
    *   60-day SMA: 1115.96

*   **Interpretation:**
    *   The price is above the 5-day SMA, suggesting a short-term upward trend.
    *   The price is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating that the short-term trend is below the medium and long-term trends.
    *   The SMAs suggest a recent downtrend, with the 5-day SMA closest to the current price.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended). This suggests a reasonable level of risk for investment.
*   **RSI:** 33.57. An RSI below 30 is often considered oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:** -0.64. A negative PPO suggests a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" indicates a strong buy signal based on the system. This is supported by the MRI of 0.90.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.7 (short-term decline). The negative value indicates the relative divergence has decreased recently.
*   **Price Change:** {'price': 1014.72, 'previousClose': 992.52, 'change': 2.24} large price movements can signal volatility and potential instability.
*   **Expected Return:** -556.0%. This is extremely negative and highly unusual. The model projects substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. *This is a strong warning sign and should be investigated thoroughly.*
