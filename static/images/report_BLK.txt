## BlackRock Inc. (BLK) Investment Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

BlackRock Inc. (BLK) is a global investment management corporation.  As of the last data point, BLK's cumulative return is 143.11%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 130.06%.  This represents a difference of 13.05%.  The provided relative divergence of 48.6% indicates BLK's performance has been significantly above the S&P 500 over a historical period, but that this recent 13.05% outperformance is relatively moderate within the historical context of the data set (range between -25.1% to 53.5%).

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows consistent positive alpha (0.3) across various periods, indicating BLK has consistently outperformed the market.  Beta values (mostly around 0.7) suggest BLK's price movements are less volatile than the overall market, which is expected given its large cap and established position.  Market capitalization has steadily increased over time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $1022.80 (Last Market: $1025.82)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $1027.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $1028.96
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $976.29

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term.  The closing price is very close to the last market price indicating relatively stable price action recently.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (42.76):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce. However, it's still above the 30 level, not indicating a strong buy signal.
* **PPO (-0.46):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (NaN):**  The missing data prevents a conclusive analysis of short-term relative strength compared to the benchmark.  Further data is needed.
* **Expected Return (-4.5%):** A negative expected return suggests a potential downside risk at the current price, relative to the predicted S&P500 performance. This, however, is only the expected return at the current moment and should be reviewed alongside further analysis and forecasts.  The long-term (2+ years) outlook relative to the S&P 500 needs further clarification beyond the provided -4.5% figure.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue generally displays growth over time with a small drop in the latest quarter (2024-08-06).
* **EPS:** EPS shows some fluctuation, with a slight decrease from the peak in 2024-05-07 to the most recent report.  The duplicate entry for 2024-08-06 requires clarification to understand whether it's an error in reporting.
* **Notable Beats/Misses:** Without expectations data, it's impossible to determine whether results beat or missed expectations.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows consistent quarter-over-quarter growth. Profit margins are relatively stable and high, hovering around 47%.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has steadily increased. ROE fluctuates, with some quarters demonstrating higher returns than others.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the past two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to provide a comprehensive analysis.  This data was not included in your request.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BLK has historically outperformed the S&P 500, displaying consistent positive alpha. However, recent price action shows a downward trend, supported by a negative PPO and RSI suggesting an approaching oversold condition, but not at a strong buy signal threshold. While the financial statements point to healthy revenue growth and stable profitability, recent EPS has shown some fluctuation.  The missing data on relative divergence, expected return clarity, and current market sentiment hinders a fully comprehensive evaluation.  Further analysis, including missing information from sections 6 (news and recent issues) and clarifying the duplicate entry in the earnings data, is crucial before drawing definitive conclusions.  The potential long-term upside, relative to the S&P 500, is promising if the -4.5% expected return figure is a current snapshot and not a long-term projection.
