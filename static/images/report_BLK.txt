## BlackRock Inc. (BLK) Stock Performance Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes the performance of BlackRock Inc. (BLK), a global investment management corporation, comparing its returns to the S&P 500 (VOO) over several timeframes.  We will examine its recent price movements, technical indicators, earnings, and financial information to assess its overall performance and potential.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

BlackRock Inc. (BLK) has demonstrated significantly higher cumulative returns than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows BLK with a cumulative return of 114.81%, while VOO achieved 108.99%. This results in a positive return differential of 5.82%.  Considering the historical range of the relative divergence (max: 52.2, min: -24.1), BLK’s current relative divergence of 39.2% indicates that its outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this does not guarantee future performance.

The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals consistent outperformance (positive Alpha) relative to the market (Beta > 1) across multiple years, although there's fluctuation.  High Beta indicates higher volatility compared to the market.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

BLK has historically outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating strong alpha and high beta. Recent price action shows a short-term decline, but technical indicators suggest potential for a rebound.  While the company shows strong profitability and growing revenue, recent earnings show some volatility. Long-term investors might consider BLK, given the historical outperformance and positive expected return relative to the S&P 500; however, the recent downward trend and market volatility should be carefully considered.  Further research is necessary to fully understand the causes of EPS fluctuations and to assess the sustainability of long-term growth.  It’s vital to conduct more in-depth analysis including competitor analysis and macro-economic factors before making investment decisions.
