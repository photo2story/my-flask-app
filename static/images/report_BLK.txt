The current closing price is $875.78.  The stock is trading below its 5-day ($879.75), 20-day ($906.10), and 60-day ($952.07) moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.16 from the previous close indicates a minor positive change, but still within a broader bearish trend judging by moving average relationships.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.4244 suggests a low to medium risk level.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 39.91 indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.

* **Relative Divergence:** A positive change of 4.3 over 20 days points to a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** A 1.8% expected return is provided, but further clarification on its calculation methodology is needed. The projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500 requires additional details.  The small price change of $1.16 does not indicate a significant price shift or rapid movement (no dramatic jump or drop).

**6) Overall Analysis:**

BlackRock (BLK) shows strong historical performance, consistently outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, the relatively low RSI and positive short-term relative divergence may indicate a near-term rebound.  The company exhibits healthy revenue growth and stable profit margins. However, the provided data lacks context in several areas (e.g., methodology for expected return, complete earnings data). Further investigation and a more comprehensive analysis, including consideration of macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape, are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate data entry needs to be corrected before comprehensive analysis can be completed.
