The cumulative return of BLK is 128.84%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 118.37%.  This results in a difference of 10.47%.  The provided relative divergence of 45.3% indicates that BLK's performance relative to the S&P 500 is currently above the 45th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.

Alpha (outperformance relative to the market) consistently hovers around 0.4, implying consistent outperformance albeit with varying degrees. Beta (market sensitivity) is consistently around 0.4  which is considerably less than 1, indicating lower volatility than the overall market.  However, CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) fluctuate significantly, highlighting the volatility of returns.  Note that the consistent Beta of 0.4 might be due to a smoothing or averaging effect in the calculation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $1004.96
* **5-day Moving Average:** $986.41
* **20-day Moving Average:** $1010.82
* **60-day Moving Average:** $1018.28

The current price is slightly below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, it is above the 5-day average, which may be due to recent short-term volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 37.77 - This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price increase.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.15 - A negative value suggests bearish momentum.

* **Recent Relative Divergence:**  A positive change of +6.6% over the past 20 days points to recent short-term upward momentum.  However, combining with the negative PPO suggests potential short-term conflict in the signals.

* **Expected Return:** 3.9% - This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) horizon, assuming continued investment.  Given the current price is near or slightly below recent moving averages, it's slightly conservative.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BLK shows a long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, short-term indicators are mixed, with some suggesting potential upward movement (RSI, recent relative divergence), while others point towards bearish momentum (PPO, price below moving averages). The company demonstrates healthy financial performance, with consistent revenue and profitability.  The expected return of 3.9% over the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon is positive.  However, the volatility observed in earnings and the mixed short-term indicators suggest a need for careful consideration before investment. Further investigation into the reasons for EPS fluctuation and a more detailed analysis of the financial statements are recommended.
