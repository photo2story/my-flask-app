**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different years.  High alpha values (e.g., 2.5 in 2019-2021) indicate periods of significant outperformance compared to the market benchmark. Lower or negative alpha values suggest underperformance.  Beta values consistently exceed 1, indicating higher volatility than the overall market.  Note the significant changes in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the years.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2015-2017  | 53.0% | 51.5% | 23.0% | 0.2 | 66.2 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($889.95) is below all three moving averages (5-day: $868.06, 20-day: $918.10, 60-day: $958.35), suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price change (+1.27%) indicates a slight upward movement, but it needs to be considered in the context of longer-term trends.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI (37.86) is below 40, potentially indicating oversold conditions.  The negative PPO (-0.36) suggests bearish momentum. The recent relative divergence shows short-term upward movement.  The MRI (0.4585) suggests high market risk.  The expected return of -5.1% versus the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) indicates potential underperformance.  The recent price increase of 1.27% is a relatively small positive change and does not represent a significant rebound.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings data shows some variability in EPS and revenue.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying trends.  There is also a duplication of data for 2024-08-06.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BlackRock (BLK) shows slightly lower returns compared to the S&P 500 over the observed period. While recent price action suggests a potential short-term upward trend, the stock is currently trading below its moving averages, and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend and potential oversold conditions.  Long-term projections suggest underperformance versus the market.  A deeper dive into the earnings data and financial statements is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.  The high market risk indicator warrants caution.  Given the data, a long-term investment strategy requires careful consideration of the potential risks and the relatively low predicted long-term returns compared to the S&P 500.  Further analysis of industry trends and competitive landscape would be beneficial.
