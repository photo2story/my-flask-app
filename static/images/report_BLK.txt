**1. Performance Analysis:**

BlackRock Inc. (BLK) is a global investment management corporation.  BLK has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return 24.94% higher than VOO's.  The provided relative divergence metric suggests this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical performance against VOO.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating Alpha and Beta values across different time periods.  While Alpha generally remains positive, indicating outperformance relative to the market (Beta represents market sensitivity; a Beta of 1 means the stock moves with the market), the magnitude varies considerably.  This suggests that BLK's performance is not consistently ahead of the market across all periods. High CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is observed in some periods, particularly 2019-2021, with a substantial 113%.  Conversely, periods of negative alpha and significant maximum drawdown (MDD) are also evident, highlighting the inherent volatility of the investment.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

While revenue has generally trended upwards, EPS shows some inconsistencies requiring further analysis to pinpoint underlying causes of fluctuations.  The repetition of the 2024-08-06 entry raises concerns about data accuracy.

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출       |

| 2024-08-06 | 10.07 | 4.80 B$    |

**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability show a generally upward trend, suggesting a healthy financial outlook.  Equity is also increasing, although ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, indicating the need for ongoing performance monitoring.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BLK has demonstrated strong performance relative to the S&P 500, particularly over the longer term.  However, the data also reveals periods of underperformance and volatility.  The current price is above its moving averages, and while RSI suggests it might be overbought, positive PPO and a recent upward trend in relative divergence offer a counterpoint.  Financial statements show a healthy growth in revenue and profitability.  A long-term investment strategy, considering the inherent volatility indicated by the varying Alpha and Beta values, and acknowledging the high RSI, could potentially yield positive returns exceeding the S&P 500, but further due diligence is recommended.  The accuracy of the earnings data needs to be verified.
