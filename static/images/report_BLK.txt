**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $916.26
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $885.16
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $890.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $942.95

The closing price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance at higher levels.  The price increase from the previous close ($892.54 to $916.26) represents a 2.66% jump, which could be interpreted as a minor, positive price jump.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 54.19 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.6254 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.8% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 2.0% (This is a long-term (2+ years) expected return exceeding the S&P 500 return.)

The conflicting signals from the short-term divergence and positive PPO suggest a period of consolidation or potential minor correction is possible.  The expected return of 2% above the S&P 500 is a positive projection for long-term investors.
