2025-01-12 - Analysis Report
## BlackRock Inc. (BLK) Investment Report

This report analyzes BlackRock Inc. (BLK), a leading global asset management firm, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

BlackRock Inc. (BLK) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The cumulative return for BLK is 117.64%, while the VOO's cumulative return is 112.20%. This represents a difference of **5.44%**.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, places BLK at the 38.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests consistent, albeit not always dramatically superior, performance compared to the broader market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last reported data point, BLK's closing price was $955.64.  The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day ($991.21), 20-day ($1028.94), and 60-day ($1019.55) moving averages, indicating a downward trend.  The fact that the closing price is significantly below these moving averages suggests a recent decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (29.69):**  The Relative Strength Index is below 30, suggesting the stock is in oversold territory. This could signal a potential bounce, but it's not a guarantee.
* **PPO (-0.92):** The Percentage Price Oscillator is negative, further supporting the bearish sentiment indicated by the RSI and moving averages.
* **Relative Divergence:**  The recent 20-day relative divergence of -16.5% indicates a short-term downward trend relative to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (5.4%):** This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  Given the current undervaluation relative to moving averages and the oversold RSI, this expectation may be achievable, but  market conditions can change.  The 5.4% is notable but not guaranteed.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue. While there's some quarter-to-quarter variation, there isn't a clear strong upward or downward trend evident from this limited data. Further analysis with longer-term data and industry comparisons would be necessary to draw robust conclusions.  The apparent duplicate entry for 2024-08-06 needs clarification.

| 2024-08-06 | 9.13  | $4.46B       | *(Duplicate entry needs clarification)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows relatively consistent revenue growth and profitability, although profit margins and ROE have seen some fluctuation.  The most recent quarter shows strong revenue and profit margin.  Consistent revenue growth is positive, suggesting a healthy business model. Further analysis is needed to assess the long-term sustainability of these metrics and compare them to industry benchmarks.

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin | Equity    | ROE     |
|-------------|----------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | $5.20B  | 51.13%        | $41.18B  | 3.96%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $4.80B  | 48.07%        | $40.10B  | 3.73%   |
| 2024-03-31  | $4.73B  | 46.40%        | $39.73B  | 3.96%   |
| 2023-12-31  | $4.63B  | 49.36%        | $39.35B  | 3.49%   |
| 2023-09-30  | $4.52B  | 47.26%        | $38.63B  | 4.15%   |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

BlackRock (BLK) presents a mixed picture. While it has historically outperformed the S&P 500 and shows consistent revenue growth and profitability, the recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  The oversold RSI could indicate a potential rebound, but this is not guaranteed.  The long-term expected return of 5.4% over the S&P 500 is attractive,  but investors should carefully consider the current market conditions and volatility before making investment decisions.  More comprehensive analysis, including comparisons to competitors and a deeper dive into financial statements, would provide a more complete picture.  The duplicate earnings data requires clarification.
