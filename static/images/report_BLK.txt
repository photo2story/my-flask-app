**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $829.99
* **Last Market Price:** $831.98
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $889.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $932.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $967.16

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price increase of $1.77 from the previous close might be a temporary bounce, given the overall trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 21.08 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -1.338 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -10.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -6.0%

The combination of high risk, oversold RSI, negative PPO, and downward trends suggests caution.  The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term is a significant concern. The recent price jump should be viewed with caution and possibly attributed to factors not captured in this analysis.

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's no clear upward or downward trend discernible from this limited data.  Further analysis with a longer time horizon and contextual factors (e.g., market conditions, company-specific news) is needed for conclusive insights.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BlackRock (BLK) currently shows a mixed performance. While the company demonstrates strong revenue and profitability, its recent stock performance has lagged behind the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a high-risk environment and a potential short-term downward trend.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  Further investigation into the underlying factors driving the recent underperformance and a more comprehensive analysis incorporating broader market conditions and news is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data needs clarification.
