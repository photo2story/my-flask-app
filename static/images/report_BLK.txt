## BlackRock Inc. (BLK) Investment Review

This report analyzes BlackRock Inc. (BLK), a global investment management corporation, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

BlackRock Inc. (BLK) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.  The cumulative return for BLK is 143.53%, while the VOO's cumulative return is 121.78%.  This represents a difference of 21.8 percentage points.  The relative divergence (60.0) indicates that BLK's outperformance is in the upper 60th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR data shows consistent outperformance, though varying significantly year to year.  The high CAGR of 113% from 2019-2021 is a notable outlier.  The maximum drawdown (MDD) varies, indicating periods of both significant risk and stability.  The consistently high Beta (around 0.4) suggests a moderate correlation with the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last market close, BLK's price was $1064.65.  The recent price trends show:

* **5-day moving average:** $1060.47
* **20-day moving average:** $1036.85
* **60-day moving average:** $999.92

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (69.76):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.13):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (+4.6):** Shows a recent positive trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-3.5%):**  This indicates a projected negative return over a long-term (2+ years) holding period relative to the S&P 500.  However, this should be considered in the context of  the significantly higher historical performance.  The current price ($1064.65) is not exceptionally high or low compared to the moving averages, so there's no immediate sign of a sharp price reversal.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals some inconsistencies: The date 2024-08-06 shows two different EPS and revenue figures.  Ignoring this duplication, the trend shows:

* **Revenue:** Shows slight quarter-to-quarter fluctuations but generally stable growth.
* **EPS:** Shows fluctuation, with a slight decline in Q2 2024 from Q1 2024 followed by a slight increase in Q3 2024. Without further context (like earnings expectations), it's impossible to assess whether these results beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is consistently increasing, showing stable, moderate growth. Profit margins are generally high and remain steady, fluctuating within a small range.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily increasing, though ROE shows some fluctuation, suggesting changes in profitability and/or capital allocation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**  No recent news or analyst opinions were provided for analysis.  Lack of this information limits the completeness of the investment assessment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BlackRock (BLK) has historically outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating consistent but fluctuating growth.  Recent price action suggests a positive short-term trend, although technical indicators suggest some caution.  Earnings show steady revenue growth with fluctuating but generally strong profitability.  The lack of recent news, analyst opinions, and comparison to earnings expectations limits the ability to make a complete assessment.  The long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500; however, the historical outperformance suggests that BLK may still be a worthwhile investment if the negative long-term projection is considered within the context of its prior significant outperformance. More data (particularly regarding earnings expectations and recent market news) is needed for a thorough investment recommendation.
