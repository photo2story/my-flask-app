**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

BlackRock Inc. (BLK) is a global investment management corporation.  Over the provided periods, BLK consistently outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), as evidenced by a 6.24% higher cumulative return.

Capitalization (Cap(B)) shows significant growth over the periods.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $885.16
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $890.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $942.95

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.

**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided, hindering a comprehensive financial analysis.  This crucial information is needed for a complete evaluation of BLK's financial health and performance.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BLK has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong alpha and consistent growth in market capitalization.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn. Technical indicators offer a mixed outlook, and the lack of comprehensive financial data limits a complete assessment.  The long-term outlook, based on the provided expected return, remains positive, but further investigation is necessary to confirm this assessment.  A more complete dataset, particularly concerning financial statements and a corrected earnings report, would significantly improve the reliability of this analysis.
