## BlackRock Inc. (BLK) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

BlackRock Inc. (BLK), a global investment management corporation, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.  The cumulative return for BLK is 132.35%, while VOO's is 122.16%. This represents a difference of 10.2 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 45.0% indicates that BLK's outperformance relative to its historical range against the S&P 500 is in the upper quartile.  While impressive, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows highly variable performance across different three-year periods, ranging from 9% to 113%. This underscores the inherent volatility within the investment management sector and the importance of long-term perspective when analyzing performance.  The alpha consistently around 0.4 suggests consistent outperformance relative to the market, but the beta of approximately 0.4 indicates lower sensitivity to overall market movements than the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last recorded data point, BLK closed at $1020.45.  The price has seen a slight increase compared to the previous close. Key moving averages suggest a relatively stable price:

* **5-day MA:** $1012.31
* **20-day MA:** $1008.40
* **60-day MA:** $1020.43

The price is currently slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages and almost identical to the 60-day moving average, suggesting a relatively stable short-to-medium-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 50.79 – This indicates that the stock is trading near neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.35 – A positive PPO suggests upward momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:**  The recent 20-day relative divergence of -0.2 suggests a slight downward trend. This is minor and, in combination with the other indicators, does not necessarily signal a bearish trend.
* **Expected Return:** A 3.8% expected return, relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon (2+ years), implies potential outperformance but should be interpreted cautiously, as this is a projection, not a guarantee.  The relatively small price change (0.27%) from the previous close doesn't indicate a significant event (like a sudden surge or drop).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some variability in both EPS and revenue. While revenue remains relatively stable around $4.5B to $4.8B, EPS fluctuates more significantly.  There's a need for further analysis to determine the underlying reasons for this EPS variability.  Further investigation is needed into the apparent duplicated data point for 2024-08-06.

**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profit margins show a generally upward trend, with a slight dip in Q1 2024.  This suggests healthy and stable growth in the company's core business. Equity is steadily increasing, indicating strong financial health.  Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates but remains generally positive, suggesting effective use of shareholder capital.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BlackRock (BLK) demonstrates a strong long-term performance record relative to the S&P 500, supported by generally positive technical indicators and healthy financial metrics.  However, volatility is evident in both short-term price movements and earnings.  The current valuation relative to the market and industry peers warrants further analysis.  The relatively low beta suggests lower overall market risk.  Further due diligence, considering factors like valuation multiples (P/E ratio, etc.), competitive landscape and future growth prospects, is necessary before making any investment decisions. The data provided highlights a potentially attractive long-term investment, but caution is advised due to the inherent volatility in the financial services sector.
