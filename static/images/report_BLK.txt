## BlackRock Inc. (BLK) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

BlackRock Inc. (BLK) is a global investment management corporation.  The provided data shows a cumulative return slightly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the significance of this underperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

BLK's cumulative return of 65.38% lags behind the S&P 500's 66.36% return by -1.0 percentage points. This represents a relatively small difference considering the historical volatility range (-22.9% to 35.5%). The relative divergence of -37.5% indicates the current underperformance is near the lower end of the historical range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals varying performance relative to the market (Beta) and excess returns (Alpha) over different periods.  While Alpha is generally positive, suggesting outperformance, it's highly variable, indicating inconsistent risk-adjusted returns.  The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap) over time is noteworthy.  The high Beta values generally suggest higher sensitivity to market movements.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 53.0% | 51.5% | 2.30% | 0.2 | 66.2 |
| 2016-2018  | 7.0% | 59.1% | -10.0% | 0.4 | 51.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 19.0% | 59.1% | -10.0% | 1.4 | 68.4 |
| 2018-2020  | -3.0% | 59.1% | -28.0% | 2.1 | 100.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 76.0% | 60.0% | 21.0% | 2.5 | 130.3 |
| 2020-2022  | 17.0% | 66.6% | 11.0% | 2.3 | 103.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 32.0% | 66.6% | 16.0% | 1.3 | 122.2 |
| 2022-2024  | 28.0% | 68.4% | 11.0% | 1.3 | 158.1 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $878.78
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $853.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $921.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $960.03

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term. The recent price increase from the previous close ($858.78 to $878.78) indicates a modest positive change, but it's not a significant jump.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)  Indicates heightened market volatility.
* **RSI:** 37.65 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.68 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +4.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -5.2% (Negative expected return relative to the benchmark, at least in the short term).  This needs clarification: is this -5.2% compared to the S&P 500 over the next 2 years?

The conflicting signals from the technical indicators warrant careful consideration. While RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and negative expected return indicate a bearish outlook.  The recent small price increase is a short-term movement that shouldn't override the overall negative sentiment.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-08-06 | 10.07 | $4.80 B      |

| 2024-08-06 | 9.13  | $4.46 B      | *(Duplicate entry?)*


Earnings show some fluctuations.  There's a possible data entry error with duplicate entries for August 2024.  Revenue has been relatively stable, while EPS shows some minor decrease in recent quarters. More detailed analysis, including YoY and QoQ comparisons and considering industry trends is required.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BLK shows mixed signals. While it demonstrates strong financial performance with increasing revenue and generally high profit margins, recent price action suggests a bearish trend in the short-to-medium term. The relatively low RSI and negative PPO reinforce this, although the recent price increase warrants attention.  The slightly lower return compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period is not significantly alarming in the context of historical volatility, especially given the potential for Alpha generation reflected in the historical data.  However, further investigation into the accuracy of the provided data (particularly the duplicate entry in earnings data) and a deeper dive into the individual components of the financial statements and industry trends are crucial before forming a definitive conclusion.  The long-term outlook needs more detailed analysis before a conclusion regarding its prospects for outperforming the S&P 500 can be drawn.  Consideration should also be given to the high beta, which means this is a high-risk investment that will experience larger swings than the market as a whole.
