**1. Return Rate Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** BlackRock Inc. is a multinational investment management corporation.

*   **Returns:**
    *   BLK Cumulative Return: 54.54%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 100.88%

*   RSI: 54.20
*   PPO: 0.22
*   Hybrid Signal: Cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash
*   Recent 20-day Relative Divergence Change: 2.8 (+): Short-term increase

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:**  A reading of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk based on the model.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 54.2 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.22 suggests a very minor bullish momentum.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests a strong buy with 90% of available cash. This is a bullish signal.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** A positive change in relative divergence over the last 20 days indicates a recent short-term upward trend in BLK's performance relative to VOO.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-124.9%) is a concerning indicator.  It suggests a very pessimistic outlook for BLK's future performance compared to the S&P 500.  *This number seems unusually low and could be an outlier or the result of a specific calculation method that heavily penalizes certain factors.* It's important to investigate the methodology used to calculate this value.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive/Neutral:**
    *   "BlackRock stock split: what’s next for BLK shares?" A stock split is generally considered neutral to slightly positive as it can increase liquidity and make the stock more accessible to retail investors.
    *   "How AI deals and infrastructure mega-funds reshaped private investing" BlackRock is likely involved in these trends, suggesting potential growth areas.

*   **Negative:**
    *   "Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft Has Lowered Expectations for BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Stock Price" This indicates that at least one analyst is becoming more bearish on the stock.
    *   "Black Creek Dumps 999,000 Shares of Baidu Stock Worth $49.1 Million" While not directly about BlackRock, this suggests a potential shift in investment strategy, which could indirectly impact BlackRock's holdings or perceived expertise.
    *   "IVZ or BLK: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?" This comparison suggests that BLK may not be seen as the best value in its sector.

*   **General:**
    *    "BlackRock Stock (BLK) Preview: What to Know Before the U.S. Market Opens on Dec. 15, 2025" General market overview.

*   **Analysis:**  The news is mixed. The lowered expectations from Deutsche Bank and the Baidu stock dump are negative signals.  The stock split is potentially positive, and BlackRock's involvement in AI and infrastructure mega-funds could present future opportunities.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   Consensus: Buy
*   Mean: 1.71 (~Buy)
*   Opinions: 15
*   Target Price (avg/high/low): 1319.33 / 1514.00 / 1170.00
*   Recent Rating Changes: No recent changes are listed

*   **Analysis:**  The analyst consensus is overwhelmingly positive, with a "Buy" rating and a mean rating leaning towards a Strong Buy.  The average target price suggests significant upside potential from the current price (1060.17). The lack of recent rating changes suggests that analysts haven't drastically altered their views recently.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출    |
|------------|--------|---------|
| 2024-08-06 | 10.07  | 4.80 B$ |
| 2024-05-07 | 10.58  | 4.73 B$ |
| 2023-11-06 | 10.75  | 4.52 B$ |
| 2023-08-04 | 9.13   | 4.46 B$ |
| 2024-08-06 | 9.13  | 4.46 B$ |

*   **Analysis:** Earnings per share (EPS) shows volatility, with some fluctuations. Revenue has generally been trending upwards, but not in a consistent manner. The latest reported EPS is 9.13, lower compared to the previous. Investors may have reacted negatively to the decline in EPS. The repeated EPS and Revenue amounts in the final two lines are likely a typo.

**6. Financial Information**

|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $6.51B | 45.94% |
| 2025-06-30 | $5.42B | 47.87% |

| 2024-12-31 | $5.68B | 49.25% |
| 2024-09-30 | $5.20B | 51.13% |

| 2024-12-31 | $47.49B | 3.52% |
| 2024-09-30 | $41.18B | 3.96% |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has generally increased over the recent quarters, with a notable jump in the latest quarter. Profit margin, however, has declined from 51.13% to 45.94%. Equity has been growing steadily. Return on Equity (ROE) has declined from 3.96% to 2.38% over the last five quarters, likely due to the increase in Equity and the decline in Profit Margin.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** BLK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Risk:**  High maximum drawdown values suggest a risky investment, and Beta values demonstrate high volatility compared to the overall market.
*   **Technicals:**  Mixed signals. Short-term trends are slightly positive, but longer-term trends are less clear.  The MRI suggests medium risk. RSI is neutral.
*   **News:** Mixed. Analyst downgrade and divestment news is concerning. The potential stock split is positive.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:**  Strongly bullish, with significant upside potential indicated by target prices.
*   **Earnings:** Mixed. Revenue is trending up, but EPS and Profit Margin have fluctuated and declined more recently.
*   **Financials:** Revenue growing, Equity growing, Profit Margin falling, ROE falling.
*   **Major Caveat:** The very negative Expected Return (-124.9%) is a major red flag and requires further investigation into the calculation methodology.

*   **Overall Recommendation:** The data presents a mixed picture. While analysts are bullish and the company is growing, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, declining Profit Margin and ROE, and especially the highly negative Expected Return are major concerns. The analyst's overwhelmingly positive outlook needs to be balanced with potential downside risk. Investors should conduct further due diligence and understand the reasons for the divergence in performance and the extremely low expected return before making any investment decisions.
