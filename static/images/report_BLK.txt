BlackRock Inc. (BLK) is a leading global asset management corporation.  Over the period analyzed, BLK has outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by 1.34%, showing a relative outperformance at the 33.3rd percentile of its historical range against VOO.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis indicates varying levels of outperformance (Alpha) and market sensitivity (Beta) across different timeframes.  While Alpha generally indicates positive outperformance relative to the market, the fluctuations suggest BLK's performance isn't consistently superior to the market, and Beta values show considerable market correlation. The considerable size of the company (Cap(B)) has fluctuated significantly through the years, implying change in company valuation.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

BLK's price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. The recent price change (-$0.93) shows a minor decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (24.61):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is due, but it's not a guarantee.
* **PPO (-0.44):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (-1.2):** Shows a recent weakening in relative strength, reinforcing the bearish signal.
* **Expected Return (4.3%):**  Suggests a potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This should be viewed cautiously as it's a forecast, not a guaranteed outcome.  The recent price drop of -$0.93 doesn't constitute a dramatic event requiring special consideration.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While revenue generally shows an increasing trend, EPS shows more fluctuation.  More data would be needed to identify clear trends.  Note the duplicate entry for 2024-08-06.

|------------|-------|-------------|

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has been steadily increasing, with profit margins consistently strong, averaging above 49%. ROE is relatively stable, though lower in recent quarters. The increase in equity suggests strong financial health.


| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $5.68B   | 49.25%        |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BLK shows a mixed picture. While long-term performance has generally outperformed the S&P 500, recent trends suggest a short-term bearish outlook. The company's financials are strong, and the projected long-term outperformance is positive, but the current oversold conditions and negative momentum indicators warrant caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price decline and earnings fluctuation would be beneficial before making any investment decisions.  The forecast of a 4.3% long-term outperformance should be considered with a healthy dose of skepticism.  It's vital to incorporate your own risk tolerance and investment strategy into the decision-making process.
