This report analyzes BlackRock Inc. (BLK), a global investment management corporation, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

BlackRock Inc. (BLK) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.  The cumulative return for BLK is 133.41%, while the VOO's cumulative return is 114.36%. This represents a difference of **19.05%**.  The provided relative divergence of 56.5% indicates that this outperformance is in the upper range of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $1020.30
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $1049.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $1036.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $1003.25

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term.  The 5-day moving average being significantly higher than the current price signals a recent price drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.27 – This indicates a relatively neutral market sentiment, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO:** -0.23 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.3% – Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.7% – This suggests that, while BLK has historically outperformed, the model projects a slightly negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500.  This should be viewed cautiously as it may depend on the inputs and assumptions of the model.

The current price of $1020.30, being below the recent moving averages, does not indicate a sharp rebound or drop; instead it aligns with a moderate downward trend.
