## BlackRock Inc. (BLK) Stock Review

This report analyzes BlackRock Inc. (BLK), a global investment management corporation, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

BlackRock's cumulative return (117.49%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (112.47%) by 5.02%.  The relative outperformance (38.1% on a scale of the historical minimum and maximum difference) indicates that this level of outperformance is relatively high compared to historical data.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $955.01
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $978.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $1023.428
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $1018.7666

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The significant gap between the current price and the moving averages indicates a recent price decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 30.33 – This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.00 – This negative value points towards a bearish trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -14.6% – A recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 5.5% above the S&P 500.  This implies potential outperformance relative to the market over the long term.  The current price of $955.01, being below the moving averages, does not immediately suggest a rapid rebound; rather, it shows a downtrend continuing, though an oversold RSI suggests potential for a reversal.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BlackRock (BLK) shows strong long-term performance, consistently outperforming the S&P 500. However, the recent price action indicates a short-term downturn. While technical indicators suggest the stock might be oversold, the negative PPO and downward price trend warrant caution.  The financial statements reflect a healthy and growing company, with high profit margins.  The projected long-term outperformance against the S&P 500 is a positive sign. A more in-depth analysis is required to clarify the duplicate data point in the earnings report and interpret the short-term trend.  Investors should weigh the potential for a rebound against the current negative momentum before making investment decisions.
