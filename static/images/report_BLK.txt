**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news is provided.  Information regarding market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights is missing. This information is crucial for a comprehensive analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BLK has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing consistent positive alpha.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downtrend, supported by a negative PPO and recent relative divergence. While financial statements demonstrate solid revenue and profitability, the inconsistent revenue and EPS growth, along with a negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 (-3.8%) raise concerns.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions hinders a complete assessment.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative expected return and the absence of consistent growth in revenue and EPS is needed.  The relatively high current valuation compared to moving averages might make a strong buy decision premature. More information, particularly on recent news and analyst sentiment, is necessary before forming a definitive investment opinion.
