The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The last market price of 1072.77 indicates a recent price jump.  This could be interpreted as a recent, sharp price increase (a possible "spike" that might require further investigation to determine if it's indicative of sustained growth or a short-term fluctuation), as it is significantly higher than the current closing price.

* **PPO:** 0.0581 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.5% (This suggests that the current valuation may not offer significant outperformance in relation to the S&P500 over the long term.  Further investigation is needed to understand why it is negative)
