* **5-Day Moving Average:** $968.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $1018.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $1017.97

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 28.4 - This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.94 - This negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -8.4% -  A negative change in relative divergence indicates a recent weakening in the stock's performance relative to the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 5.0% - This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500, assuming a continued investment strategy. The current price of $963.17, being below moving averages, suggests this 5% expected return may still be optimistic, and its achievement depends on market conditions and BLK's future performance. No significant price jump (neither upward nor downward) is indicated by this data.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**
