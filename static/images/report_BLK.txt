This suggests BLK has generally outperformed the market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha values (ranging from -5.3% to 53.3%), indicating that BLK has historically generated returns exceeding what would be expected based solely on its beta (market risk exposure).  The beta values hover around 1.2-1.4, suggesting that BLK's price is somewhat more volatile than the overall market.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates, reflecting market conditions, but consistently remains positive. MDD (Maximum Drawdown) shows periods of significant decline, highlighting the inherent risk in investing in BLK.  Market cap has also grown over the years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 1047.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 1043.12
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 1009.48
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 954.17

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. The relatively small gap between the closing price and the 5-day MA indicates recent stability.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 75.57 -  This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term correction might be due.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.16 - A positive value suggests upward momentum, though a relatively low value indicates this momentum is not extremely strong.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 11.38 (+), indicating recent upward momentum in the short term.
* **Expected Return:** -0.01% - This suggests a negligible expected return at the current price.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is positive, given the historical outperformance indicated by the cumulative return analysis.  Given that -0.01% is extremely low and given the overall positive trend from previous points and provided data it may not fully reflect the market sentiment or possible upward trend of BLK.

The last traded price (1046.78) is very close to the closing price, suggesting no significant immediate price movements (no sudden jumps or drops).
