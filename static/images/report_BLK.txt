    *   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, showing inconsistent growth.
    *   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown indicates substantial risk of loss.
    *   **Alpha:** Negative Alpha in many periods suggests underperformance relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark. The latest data point of -44.0% is very concerning.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuate over time.  Higher Beta (e.g., 2.2, 3.0, 3.1) means the stock is more volatile than the market and tend to amplify market movements.
    *   **Cap:** Market capitalization has generally increased, reflecting BlackRock's overall growth as a company.

*   **Financials:** Revenue is generally increasing, but profitability and ROE are decreasing.
*   **Expected Return:**  The extremely negative expected return of -218.4% is a major red flag.

*   **MRI:** Market Risk Indicator suggests high investment recommended. It should be noted that MRI is just one indicator and should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the data provided, a **Sell/Avoid** recommendation is warranted. The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, combined with the high risk profile, negative Alpha, decreasing profitability, concerning downgrade, and, most importantly, the extremely negative expected return, make BlackRock a risky investment at this time. While the analyst consensus is positive, the recent downgrade and the negative performance indicators outweigh this sentiment. The MRI indicates high investment is recommended, so it is important to consider all available information and decide whether to invest or not.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data Accuracy:** The duplicated earnings entry and the lack of recent rating changes raise concerns about the accuracy and currency of the data. This should be verified.
*   **Time Horizon:** This analysis is based on the provided time frame. Longer-term trends may paint a different picture.
*   **Individual Risk Tolerance:** This is a general assessment. Investment decisions should always be aligned with individual risk tolerance and investment goals.
