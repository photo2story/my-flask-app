*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, ranging from negative to very strong positive growth. The most recent 2023-2025 period shows a decent 22%.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD values across all periods, suggesting significant risk and volatility.  Values consistently above 60% and often above 75% are substantial.
    *   **Alpha:**  Periods of both outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha) relative to the market. The latest period (2023-2025) shows a very large negative alpha of -43%, indicating significant underperformance.
    *   **Beta:**  Generally low Beta values (close to 0 or negative) indicate that BLK's price is less sensitive to market movements, until recently, where Beta became much higher. The recent Beta jumps to over 1, signifying higher correlation with the S&P 500.
    *   **Cap(B) (Assets Under Management in Billions):** Shows generally consistent growth in AUM over the years, despite performance fluctuations.

**2) Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 1079.87
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 1072.16, Previous Close: 1070.37, Change: 0.17
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 1052.02
    *   20-day SMA: 1049.47
    *   60-day SMA: 1108.64

*   **Analysis:** The current price is above both the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which *could* suggest a short-term upward trend.  However, it's still significantly below the 60-day SMA, which *could* indicate that the longer-term trend is still down or sideways.  The small change in the last market price suggests recent price stability.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 46.58
*   **PPO:** 0.67
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -920.2

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI:**  A reading of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, indicating a moderate level of risk associated with the stock.
    *   **RSI:**  An RSI of 46.58 is neutral. It's neither overbought (above 70) nor oversold (below 30).
    *   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is slightly above the longer-term moving average, which can signal a potential upward trend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** "Buy 100% of cash" suggests a positive outlook and a buy recommendation, indicating confidence in future price appreciation despite recent fluctuation.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The "short-term decline" suggests some recent weakness in the stock price relative to the comparison.
    *   **Expected Return:**  The exceptionally low expected return (-920.2%) is very concerning and suggests a highly unfavorable outlook based on the model used to calculate it.  This should be investigated further as it is likely an anomaly.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

| 2024-05-07 | 10.58 | 4.73 B$     |

*   **Analysis:** EPS figures show some fluctuation but a general trend upwards, with a drop down to 9.13 and then a rise again. Revenue also shows a similar trend. However, the same earnings are listed twice, so this table is incomplete. We can still see that the company has a history of profitability and stable financials, which could be promising for long term returns.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

BlackRock (BLK) presents a mixed picture based on the provided data.

*   **Underperformance:** BLK has significantly underperformed the S\&P 500 in the period covered by the cumulative return data, and the negative Alpha figures further emphasize this underperformance. The Beta of 1.3 on the most recent period shows some correlation with the market, but it might be too little too late.
*   **Volatility:** High Maximum Drawdown values indicate significant risk and volatility.
*   **Recent Price Action:** The current price is above short-term moving averages, but still below the 60-day SMA, and the recent divergence change indicates short-term weakness.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** The positive analyst consensus, rating upgrade, and "Buy" hybrid signal contrast sharply with the negative expected return and recent underperformance.
*   **Strong Financials:** Revenue, Equity, and Profit Margin levels are all strong.
*   **News Impact:** Recent news highlights valuation concerns and share price swings.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts are overwhelmingly positive on BLK, with significant upside potential predicted.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data presents a conflicted investment picture. The past performance and expected return are worrying, but analyst sentiment is strong, and the company has very strong financials. It's crucial to investigate the discrepancy between the highly negative expected return and other indicators. It is recommended to review why the model produced such a negative value, as it may be an outlier.
