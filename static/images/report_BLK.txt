## BlackRock Inc. (BLK) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

* **Ticker:** BLK
* **Company:** BlackRock Inc. (World's largest asset manager)
* **Cumulative Return (BLK):** 81.65%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 91.19%
* **Return Difference (BLK vs VOO):** -9.5%
* **Relative Divergence:** 32.4% (indicates BLK's performance is in the 32.4th percentile relative to its historical performance against VOO)

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

BlackRock (BLK) underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a cumulative return 9.5 percentage points lower than VOO.  The relative divergence indicates that this underperformance is relatively moderate compared to its historical range of divergence.

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others demonstrate negative alpha (underperformance).  The beta fluctuates, suggesting varying sensitivity to market movements.  Notably, the market capitalization (Cap) consistently increased over the years.  Further analysis of market conditions during these periods would be needed for a complete understanding.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $967.94
* **Last Market Price:** $930.24 (a decrease of $16.46 or -1.74% from the previous close of $946.70)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $964.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $948.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $978.70

The recent price shows a short-term decline, as indicated by the price being below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, but above the 20-day moving average. This suggests a potential short-term correction after a period of higher prices.  The substantial drop from the previous close should be further investigated for news or events that might have caused the price drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.57 (slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.6294 (positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -19.7% (This is a concerning figure, suggesting potential significant underperformance against the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon. More detail on the calculation methodology is needed to properly interpret this result.)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO and the relative divergence change point towards a bullish short-term outlook, the MRI indicates medium risk, and the negative expected return casts doubt on the long-term prospects.  The large negative change in the last market price needs to be contextualized, as it significantly impacts the overall assessment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-08-06 | $10.07 | $4.80 B     |
| 2024-05-07 | $10.58 | $4.73 B     |
| 2023-11-06 | $10.75 | $4.52 B     |

| 2024-08-06 | $9.13  | $4.46 B     | *(Duplicate Entry)*

There's a discrepancy in the data; the August 6th, 2024 entry is duplicated.  EPS shows some fluctuation, but revenue generally shows a slight upward trend.  A more complete and consistent dataset is needed for a thorough analysis.  Further investigation is recommended to resolve the data inconsistencies.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BlackRock's performance has been mixed. While the company shows revenue growth and generally healthy profitability, its stock price has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, raising concerns.  The negative long-term expected return is particularly concerning and requires further investigation.  The recent price drop warrants a closer examination of market news and events.  The inconsistent alpha and beta values across different periods indicate volatility in performance relative to market trends.  Data inconsistencies in earnings data need to be addressed before drawing conclusive insights.  Further research into the reasons behind the negative expected return and the recent price drop is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The available data does not provide a clear buy/sell recommendation.
