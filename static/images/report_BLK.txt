## BlackRock Inc. (BLK) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

BlackRock Inc. (BLK), a global investment management corporation, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The cumulative return for BLK is 143.67%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 122.07%. This represents a difference of 21.6 percentage points.  The provided relative divergence of 59.8% indicates that BLK's performance is positioned in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent positive alpha (0.4) across multiple years, suggesting BLK consistently outperformed the market benchmark.  The beta (approximately 0.4) indicates lower volatility than the market, with market capitalization steadily growing over the years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $1065.26
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $1051.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $1033.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $993.13

The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The Last-market price of $1052.15 reflects a recent slight dip, but remains positive overall.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.62  (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.15 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +10.7% (Short-term upward trend)

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, indicating potential for a short-term correction. However, the positive PPO and strong recent relative strength suggest continued upward momentum. The expected return of -3.5% is counterintuitive given other positive indicators, and may require further investigation.  It's critical to understand the assumptions behind this -3.5% figure. The statement that the -3.5% figure represents the expected return over a long-term period (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is contradictory with all other positive indicators and would need deeper examination of the methodology used to achieve this figure.
