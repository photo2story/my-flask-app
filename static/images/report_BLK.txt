* **60-Day Moving Average:** $975.10

The price is slightly above its 20-day moving average but below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent price increase but potentially indicating a short-term overbought condition, although still in a positive trend.  The last market price reflects a minor, positive 1-day move.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.0% (Short-term weakening trend)
* **Expected Return:** -24.7% (Negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term).  This suggests underperformance is expected in the future.

The recent price increase (Last Market) does not appear to be a significant jump (not a "rapid surge"). The indicators suggest a moderately positive short-term outlook, although a negative long-term expected return casts doubt on significant future outperformance.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

BlackRock (BLK) demonstrates strong financial health, with consistent revenue growth and high profit margins.  However, its recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500. While technical indicators show a moderately positive short-term outlook, the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises concerns about its future outperformance. Further investigation into the reasons for underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and clarification on the duplicate earnings data, are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The relatively high Beta suggests significant market sensitivity, adding to the risk profile.
