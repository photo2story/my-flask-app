* **EPS:** Fluctuates quarter-to-quarter, with a slight downward trend in the most recent quarter.  The significant drop in EPS from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024 (10.58 to 10.07) is notable.  There's also a duplicate entry for August 6th, 2024, with inconsistent EPS figures, requiring clarification.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions, which is not provided in the initial prompt.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BlackRock (BLK) has historically outperformed the S&P 500,  but the current data reveals some concerns. The negative expected return (-4.3%) suggests potential underperformance compared to the market benchmark in the long term. While revenue remains robust, recent EPS figures show some weakening, and technical indicators are currently neutral to slightly bearish. The mixed recent earnings performance warrants further investigation to determine if it's cyclical or indicative of underlying business challenges. Further analysis including missing news and analyst opinions is needed for a more comprehensive evaluation.  The high historical performance does not guarantee future success.

**8. Recommendations:**

A more thorough analysis, including information on recent news, analyst ratings, and a comparison to earnings expectations, is needed before formulating a definitive investment recommendation. However, based solely on the provided data, a cautious approach is advised.  The divergence from the S&P 500, while historically positive, is currently not exhibiting strong bullish signals.  Further research into the reasons behind the recent EPS decrease and the negative expected return is crucial before making an investment decision.
