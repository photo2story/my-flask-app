However, the beta (around 0.4) suggests lower volatility than the market. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has grown steadily over the years.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** 999.92

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent upward momentum.  It's also above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a bullish trend. The difference between the closing and last market price suggests a recent minor price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** 0.13 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)

The relatively high RSI suggests caution;  the stock might be overbought.  However, the positive PPO and relative strength change support the recent upward momentum.  The provided expected return is relative to the S&P 500 and suggests underperformance over a long timeframe, a point to carefully consider.

BLK has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but the extent of outperformance varies across different time periods. Recent price action suggests a bullish trend, supported by moving average analysis and positive momentum indicators (PPO). However, a relatively high RSI suggests the stock may be approaching overbought territory.  Earnings data shows a generally improving revenue picture, but with some EPS fluctuation.  Financial data indicates improved profitability and efficiency.  A long-term outlook requires careful consideration of the lower projected return compared to the S&P 500, despite the historical outperformance. The lack of information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions limits a more comprehensive assessment.  Further investigation is recommended before making any investment decisions.
