**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price shows a slight upward trend. The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term bullish momentum. However, it is still below the 60-day moving average indicating a longer-term trend which may require further monitoring.  The recent price change of +1.84 reflects a positive day.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 58.84 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.  A positive PPO of 0.21 supports the bullish short-term trend indicated by moving averages. The recent relative divergence change of +4.4 further emphasizes the short-term upward momentum. The MRI of 0.42 suggests a medium level of market risk.  The expected return of -3.6% over the long term (2+ years) implies a potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500, though this should be considered in the context of its current outperformance and other factors.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some variability in both EPS and revenue.  There's no clear upward or downward trend readily apparent from this limited dataset.  Further analysis, including consideration of seasonality and macroeconomic factors, would be necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.
