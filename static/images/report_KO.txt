This suggests a potential short-term upward trend, but the price is still below the 60-day average, indicating possible resistance.

*   **Price change:** The 0.83% change from the previous close reflects a small price increase, which doesn't necessarily indicate a major market event on its own.

**Analysis:** Despite the high MRI suggesting investment suitability, the significant negative expected return warrants caution. It implies that while the stock is considered relatively safe, it is expected to underperform the S&P 500 significantly over the long term. The short-term decrease in relative divergence further supports the trend of recent underperformance.
