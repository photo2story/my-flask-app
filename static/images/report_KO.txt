Okay, here's the requested report and analysis of Coca-Cola (KO), incorporating all the provided data points.

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Coca-Cola Co (KO) is a global beverage company, primarily known for its carbonated soft drinks.

*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.58%

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates considerably, ranging from 0% to 28%. The most recent period (2023-2025) shows an 18% CAGR.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD across the later periods (around 80%), indicating significant price volatility and potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** Generally negative, especially in recent periods (e.g., -47% for 2023-2025), meaning the stock has underperformed its benchmark (risk-adjusted). Positive Alpha only appeared in 2017-2019 and 2020-2022.
*   **Beta:** Generally low (between 0 and 0.7), indicating that KO's price is not as sensitive to market movements as the overall market.
*   **Cap(B) Market Cap:** Shows consistent growth in market cap over the periods.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 70.81
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 70.05, Previous Close: 70.45, Change: -0.57
*   **5-day SMA:** 71.70
*   **20-day SMA:** 71.24
*   **60-day SMA:** 68.73

**Analysis:** The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, the price is above the 60-day SMA, indicating that the longer-term trend may still be positive, although momentum is waning. The last market data shows a slight decrease in price.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 45.55 (Neutral.  Above 30 is considered oversold, below 70 is considered overbought.)
*   **PPO:** -0.27 (Slightly negative, suggesting bearish momentum, but not strongly so.)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (14 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-07)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -6.8 (Indicates short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -92.0 (Highly negative)

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates a medium investment risk.  The RSI is neutral. The negative PPO suggests slight bearish momentum. The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, possibly due to the perceived "Very Safe" nature of the stock and a high MRI. The negative change in relative divergence supports the recent decline. The significantly negative Expected Return suggests that, based on the model used, long-term investment from this point is *not* expected to be profitable and is expected to severely underperform the S&P 500.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** KO has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, as indicated by the negative divergence.
*   **Volatility:** High Maximum Drawdown suggests significant price fluctuations.
*   **Negative Alpha:**  KO has consistently underperformed its risk-adjusted benchmark.
*   **Short-Term Downtrend:** Recent price action (below 5-day and 20-day SMAs) suggests a short-term downtrend.
*   **Medium Risk:** The MRI indicates medium investment risk.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The model predicts a highly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Mixed News:** News headlines are mixed, with some highlighting positives (dividends, cash recovery) and others questioning performance.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts have a "Buy" consensus and a higher target price.
*   **Strong Financials:** Revenue, profit margins, equity, and ROE show positive trends.

**Conclusion:**

The data paints a complex picture of Coca-Cola. While the company exhibits strong financial health (high profit margins, increasing revenue and equity), the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and exhibits negative alpha. Recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend.  The *model's* negative expected return is a serious concern.

However, analysts are generally optimistic, suggesting potential undervaluation. The high dividend yield, mentioned in some news articles, may attract income-seeking investors.

**In summary, based on the provided information, an investor would need to carefully weigh the strong fundamentals and analyst optimism against the stock's underperformance, negative alpha, potential short-term downtrend, and the significantly negative expected return predicted by the model. The negative expected return and strong historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500 should be a primary concern.** The "Buy" hybrid signal should be viewed with caution given the other negative indicators.
