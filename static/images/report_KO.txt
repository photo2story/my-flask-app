* **Closing Price:** $62.59
* **5-day Moving Average:** $62.35
* **20-day Moving Average:** $64.54
* **60-day Moving Average:** $68.76

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (23.44):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible. However,  a low RSI alone is not a reliable buy signal.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-9.99):**  Confirms a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** This indicates that no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated in the long term (2+ years), given the current conditions and historical data.  This doesn't mean no growth, just no expected excess growth compared to the benchmark.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows some fluctuation.  While revenue remains relatively consistent around $11-12B, EPS shows more variation.  Missing information (like analyst estimates for the most recent quarter) prevents a definitive analysis of performance against expectations.  Further information is needed for a complete picture.

**5. Financial Statements Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Consistent high revenue with strong profit margins (generally above 60%) shows strong revenue generation.  However, slight margin compression is observed in recent quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  ROE shows some volatility, but overall remains positive, indicating reasonable profitability relative to equity.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* *This section requires information from recent news sources (like Shacknews, FINBOLD) within the last two days to provide an accurate assessment of recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.  Without this information, a complete analysis is not possible.*

**7. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows consistent growth over the analyzed periods but with varying levels of volatility (MDD - Maximum Drawdown and Alpha/Beta).  The Beta consistently hovers around 0.5-0.7, indicating moderate sensitivity to market movements.  Alpha being generally negative implies underperformance relative to the market benchmark (though it also varies over the analyzed periods.)

**8. Overall Summary:**

KO's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly.  While the stock is currently in oversold territory (RSI),  other indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend.  Long-term growth isn't definitively ruled out, but the expected return is currently low relative to the market benchmark.  The financial statements show generally strong profitability and revenue generation but some fluctuation. More information is needed to fully interpret this fluctuation and the recent performance in comparison to analyst expectations.  News and analyst opinions are crucial for a complete picture of the current investment climate surrounding KO.


**9. Recommendations:**

Further research into recent news, analyst ratings, and a comparison of the reported financial results with analyst expectations are crucial before making any investment decisions. While the low RSI suggests potential upside, the overall bearish trend and significant underperformance relative to the market raise concerns.  A thorough risk assessment is necessary.  Consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate the risk associated with underperforming stocks.
