The data shows fluctuating CAGR and Alpha, indicating varying performance relative to the market.  Beta generally hovers around 0.4, suggesting lower volatility than the overall market.  The negative Alphas in several periods indicate underperformance against the benchmark.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $71.43
* 5-Day Moving Average: $69.79
* 20-Day Moving Average: $70.15
* 60-Day Moving Average: $67.83

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the difference isn't substantial.  The recent price increase of $0.95 (from $70.76) is a relatively small positive change, not indicative of a significant jump.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.47 (High Risk category)
* RSI: 58.73 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* PPO: -0.13 (Slightly bearish)
* Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day): -21.0% (Short-term downward trend)
* Expected Return (2+ years): -9.3% (Expected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term).

The combination of a high MRI, slightly negative PPO, and negative relative strength change suggests caution.  The negative expected return further supports this cautious outlook.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Revenue shows some fluctuation, but there's no clear trend. EPS is inconsistent, with some quarters showing higher and some lower earnings.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Coca-Cola's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been mixed, with recent underperformance. While the company demonstrates strong profit margins and relatively stable revenue, several indicators (high MRI, negative PPO and expected return) suggest a cautious outlook. The fluctuating EPS and inconsistent financial metrics over the past year warrant further investigation.  Long-term investors should carefully consider the relatively low expected return compared to the S&P 500 before committing significant capital.  Further analysis of the duplicate earnings data entry is needed.
