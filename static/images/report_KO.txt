**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

Coca-Cola (KO) presents a mixed picture. While the company exhibits strong profitability, consistent revenue, and increasing equity, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook. Analyst opinions are generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and a target price above the current price. However, the extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Investigate the reason for the extremely negative expected return.** This figure is a major outlier and requires further scrutiny. There might be an error in the calculation, or it could reflect a significant underlying issue.
*   **Monitor the performance of KO relative to the S&P 500 closely.** Determine if the recent underperformance is a temporary blip or a longer-term trend.
*   **Consider the analyst consensus cautiously.** While analysts are generally positive, their target prices may not fully reflect the risks indicated by the technical indicators and performance data.
*   **Consider the "Buy" rating generated by the Hybrid Signal with the understanding that it is a conservative approach.** This implies a cautious, long-term investment perspective, rather than an expectation of immediate, high returns.
*   **Due to the conflicting signals (strong financials vs. poor relative performance), a neutral stance is recommended until the negative expected return is resolved.**
