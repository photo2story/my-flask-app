## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Coca-Cola Co (KO) is a multinational beverage corporation and manufacturer, distributor, and marketer of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups.

As of the last data point, KO's cumulative return (48.65%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (118.37%).  The difference is -69.7%, placing it at the 5.3rd percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (-74.4% to 14.3%).  This indicates KO's underperformance relative to the broader market.  The consistently low alpha values across various periods in the provided data further supports this underperformance against the benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $62.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $62.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $63.20

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some recent upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term trend reversal or consolidation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.18 – Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions; the market is relatively neutral.
* **PPO:** 0.25 – A positive value indicates upward momentum, albeit weak.
* **Relative Divergence:** -2.6 – Shows a recent slight downward trend in relative performance compared to the market.
* **Expected Return:** -415.8% – This extremely negative value suggests a significantly lower projected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is an exceptionally pessimistic prediction and requires further scrutiny of the underlying methodology used to arrive at this figure. The extremely low value should raise concerns and warrant further investigation into the model's assumptions.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally remains strong, EPS is volatile.  There is a repetition of the 2024-10-24 data point, which needs clarification.  A consistent analysis requires corrected data.  Overall, it's difficult to form conclusive statements without further information and clarification on the data discrepancies.


| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.66 | $11.85B       |
| 2024-07-29 | $0.56 | $12.36B       |

| 2024-10-24 | $0.71 | $11.95B       | *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals generally healthy profit margins, hovering around 60%, demonstrating the company's profitability.  However, ROE fluctuates, indicating variability in the efficiency of capital usage.  Further analysis is required to understand the reasons behind this fluctuation.


| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin | Equity    | ROE      |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| 2024-09-30  | $11.85B   | 60.65%        | $26.52B  | 10.74%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $12.36B   | 61.08%        | $25.85B  | 9.33%    |
| 2024-03-31  | $11.30B   | 62.52%        | $26.43B  | 12.02%   |
| 2023-12-31  | $10.85B   | 57.29%        | $25.94B  | 7.61%    |
| 2023-09-30  | $11.95B   | 61.04%        | $26.32B  | 11.73%   |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola demonstrates strong profitability with consistent high profit margins.  However, its stock price performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, indicated by both cumulative return and alpha. While recent price movements show some upward momentum, the negative long-term expected return prediction is a serious concern.  The volatility in EPS and ROE requires investigation.  Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to clarify the discrepancies in the provided data (duplicate earnings entry), re-evaluate the methodology behind the -415.8% expected return, and conduct further fundamental and technical analysis. The data suggests a need for caution.  The company's consistent profitability is positive, but the relative underperformance and negative long-term projection are significant red flags.
