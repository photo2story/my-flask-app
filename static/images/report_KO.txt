* 5-day Moving Average: $63.32
* 20-day Moving Average: $62.13
* 60-day Moving Average: $62.68

A long-term investment strategy with a thorough understanding of the risks associated with KO's underperformance relative to the market is recommended. Further investigation into the reasons for underperformance, and the correction of data inconsistencies (duplicate entries), is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.
