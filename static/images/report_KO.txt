**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.66 | $11.85 Billion |
| 2024-07-29 | $0.56 | $12.36 Billion |
| 2024-05-02 | $0.74 | $11.30 Billion |
| 2023-10-24 | $0.71 | $11.95 Billion |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.71 | $11.95 Billion | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*


Earnings show some fluctuation, with revenue generally remaining consistent around $12 billion.  There is a need to clarify the duplicate entry for Oct 24, 2024.  More comprehensive data is needed for a robust analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a thorough financial analysis. This data is crucial for evaluating profitability and overall financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 recently. While short-term indicators suggest some bullish momentum (positive PPO, price above moving averages), the overbought RSI and the extremely negative long-term expected return raise serious concerns. The lack of complete financial data further hinders a comprehensive evaluation.  The negative alpha values across several periods further reinforce underperformance relative to the market. Before investing in KO, a thorough review of the missing financial data and a deeper understanding of the reasons behind the persistent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 are critical.  The extremely negative expected return strongly suggests that, based on this data, investing in a broad market index fund such as VOO would be a preferable alternative over the long term.
