This report analyzes Coca-Cola Co (KO) stock performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and examining its recent financial data and indicators.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coca-Cola Co is a beverage company producing and marketing non-alcoholic beverages worldwide.  The cumulative return of KO is 48.94%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's cumulative return of 119.94%.  The difference is -71.0%, placing it at the 6.6th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (max: +14.3%, min: -77.0%).  This indicates KO has underperformed the S&P 500 considerably over the measured period.  The consistently low Alpha values in the provided data further support this underperformance relative to the market.

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, and significantly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting recent positive momentum.  The positive change from the previous close ($0.75) indicates a short-term uptrend.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -329.8% (This is an extremely negative figure and needs further clarification. It likely represents a significant projected underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, based on the historical data and current trends.  The methodology used to calculate this value should be reviewed and understood.)

**7. Overall Analysis:**

The provided financial data shows relatively stable revenue and high profit margins, but with some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. A thorough analysis considering macroeconomic factors, competitive landscape, and a more robust projection methodology for the long-term expected return is needed before making any investment decisions.  The extremely negative projected return warrants a deep investigation into the methodology used for its calculation.
