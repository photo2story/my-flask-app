**7. Overall Analysis:**

KO has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While its fundamentals (revenue, profit margins) remain relatively strong and stable, the low recent price action combined with a negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests caution. The negative expected return (-344.2%) needs further clarification on the calculation methodology before any reliable conclusions can be drawn. The relatively low RSI and a moderately positive PPO provide mixed signals.   A deeper dive into the macroeconomic environment and competitor analysis, along with a careful review of the methodology behind the -344.2% expected return, are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests a defensive stock that may not participate in broad market rallies.

The reliability of this analysis depends heavily on the accuracy and completeness of the provided data.  The extremely negative expected return figure warrants significant further investigation.
