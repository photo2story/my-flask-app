**2) Recent Price Movement:**

The closing price is 71.87.  The last market price shows a slight decrease (-0.77) to 71.315.  The stock price is trading above its 5-day (70.92), 20-day (69.96), and 60-day (66.57) moving averages, suggesting upward momentum.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4403 suggests a low-to-medium risk level.
* **RSI:** 65.54 indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO:** 0.08 suggests a slight upward momentum.
* **Relative Strength:** The 20-day relative strength change of +5.7 indicates short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** A -25.5% expected return relative to S&P 500 over the long-term (2 years or more) is a significant negative outlook.  This contradicts the positive short-term indicators.  Further investigation is needed to reconcile this discrepancy.  The short-term price drop of -0.77 may partially contribute to this negative outlook.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

KO shows a mixed performance picture. While financial statements suggest strong revenue and profitability, the stock's performance lags behind the S&P 500.  Short-term technical indicators suggest upward momentum, but a significant negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises concerns.  Reconciling the short-term positive indicators with the negative long-term expected return requires further investigation into the factors driving the -25.5% expected return figure and a deeper dive into the company's financials and competitive landscape.  The provided data alone is insufficient to make a definitive investment recommendation.  Additional analysis, considering macroeconomic factors and industry trends, is needed.
