Further analysis is needed to interpret and understand the consistency and causes of these variations.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 15.0% | 0.0% | -13.0% | 0.0 | 158.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

The recent price of KO is $63.48, slightly below its previous close ($64.05).  The price is above its 5-day ($63.32), 20-day ($62.13), and 60-day ($62.68) moving averages, suggesting a slight upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (62.72):** Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment.
* **PPO (0.41):** A positive value suggests a bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A 6.5 point increase in relative divergence over the last 20 days signifies a short-term upward trend.  The recent price decrease (-$0.89) suggests a slight correction from this upward trend rather than a sharp reversal.

**Expected Return (-256.2%):**  This extremely negative expected return needs further clarification.  A negative expected return is highly unusual and likely indicates an error in the calculation or an assumption that is not well-suited for a long-term investment horizon.  Long-term (2+ years) investment decisions should generally consider long-term growth prospects and diversification and not rely on short-term estimates such as this.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Coca-Cola (KO) shows a history of relatively stable profitability and strong margins. However, its recent performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO) is significantly weaker. While the stock's current price is above its recent moving averages and technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment, the significant underperformance compared to the broader market warrants careful consideration. The provided negative expected return should be disregarded, as it is an unreliable indicator for long-term decisions.  A thorough analysis of the underlying factors driving the relative underperformance is crucial before making any investment decision.  This should include examination of macro-economic conditions, industry trends, and specific company-level factors affecting KO.  Considering the conflicting signals across different metrics, further due diligence is recommended before making an investment decision.  The duplicated data point in the earnings report requires correction or explanation.
