| 2023-2025  | 16.0% | 79.6% | -50.0% | 0.2 | 301.6 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Growth rates have been volatile, with periods of strong growth interspersed with periods of very low or even negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** KO has high MDD values, indicating considerable downside risk.
*   **Alpha:** Coca-Cola has significantly negative Alpha values in more recent periods (especially 2023-2025, but also 2022-2024 and 2019-2021), meaning it has underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis during these times.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values range from 0.0 to 0.7 suggesting that it is less volatile than the market. A beta closer to zero indicates that the stock is largely uncorrelated with market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has increased over the period from 197.4B to 301.6B.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 70.07
*   **Previous Close:** 70.16
*   **Change:** -0.13
*   **5-day SMA:** 70.016
*   **20-day SMA:** 70.244
*   **60-day SMA:** 69.8197

**Analysis:**

The stock price is currently hovering around the $70 mark.  The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is also slightly above the 60-day SMA. This *could* indicate a short-term downward trend, but the differences are small, so it is not definitively bearish.

**3. Indicators Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 49.83 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.0994 (Slightly bearish, indicating the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (14 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -6.7 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -286.0 (Very negative long-term outlook compared to S&P 500)
* Change: The small negative change of -0.13 between price and previousClose may mean that there is fluctuation issue in the short term.

**Analysis:**

Despite the high MRI suggesting a relatively safe investment, the very negative expected return is a significant concern. The RSI and PPO are neutral to slightly bearish. The hybrid signal suggests a full buy, however, the expected return outweighs the signal. The recent decline in relative divergence suggests further weakness in the short term.
