**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

Overall, KO is currently experiencing a challenging period with significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500. Despite consistent high profitability and a stable capital structure, the recent stock price decline, negative alpha, and technical indicators signal a potential continuation of the downward trend in the short term.

* **Short-Term:** Avoid buying KO at this time, as the stock may experience further downside in the short term.
* **Long-Term:** For long-term investors with a horizon of 2 years or more, KO may be an attractive addition to a diversified portfolio.
