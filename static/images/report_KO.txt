## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Analysis

This report analyzes Coca-Cola Co (KO), a multinational beverage corporation, based on provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

KO's cumulative return (81.98%) slightly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) return (82.57%) by -0.6 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -0.6 sits at the 63.7th percentile of historical divergence, indicating it's closer to the lower end of the historical range compared to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance against the market (presumably the S&P 500) over different periods.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates, Beta generally hovers around 0.4-0.5, suggesting relatively low market sensitivity.  Alphas, representing excess return over the market, are generally positive, except for the 2022-2024 period, indicating that KO has often outperformed the benchmark over the long term.  However, the relatively low and variable alpha values compared to the substantial size of KO indicate it has not consistently generated substantial alpha. Note that a higher market cap (Cap(B)) is observed over the years.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-05-01 | 0.77   | 11.13 B$     |
| 2024-10-24 | 0.66   | 11.85 B$     |
| 2024-07-29 | 0.56   | 12.36 B$     |

| 2025-05-01 | 0.74   | 11.30 B$     |

There's some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  A noticeable drop in EPS and increase in revenue from Q2 to Q3 2024 warrants further investigation, and the duplicate entry for 2025-05-01 should be clarified.


**5) Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was available.  This lack of crucial financial information significantly limits a thorough fundamental analysis.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

KO's performance has been relatively stable but slightly underperformed the S&P 500 recently.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook, while the long-term outlook is projected to slightly underperform the broader market.  The missing financial data prevents a more comprehensive fundamental evaluation.  Further investigation into the earnings data discrepancies and acquisition of missing financial information is necessary for a robust assessment.  The relatively low and volatile alpha values highlight the relatively low return compared to its substantial market cap.
