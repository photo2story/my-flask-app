Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Coca-Cola (KO) based on the data you've provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (vs. S&P 500)**

*   **Ticker:** KO (Coca-Cola Co)
*   **Overview:** Coca-Cola is a global beverage company known for its iconic soft drinks and diverse portfolio of beverages.
*   **KO Cumulative Return:** 49.08%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.36%
*   **Divergence:** -48.1 (Relative Divergence: 16.1)

**Analysis:**

KO has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period examined.  The negative divergence (-48.1) indicates that KO's return is 48.1 percentage points lower than the S&P 500's return. The relative divergence of 16.1 suggests this level of underperformance is closer to the minimum range of divergence observed historically.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 18.0% | 0.0% | -11.0% | 0.0 | 197.5 |
| 2016-2018  | 10.0% | 71.9% | -5.0% | 0.1 | 203.8 |
| 2017-2019  | 24.0% | 71.9% | 2.0% | 0.4 | 238.3 |
| 2018-2020  | 18.0% | 81.4% | -5.0% | 0.4 | 236.1 |
| 2019-2021  | 28.0% | 81.4% | -19.0% | 0.6 | 254.9 |
| 2020-2022  | 3.0% | 81.4% | 3.0% | 0.7 | 273.8 |
| 2021-2023  | 6.0% | 79.7% | 4.0% | 0.5 | 253.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 0.0% | 79.7% | -21.0% | 0.5 | 268.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 17.0% | 79.6% | -47.0% | 0.2 | 303.6 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuates. Growth has been inconsistent, ranging from 0% to 28%.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values across all periods suggest significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** Mostly negative or low positive Alpha indicates underperformance compared to a risk-free investment or benchmark. Recent Alpha values are particularly negative.
*   **Beta:** Beta values generally below 1 suggest KO is less volatile than the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap has grown over the years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 70.54
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 70.555, Previous Close: 71.95, Change: -1.94
*   **5-day SMA:** 72.348
*   **20-day SMA:** 70.9548
*   **60-day SMA:** 68.623

**Analysis:**

The stock price is currently below both its 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a recent downtrend. The negative change in the last market data reinforces this. However, the 20-day SMA is above the 60-day SMA, which *could* be a sign of a longer-term positive trend, though the current price action counters that.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.12 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.0474 (Slightly Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (14 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -6.8 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -92.0 (Negative outlook)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a high level of safety for investment.
*   The RSI being close to 50 indicates a neutral condition – neither overbought nor oversold.
*   The negative PPO hints at slight bearish momentum.
*   The recent negative change in relative divergence confirms a short-term downward trend compared to the S&P 500.
*   The *very* negative Expected Return suggests a high risk of substantial losses relative to the S&P 500 if held long-term from this point. This is a major red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   Several articles focus on Coca-Cola's stock performance, potential growth in healthier beverages, and institutional investment.

**Analysis:**

*   The news is mixed. Articles discuss past performance and future potential.  The focus on "healthier beverages" suggests a strategic shift to address changing consumer preferences.  The institutional buying could be a positive sign, but it's a single data point.  Crucially, the headlines do not directly address the extremely poor expected return.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.62 (~Buy)
*   **Target Price:** 79.13 (average)

**Analysis:**

Despite the worrying technical and return data, analysts generally have a positive outlook on KO, with a consensus "Buy" rating and a target price significantly above the current price. This creates a strong divergence between analyst sentiment and other indicators.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue    |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-10-23 | 0.86 | 12.46 B$   |
| 2025-07-24 | 0.89 | 12.54 B$   |
| 2025-05-01 | 0.77 | 11.13 B$   |
| 2024-10-24 | 0.66 | 11.85 B$   |
| 2025-10-23 | 0.66 | 11.85 B$   |

**Analysis:**

Earnings per share (EPS) and revenue have generally been increasing over the reported quarters. This suggests a healthy growth trend in Coca-Cola's business. However, there's a duplicated line for 2025-10-23 with 0.66 EPS and 11.85 B$ revenue; this should be corrected as it seems like a data entry error.

*   **Equity:** Increasing, showing strengthening financial position.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

The analysis paints a conflicting picture:

*   **Negative Signals:** KO has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.  The Expected Return is *extremely* negative, suggesting substantial potential losses. Technical indicators show a recent downtrend. The Maximum Drawdown indicates possibility of losing a lot of money.
*   **Positive Signals:** Recent earnings and revenue have been strong. Profit margins are high. Analysts have a "Buy" consensus with a significant price target upside. The Market Risk Indicator suggests a high level of safety.
*   **Conflicting Signals:**  The analyst sentiment and fundamental strength (revenue, profit) clash sharply with the underperformance, negative expected return, and recent technical weakness.

**Conclusion:**

The data suggests caution. While Coca-Cola demonstrates strong fundamentals and analyst optimism, the significant underperformance relative to the market and the alarmingly negative expected return raise serious concerns.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Investigate the Discrepancy:**  The enormous gap between the analyst's target price/recommendation and the expected return/historical underperformance needs to be understood. Is there a fundamental flaw in the expected return calculation? Are analysts overly optimistic?
2.  **Further Technical Analysis:** Conduct a deeper technical analysis, examining long-term trends and potential support/resistance levels.
3.  **Risk Tolerance:** Consider your own risk tolerance.  Even with positive analyst sentiment, the negative expected return suggests this investment might not be suitable for risk-averse investors.
4.  **Look for Catalysts:** Identify potential catalysts that could drive future growth or correct the underperformance.
