**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $69.93
* **Previous Close:** $73.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $67.11

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.  The significant daily price drop of -$4.44 indicates a potential short-term bearish trend.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 49.22 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)

* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +16.4% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -9.5% (Short-term negative expected return)

The relatively high MRI suggests caution, even with some positive technical indicators. The significant daily price drop should be considered a relevant risk factor.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not explicitly given beyond the 2.93% outperformance at the last data point. Further analysis is needed to estimate future long-term outperformance.
