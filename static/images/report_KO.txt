**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola shows a strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, often exhibiting positive alpha.  However, the recent data reveals some concerns. The negative CAGR and MDD in the 2022-2024 period highlight vulnerability to market downturns. While short-term indicators suggest positive momentum, the projected long-term underperformance against the S&P 500 warrants careful consideration.  Further analysis, incorporating more complete and consistent financial data, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The company's consistent revenue and strong profit margins, along with generally good ROE, are positive aspects, but the risk profile should be fully evaluated.
