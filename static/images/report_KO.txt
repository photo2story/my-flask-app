* **20-Day Moving Average:** $71.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.92

* **PPO:** 0.33 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +9.5 (Short-term uptrend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -3.4% (This suggests that even with outperformance against the S&P 500 in the past, a long-term investment in KO might yield slightly less than the S&P 500 over the next two years. This is a projection based on incomplete data and should not be the sole basis for an investment decision.)

The indicators suggest a relatively healthy market position for KO, although the negative expected return warrants caution regarding long-term outperformance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola (KO) has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, reflected in its higher cumulative return and relative divergence.  Current technical indicators suggest a positive short-term trend, although the long-term expected return is slightly negative compared to the S&P 500.  Financial data reveals consistent profitability and healthy equity levels.  However, the analysis is limited by incomplete and potentially erroneous data (duplicate earnings entry).  Further investigation into data inconsistencies and a more comprehensive analysis considering macroeconomic factors and competitor performance are crucial for a complete investment decision.  The negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 suggests caution; while KO has historically outperformed, the projection for future outperformance is not guaranteed.
