## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Review

This report analyzes Coca-Cola Co (KO), a global beverage company producing and distributing non-alcoholic beverages.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

KO's cumulative return (48.88%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (122.07%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -73.2%, placing it at the 1.2 percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates KO's underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a slightly positive, but marginal, outperformance relative to the market's beta after accounting for market risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 62.64 (Last Market: 63.63)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 62.72
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 62.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 66.33

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The difference between the last market price and the closing price (63.63 vs 62.64) indicates a slight recent dip.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.14 (slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions).
* **PPO:** 0.19 (positive, indicating bullish momentum, but relatively weak).
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +1.2 (short-term upward trend).

The relatively low PPO and neutral RSI suggest that while there's some short-term upward momentum, the overall trend isn't strongly bullish. The expected return of 0.0% represents the expected excess return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, implying minimal outperformance. Given the recent price dip (63.63 to 62.64), a minor correction could be underway.  Significant further price drops should be observed with caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's no clear upward or downward trend apparent from just these few data points.

* **Revenue:** Shows some fluctuation but no consistent upward or downward trend is evident from this limited data.
* **EPS:** Exhibits similar volatility to revenue, making it difficult to establish a clear trend without further data.

To draw more meaningful conclusions, a longer time frame of data is needed.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates, and profit margin is generally high but shows some quarter-to-quarter variation, suggesting potential sensitivity to market conditions.  A slight downward trend in revenue and profit margin is apparent in the last two quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable. ROE fluctuates, reflecting changes in profitability.  Again, more data is necessary to determine long-term trends.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to provide a comprehensive analysis.  This data was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While some positive short-term indicators are present (relative strength change), the overall picture suggests cautious optimism.  The recent price dip is a concern.  The inconsistent earnings data and the lack of information on recent news and analyst opinions limit the scope of this analysis. A more complete picture requires additional data, particularly a longer historical dataset for financial performance and current market sentiment. The expected return of 0% implies minimal outperformance relative to the broader market over the long term. Long-term investors should monitor market conditions, and consider diversifying holdings rather than overweighting Coca-Cola.
