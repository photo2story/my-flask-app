## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

Coca-Cola Co (KO) is a multinational beverage corporation and manufacturer, distributor, and marketer of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups.  This report analyzes KO's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and assessing its financial health and future prospects.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

KO's cumulative return is 77.98%, while the S&P 500's is 87.98%.  Therefore, KO underperformed the S&P 500 by **-10.0 percentage points** at the data's cut-off point.  The relative underperformance of -10.0% sits at the 49.5th percentile of the historical range (-42.9% to +23.5%), indicating it's relatively closer to the average historical underperformance than extreme levels.


The provided alpha and beta analysis shows mixed results across different periods. While Alpha (a measure of excess return compared to the market) is generally positive, suggesting outperformance in certain years, the Beta (a measure of volatility relative to the market) remains relatively stable between 0.0 and 0.5, suggesting lower volatility than the market in some years. The company's market capitalization has steadily increased.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $71.17
* **Last Market Price:** $70.52 (Down $0.91 from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $71.73
* **20-day Moving Average:** $72.11
* **60-day Moving Average:** $70.67

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent price drop of -$0.91, while not drastically significant, does contribute to this bearish sentiment.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.31 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.27 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -8.6% (This represents a short-term prediction and contradicts long-term accumulation strategy)


The combination of a low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests a bearish short-term outlook.  However, the relatively low MRI indicates a moderate level of market risk. The negative expected return of -8.6% should be considered cautiously, especially given the long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

KO's recent performance shows a mixed picture. While the company enjoys high profit margins and a strong brand, its short-term price movement indicates bearish sentiment. The negative expected return highlights short-term challenges.  However, the relatively low market risk and long-term growth potential suggest that a long-term investment approach, considering potential market fluctuations and the inherent risks, may be suitable for risk-tolerant investors.  Further analysis is needed to resolve data inconsistencies and better understand the long-term growth trajectory, especially concerning the recent earnings fluctuations.  The -8.6% short-term expected return needs further clarification and should not be the sole basis for long-term investment decisions.
