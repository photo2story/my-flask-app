## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Review

This report analyzes Coca-Cola Co (KO), a global beverage company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coca-Cola's cumulative return (48.26%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (117.56%) over the measured period.  The difference is -69.3%, placing it at the 5.6th percentile of its historical relative performance range (-74.3% to 14.4%).  This indicates KO underperformed VOO considerably during the time frame considered.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $62.38
* **Last Market Price:** $62.84
* **5-day Moving Average:** $62.726
* **20-day Moving Average:** $63.1052
* **60-day Moving Average:** $65.2625

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The difference between the last market price and closing price is minimal, indicating limited recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 42.52 (Below 50, suggesting the stock may be oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.0845 (Positive, indicating a bullish trend, but weak)
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** +4.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests that over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years), the expected return relative to the S&P 500 is neutral.  This should be viewed with caution given the low expectation)

The combination of a low RSI, a weak positive PPO, and a recent short-term uptrend suggests potential for price movement in either direction. The 0.0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 reinforces the underperformance previously observed.  The slightly higher last market price compared to closing price might reflect short term optimism, but lacks significant weight.  No significant price jumps or drops are immediately evident.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both revenue and EPS:

* **Revenue:** Shows some fluctuation, without a clear upward or downward trend over the reported quarters.  No significant pattern is observable given the limited dataset.
* **EPS:** Also shows fluctuations, with no immediately apparent trend.  Comparing quarters directly, there's no consistency in EPS growth or decline.

The provided data doesn't allow for a robust analysis of whether any earnings beat or missed expectations since no expected figures are given.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates slightly, but profit margins are generally high and relatively stable, though declining slightly in recent quarters.  This suggests a strong, but possibly slightly weakening, position.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows some fluctuation. ROE is generally positive but shows volatility, indicating some uncertainty in the company's profitability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information. No news or recent market outlook and analyst opinions are provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola currently shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  While it maintains high profit margins, recent financial data reveals some volatility in revenue and EPS, and ROE. The technical indicators present a mixed signal, with potential for movement in either direction. The lack of recent news and detailed analyst opinions hinders a complete assessment. The 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and should prompt additional investigation.  More comprehensive data (including expectations data and news) is needed for a more conclusive analysis.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current data,  a more in-depth analysis is required before making investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons for underperformance versus the S&P 500, and a deeper dive into future expectations is warranted. The current data alone does not provide sufficient information to recommend a buy, sell, or hold strategy.  More data, especially concerning analyst outlooks and recent news, is needed for a complete evaluation.
