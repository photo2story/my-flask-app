**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

KO's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly. While the company shows strong profitability and relatively stable financial metrics, the current price is below key moving averages, and technical indicators point towards a bearish short-term trend. The exceptionally negative long-term expected return (-267%) relative to the S&P 500 requires further scrutiny.  The inconsistencies in the earnings data and the need for clarification on the expected return calculation highlight the limitations of this analysis.  More data and a deeper investigation into the valuation metrics are necessary for a more comprehensive and robust assessment.


**8. Disclaimer:** This analysis is based on limited data and should not be considered financial advice.  Independent research and consultation with a financial professional are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The extremely negative projected long-term return requires critical examination of the inputs and methodology used to arrive at this result.
