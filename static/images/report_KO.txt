## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Coca-Cola Co (KO), a multinational beverage corporation and manufacturer, distributor, and marketer of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

KO's cumulative return is 65.36%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) achieved 108.99%.  This results in a current return difference of -43.6%.  Considering the historical range of the difference (max: 14.3%, min: -77.0%), the current relative divergence is 36.6%, meaning KO's underperformance is in the 37th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows mixed results. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies year to year, the alpha (measure of excess return over the market) is generally positive, suggesting outperformance in several periods. However, the beta (a measure of volatility relative to the market) is relatively low and stable across the periods, indicating lower risk than the overall market.  It's noteworthy that periods of positive alpha often correspond to higher MDD (Maximum Drawdown).

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $70.19
* **Previous Close:** $72.32
* **Change:** -$2.13 (a -2.94% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $68.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $64.46

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support.  The recent price drop is significant enough to warrant attention.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 61.7 –  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral short-term outlook.
* **PPO:** 0.02 – A slightly positive PPO suggests some upward momentum, but it's very close to neutral.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.0 –  Suggests short-term upward price movement.  This contrasts with the recent price drop; further analysis is needed to reconcile this discrepancy.
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500 over 2+ years):** -39.0% –  This suggests a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term. This negative projection warrants closer investigation into the underlying reasons.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While revenue generally stays above $11B, EPS fluctuates without a clear trend.  The duplication of the 2024-10-24 entry needs clarification.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.66 | $11.85 B    |
| 2024-07-29 | $0.56 | $12.36 B    |
| 2024-05-02 | $0.74 | $11.30 B    |
| 2023-10-24 | $0.71 | $11.95 B    |
| 2024-10-24 | $0.71 | $11.95 B    | *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, but there is a slight downward trend in recent quarters. Profit margins are consistently high, averaging above 60%.  ROE (Return on Equity) shows some fluctuation, but generally stays above 8%.


| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity    | ROE   |
|-------------|------------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| 2024-12-31  | $11.54B    | 60.04%        | $24.86B   | 8.83% |
| 2024-09-30  | $11.85B    | 60.65%        | $26.52B   | 10.74%|
| 2024-06-30  | $12.36B    | 61.08%        | $25.85B   | 9.33% |
| 2024-03-31  | $11.30B    | 62.52%        | $26.43B   | 12.02%|
| 2023-12-31  | $10.85B    | 57.29%        | $25.94B   | 7.61% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

KO shows mixed signals. While it boasts high profit margins and strong financial fundamentals, its recent performance lags behind the S&P 500.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is concerning.  The recent price drop, coupled with the mixed technical indicators, suggests caution.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and to reconcile the discrepancies between technical indicators and recent price action, especially the discrepancy between the positive short-term relative divergence and the recent price decline. A deeper dive into macroeconomic factors, competitive landscape analysis, and future growth prospects is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate data entry in the earnings report also needs clarification.
