* **5-Day Moving Average:** $64.49

The large price increase from the previous day ('change' value) likely contributes to the negative projected return by highlighting recent volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some variability in both EPS and revenue.  There appears to be an error in the data as 2024-10-24 appears twice.  A more consistent analysis would require further investigation and clarifying these duplicated data points.

| 날짜        | EPS | 매출      |
|-------------|-----|-----------|
| 2024-10-24  | 0.66 | 11.85 B$  |

Revenue is relatively stable, though slightly lower in Q4 2023. Profit margins are generally high and consistent, demonstrating strong profitability.  Equity has seen some fluctuation, and ROE (Return on Equity) also shows variability, suggesting fluctuations in profitability and efficiency of capital usage.


| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $11.85B  | 60.65%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $12.36B  | 61.08%        |

| 2024-06-30 | $25.85B   | 9.33%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $26.43B   | 12.02% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

KO has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent price action shows a sharp increase and positive momentum indicators (PPO), the high RSI suggests potential short-term correction.  The extremely negative projected long-term return (-101.5%) requires further investigation and likely stems from the recent price jump being a significant outlier.  The company shows consistent profitability, but there is variability in earnings and efficiency metrics.  A deeper dive into the data and its context is needed before drawing definitive conclusions.  The duplicated data points in the earnings data also need clarification.  Investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties before making any investment decisions.
