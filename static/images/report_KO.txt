## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Coca-Cola Co (KO) is a beverage company that produces, manufactures, and markets non-alcoholic beverages worldwide.

The provided data shows KO's cumulative return at 46.78% versus the S&P 500 (VOO) at 122.16%.  This results in a significant negative divergence of -75.4%.  The relative divergence of 1.8% indicates that KO's performance relative to the S&P 500 is near its historical low point based on the provided range (-77.0% to 14.3%).  The consistently low alpha values across the periods suggest KO's performance has largely tracked the market, rather than significantly outperforming it.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $61.92
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $61.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $62.83

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  The recent price change of $0.63 (1.03%) suggests a slight upward movement in the last trading day but not significant enough to negate the downward trend indicated by the moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.63 - This suggests the stock is near neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO:** 0.14 - A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -4.6% - Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -1295.4% - This extremely negative value suggests a highly pessimistic outlook for future outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), given current conditions.  This warrants further investigation.  The value appears unrealistically low and may be an error in the calculation or data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent, with duplicate entries for 2024-10-24.  Assuming the duplicate is an error, the remaining data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue, with no clear upward or downward trend over the last four quarters.  A more detailed analysis requires complete and consistent data.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue       |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 0.66 | $11.85B       |
| 2024-07-29 | 0.56 | $12.36B       |
| 2024-05-02 | 0.74 | $11.30B       |
| 2023-10-24 | 0.71 | $11.95B       |


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data shows relatively stable revenue with some quarterly fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high, generally above 60%, although there is a slight dip in Q4 2023.  ROE also shows some volatility, suggesting variations in profitability and efficiency.  Overall, the financial health appears relatively strong, despite the recent market underperformance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola's current situation presents a mixed picture.  While the company demonstrates consistent profitability and strong financial fundamentals, its stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The negative long-term expected return against the S&P 500 is alarming and needs further investigation to determine the source of this prediction.  Technical indicators present a near-neutral outlook.  Short-term price action suggests a possible downward trend, while recent earnings show some variability but don't reveal a clear negative trend.  A thorough review of the extremely negative expected return prediction and further investigation of the earnings data is necessary to arrive at a comprehensive assessment.  More data, such as industry benchmarks and competitor analysis, will further refine this analysis.
