The relative underperformance is at the 9.1 percentile of the historical range (-74.4% to 14.3%).  This means KO's current underperformance is relatively low compared to its historical underperformance against VOO.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $61.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $62.25

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **Recent Relative Strength Change:** +4.1 (Short-term upward momentum.)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -227.9% (This is a strikingly negative figure suggesting a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over a two-year timeframe.  This projection requires further scrutiny as it seems exceptionally low.  The methodology behind this calculation needs to be reviewed to ensure its accuracy and validity.)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistency (duplicate entry for 2024-10-24).  Ignoring the duplicate, the data suggests some volatility in both EPS and revenue:

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.66 | $11.85        |
| 2024-07-29 | $0.56 | $12.36        |
| 2024-05-02 | $0.74 | $11.30        |
| 2023-10-24 | $0.71 | $11.95        |


A more complete picture would require analyzing trends over multiple years and understanding factors influencing variations in both EPS and revenue.


**5. Financial Information (Revenue and Profitability)**

| Quarter     | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $11.85        | 60.65%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $12.36        | 61.08%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $11.30        | 62.52%        |

| 2023-09-30  | $11.95        | 61.04%        |

Profit margins are generally high and consistent, although there's some fluctuation.  Revenue shows some volatility as well, requiring further investigation into market conditions and company strategies.


**5. Financial Information (Capital and Profitability)**

| Quarter     | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | $26.52       | 10.74   |
| 2024-06-30  | $25.85       | 9.33    |
| 2024-03-31  | $26.43       | 12.02   |
| 2023-12-31  | $25.94       | 7.61    |
| 2023-09-30  | $26.32       | 11.73   |

Equity and ROE show some fluctuation, but overall remain relatively stable.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying drivers.


**7. Overall Analysis**

KO has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While the company exhibits generally high profit margins, recent price action suggests potential downward pressure.  The negative long-term expected return (-227.9%) is highly concerning and needs clarification regarding its calculation. Technical indicators are mixed, with RSI suggesting potential oversold conditions but PPO indicating bearish momentum.  Earnings show some volatility.  A deeper dive into macroeconomic factors, competitive landscape, and Coca-Cola's strategic initiatives is necessary for a comprehensive investment decision.  The extremely negative long-term expected return should be critically examined and the calculation validated before any investment decisions are made.  The data is insufficient to conclusively recommend or avoid KO.
