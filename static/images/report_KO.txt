The difference is -73.7%, placing it at the 2.2nd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (based on provided data).  This indicates considerable underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance relative to the market across different time periods.  The alpha consistently shows near zero, indicating its returns are closely aligned with market movements (beta also indicates this).

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** NaN (-): Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests that, based on the provided data,  long-term (2+ years) accumulation investment is not expected to significantly outperform the S&P 500.
