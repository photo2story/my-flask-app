**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola (KO) has shown inconsistent performance compared to the S&P 500. While it displays relatively strong profit margins and revenue, its return has lagged behind the market significantly. Short-term indicators suggest a positive trend, but the long-term outlook needs careful consideration, particularly concerning the extremely negative long-term expected return (-199.5%) which requires further analysis to understand the assumptions behind this projection.  The volatility in alpha, beta, and financial ratios highlight the need for a deeper dive into underlying factors impacting the company's performance before making any investment decisions.  A thorough examination of the -199.5% expected return projection is crucial, as it significantly deviates from what might be reasonably expected from a blue-chip stock like KO.  More data and context are necessary for a comprehensive evaluation.
