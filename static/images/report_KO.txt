Coca-Cola (KO) is currently underperforming the S&P 500, and its stock price shows signs of a short-term downtrend.  However, several factors suggest potential for future upside:

*   **Solid Financials:** The company has strong profit margins, increasing equity, and improving ROE.
*   **Dividend King Status:** The company's long history of increasing dividends makes it attractive to income-seeking investors.

**In conclusion:**  While KO has faced recent headwinds and is underperforming the market, the combination of potentially oversold conditions, positive analyst sentiment, and solid financials suggests that it might be a reasonable investment, especially for investors seeking a stable dividend-paying stock and willing to hold for the long term. However, the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 should be considered. Also, the recent negative news/sell-off is something to consider before investing.
