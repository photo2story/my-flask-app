## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Coca-Cola Co (KO) is a multinational beverage corporation and manufacturer, distributor, and marketer of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups.  The provided data shows KO's cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons for this underperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **KO Cumulative Return:** 67.53%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 112.87%
* **Return Difference:** -45.34%  (KO underperformed VOO by 45.34% based on the final day's cumulative returns).
* **Relative Divergence:** 34.7% (This means KO's underperformance is at the 34.7th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO.  It's not necessarily a negative signal in isolation but warrants further investigation.)

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed performance relative to the market (VOO). While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is positive across most periods, Alpha is often positive, suggesting outperformance in some years, but Beta is relatively stable around 1, indicating similar volatility to the market.  However, the significant negative Alpha in 2015-2017 and the consistently lower CAGR than VOO, despite relatively lower MDD (Maximum Drawdown) in some periods, raise concerns.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $70.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $67.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $64.08

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term uptrend. The recent price change of $0.09 (approximately 0.1%) is minor and doesn't signal any significant immediate price change (no evidence of a sharp uptrend or downtrend).


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 82.01 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.39 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +12.2% (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -42.2% (This suggests a significantly lower return than the S&P 500 over the long term. This is a critical piece of information requiring careful consideration)

The high RSI and significantly negative expected return raise some concerns. Although positive PPO and relative divergence suggest current short-term bullishness, the long-term outlook is considerably negative compared to the benchmark.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $0.66  | $11.85B      |

| 2024-10-24 | $0.71  | $11.95B      | *(Duplicate entry - likely an error)*

Revenue shows some fluctuation but remains relatively stable around $11-12B.  EPS is also volatile, indicating inconsistent profitability.  The duplicated entry needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2023-12-31 | $10.85B | 57.29%       |

Profit margins are generally high and stable, indicating strong profitability. Revenue shows a slight downward trend.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| 2023-12-31 | $25.94B | 7.61%    |

Equity fluctuates but generally remains high. ROE is relatively strong but shows some volatility.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

KO shows strong fundamentals with high profit margins and relatively stable revenue. However, the significantly lower return compared to the S&P 500 (-45.34%) and the projected negative long-term alpha (-42.2%) are major concerns. While short-term indicators like the PPO and 20-day relative divergence suggest positive momentum, the overbought RSI and the long-term underperformance compared to the market raise serious questions about the future prospects.  The inconsistent EPS and the need to clarify the duplicated earnings data further complicate the analysis.  More research is needed to determine if the current valuation is justified and if long-term investment in KO is advisable compared to investing in the broader market through VOO.  The negative expected return is a significant red flag requiring more detailed investigation of the underlying assumptions.
