## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Review

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Coca-Cola Co (KO) is a beverage company producing and distributing non-alcoholic beverages worldwide.  KO's cumulative return of 48.19% significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 121.38%.  The current divergence is -73.6%, indicating KO's underperformance relative to the market.  This is close to the minimum historical divergence of -74.3%.  The relative divergence of 0.8 suggests KO's performance is significantly lagging the market benchmark.


**2) Recent Stock Price:**

The closing price is $62.53 (Last market: $62.63).


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and Revenue.

* **Latest Quarterly Results Comparison:** The most recent quarter (2024-10-24) shows a lower EPS ($0.66) compared to the previous quarter (2024-07-29, $0.56) but still lower than the quarter before that (2024-05-02, $0.74). Revenue also fluctuates, with $11.85B in 2024-10-24, $12.36B in 2024-07-29, and $11.30B in 2024-05-02. Note that there's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24. I'll assume this is a mistake and will use only one of these entries.

* **Revenue Growth Trends:** Revenue shows inconsistency, not exhibiting a clear upward or downward trend.

* **EPS Trends and Significant Changes:** EPS also fluctuates, without a clear trend.  There's no readily apparent pattern or significant changes to highlight.

* **Beats or Misses:** The provided data doesn't include expected EPS or revenue figures, so no comparison to expectations can be made.


**5) Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, fluctuating around $11-12B. Profit margins are generally high (above 60%), although there is some minor fluctuation quarter to quarter. The decline in profit margin from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024, and again in Q4 2023, could suggest external market pressures or operational inefficiencies.  More analysis would be needed to pinpoint the exact causes.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable around $26B. ROE shows some volatility but is generally positive, suggesting the company is generating returns on its investment.  The fluctuation in ROE mirrors the variability observed in profit margins, likely influenced by similar factors.


**6) News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires access to real-time news sources and financial analyst reports to provide information on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This analysis cannot be completed without access to such information.


**7) Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola's stock performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While the company maintains strong profit margins and generally stable revenue, the inconsistent quarterly earnings and fluctuating ROE raise concerns. Further investigation into the reasons behind these fluctuations, as well as consideration of external market factors and analyst opinions (information missing from the provided data), are necessary for a complete assessment of the company's financial health and future prospects. The lack of information on earnings expectations prevents a detailed assessment of the company's performance relative to market expectations.  The missing news and analyst data significantly limits the depth of this analysis.


**8)  Additional Notes:**

The provided data contains inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-10-24).  Clean, complete, and consistent data is crucial for accurate analysis.  Furthermore, access to additional information such as analyst reports, news articles, and competitor analysis would allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of KO's performance and future outlook.
