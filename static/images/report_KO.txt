**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Coca-Cola (KO) has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, as indicated by the large negative divergence. The Alpha, Beta analysis also supports this, as KO's alpha is generally negative. Recent earnings and financial data show positive trends in revenue, EPS, profit margins, and equity, indicating a fundamentally healthy company. Analyst opinions are generally positive, with a consensus "Buy" rating and a target price above the current level. The stock's RSI is nearing oversold territory, and there's been a short-term increase in the relative divergence, but this is still near the lower end. Recent news highlights Coca-Cola as a dividend stock and mentions potential upside from analysts.

**In summary:** While KO has underperformed the market recently, its financial performance is solid. The analyst consensus is "Buy" it. Be cautious with the data "Expected Return", I believe this is wrong. Consider the news regarding lawsuit risk, and the Costa Coffee sale. Based on the analyst targets and dividend-focused perception, KO is likely valued as a long-term, relatively low-risk investment with reasonable upside.
