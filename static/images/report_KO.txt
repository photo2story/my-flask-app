## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Coca-Cola Co (KO) stock performance based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coca-Cola Co is a multinational beverage corporation and manufacturer, distributor, and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups.  The provided data shows that KO's cumulative return (49.77%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's cumulative return (124.78%).  The difference is -75.01%, placing it at the 78th percentile of its historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  The CAGR figures in the provided table also show variable returns, lower than the S&P 500 performance over the selected periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $61.86 (Last Market: $62.09)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $64.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.89

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the last market price indicates limited recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 18.64 – This indicates the stock is significantly oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.33 – This suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -10.84 – Shows a recent downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% –  The provided data suggests no expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment,  assuming a continuation of the current trend.  This, however, is not a reliable prediction for the future.  Given the already low return and oversold status, an improved outlook would be needed to support such a long-term strategy.
* **Last Market Price Consideration:** The last market price of $62.09, slightly higher than the closing price, does not indicate a significant price jump or drop; further data would be needed to conclude on a trend change.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data reveals fluctuating EPS and revenue figures.  While some quarters show strong revenue, others experience a dip.  The most recent quarter (2024-10-24) shows EPS of $0.66 and revenue of $11.85B, which requires comparison to analyst estimates and market expectations to accurately assess its performance.  Note that there is a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24 in the provided data.

**5.  Quarterly Financial Data Analysis (Revenue and Profitability & Capital and Profitability):**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Shows relatively stable revenue, with slight fluctuations but generally high profit margins (above 57%). Profit margins show some fluctuations but remain relatively stable.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity shows moderate fluctuation. ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, indicating varying profitability in relation to shareholders' equity, but showing generally positive ROE and positive performance overall.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

(This section requires access to real-time news sources like Shacknews and Finbold.  Please provide me with any specific news articles relevant to Coca-Cola Co for the past two days so I can include an analysis.)  Information regarding recent market outlook, analyst opinions and performance highlights needs to be gathered from the referenced sources.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola Co (KO) currently exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. Technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest the stock is oversold, indicating potential for a bounce. However, the recent downtrend, negative relative divergence, and low expected return raise concerns.  While the company shows generally stable financial performance with consistent revenue and high-profit margins, the stock's relative underperformance requires careful consideration.  Further analysis of recent news, analyst opinions, and comparison of actual results to analyst estimates for the most recent quarter are crucial for forming a well-informed investment decision.


**8. Investment Recommendation:**

Based on the current data, a long-term investment in KO requires a cautious approach. The stock's significant underperformance relative to the market and the uncertainty surrounding its future prospects, without the inclusion of external research, suggest a wait-and-see approach until further information becomes available.  The oversold condition suggests a potential for a short-term rebound, but a long-term investment decision requires a deeper dive into recent news, analyst projections and a better understanding of the reasons for the underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
