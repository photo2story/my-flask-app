Coca-Cola Co (KO), a global beverage company producing and distributing non-alcoholic beverages, shows a cumulative return of 48.26% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 117.56% over the analyzed period.  This results in a current divergence of -69.3%, placing it at the 5.6th percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500 (min: -74.3%, max: 14.4%).

* **Closing Price:** $62.38
* **Last Market Price:** $62.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $63.11
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $65.26

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The difference between the last market price and the closing price is minimal, indicating relatively stable trading.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 42.52 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** 0.0845 (Positive, but close to zero, indicating weak momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.2% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0%  This suggests that based on the provided data, there’s no expectation of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 in a long-term (2+ years) buy-and-hold strategy.

The relatively low RSI and close-to-zero PPO, coupled with the price being below its moving averages, reinforce a cautious outlook.  The positive 20-day relative divergence change hints at a potential short-term upward correction.  A significant gap between the last market price ($62.84) and the closing price ($62.38) would suggest a rapid price movement (either up or down) is not present in this data.
