Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Coca-Cola (KO) based on the data provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** KO (Coca-Cola Co) - Overview: A global beverage company, primarily known for its carbonated soft drinks.
*   **KO Cumulative Return:** 40.18%

*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during each period. The MDD has increased in recent periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Measures the investment's performance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500).  More recent periods show negative Alpha, indicating underperformance compared to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Measures the investment's volatility relative to the market. A Beta around 0.5 or lower suggests that the stock is less volatile than the market, which is typical for a stable company like Coca-Cola. The beta of 0.1 in the most recent period (2023-2025) could indicate very low sensitivity to market movements.
*   **Cap(B) Market Capitalization (Billions):**  Generally increasing, indicating overall growth in the company's market value.

*   **Previous Close:** 69.91
*   **Change:** -1.13
*   **5-day SMA:** 69.826
*   **20-day SMA:** 70.119
*   **60-day SMA:** 69.972

**Analysis:** The stock price has slightly decreased recently. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, potentially indicating a short-term downward trend or at least a lack of upward momentum.

*   **RSI:** 50.09 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.1587 (Slightly bearish)

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.7 (+): Short-term rise
*   **Expected Return (%):** -158.2

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, indicating a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 50 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The PPO is slightly negative, indicating a slight downward trend in momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy with very safe characteristics. This contrasts strongly with the "Expected Return" value below.
*   **Relative Divergence:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a potential short-term rebound compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The very negative expected return is concerning and requires further investigation. It suggests that, based on the model used, Coca-Cola is expected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term. It's important to understand the model's assumptions and limitations.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** Coca-Cola has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, though the relative divergence suggests that this underperformance is near its historical extremes.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators and news headlines present a mixed picture.  While there's a hint of a short-term rebound in some indicators, other indicators point to continued caution, particularly the very negative "Expected Return". The recent layoff announcement also contributes to uncertainty.
*   **Strong Fundamentals:** Despite recent underperformance, Coca-Cola possesses strong financial fundamentals, including consistent revenue, high profit margins, growing equity, and healthy ROE.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts maintain a "Buy" rating and a price target above the current market price, suggesting potential upside.
*   **Earnings Growth:** Recent earnings reports show increasing EPS and revenue, indicating positive growth trends.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** It is important to further investigate the reason for the "Expected Return" because its value stands in stark contrast with the "Hybrid Signal" and analyst opinions. There may be an error in the calculation of "Expected Return" or there are other factors beyond what is contained in this report which have driven the calculation.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the data, a cautious approach is warranted. While Coca-Cola has strong fundamentals and analysts are optimistic, the recent underperformance, negative "Expected Return", and mixed signals from technical indicators should give investors pause. Further research into the "Expected Return" calculation is necessary before making any investment decision.
