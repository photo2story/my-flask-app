## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coca-Cola Co (KO) is a multinational beverage corporation and manufacturer, distributor, and marketer of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups.  The provided data shows KO's cumulative return at 49.48% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 123.86%.  The difference is -74.38%, placing it at the 1.48 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates a substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows variable alpha (ranging from 0.4 to 0.7) and relatively stable beta (around 0.5-0.7), suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance against the market.  The relatively low beta generally indicates lower volatility than the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $61.74
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.77
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $65.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $69.01

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (14.22):**  This extremely low RSI value indicates the stock is severely oversold.  It suggests a potential bounce, but not necessarily a sustained uptrend.

* **PPO (-0.36):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-12.8%):**  Indicates a recent downward trend.

* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided expected return of 0% suggests no significant outperformance is expected relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. This needs further investigation considering the oversold condition.  The absence of a defined horizon for this projection is limiting.

* **Price Consideration:** The closing price of $61.73 is not significantly different from the last market price and doesn't suggest a dramatic recent price movement (no sharp up or down).

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided quarterly data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally fluctuates around $12B, EPS shows some variation.  The most recent EPS (0.66) is lower than the preceding quarter, though there's no information available regarding analyst expectations for comparison.  Further analysis with consensus estimates is needed for a robust assessment of the results.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |

| 2024-10-24 | 0.66 | 11.85         |
| 2024-07-29 | 0.56 | 12.36         |

**5. Financial Statement Analysis:**

**1) Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins show some fluctuation, reaching a high of 62.52% in Q1 2024 and a low of 57.29% in Q4 2023. This fluctuation requires further investigation to determine the underlying causes.

**2) Capital and Profitability:**  ROE fluctuates but generally remains in a moderate range.  Thereâ€™s no alarming trend, although more context is needed for definitive conclusions.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  The report lacks crucial information on recent news, earnings announcements (beyond the provided EPS and revenue data), and analyst opinions. To provide a comprehensive analysis, information from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD, along with analyst ratings and forecasts, is essential.


**7. Overall Analysis (Summary of 1-6):**

KO is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly, showing a negative alpha. While the stock is technically oversold (low RSI), negative PPO and downward moving averages suggest a bearish momentum.  Recent financial results show some volatility, requiring further analysis in context with analyst expectations and macro-economic factors. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more conclusive assessment. More data is required, particularly regarding the most recent earnings, analyst ratings, and market outlooks, to form a complete investment thesis.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the limited data and the considerable underperformance relative to the S&P 500, a cautious approach is advised.  Before making any investment decision, it is crucial to:

* **Obtain recent news and analyst reports:** Investigate recent earnings calls, news articles, and analyst ratings to understand the market's current perception of KO's prospects.
* **Analyze the macro-economic context:** Consider broader economic factors that might be impacting KO's performance.
* **Compare with peers:** Examine the performance of Coca-Cola's competitors to understand its relative position in the market.
* **Consider risk tolerance:** Evaluate the level of risk you are willing to accept before investing in a stock that has underperformed the market substantially.

The oversold condition warrants attention, but it doesn't guarantee an immediate rebound.  A comprehensive analysis including the missing data points is vital before any investment recommendation can be made.
