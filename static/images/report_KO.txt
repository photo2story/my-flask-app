However,  it's crucial to note the volatility in alpha and the significant negative alpha in 2022-2024. While long-term outperformance potential *exists*, it's not guaranteed and further in-depth analysis is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The provided data requires clarification regarding duplicate earnings entries and requires a broader historical context for a complete investment assessment.
