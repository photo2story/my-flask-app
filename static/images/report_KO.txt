* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $67.11

The -4.44 price change contributes to the negative expected return.  Further analysis is required to determine if this drop represents a buying opportunity or a continuation of a negative trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

KO has shown a slightly better cumulative return than the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, but the recent price drop and negative expected return raise concerns. While historical relative performance has been strong, recent indicators suggest a higher market risk and potential short-term bearish trend.  The inconsistent performance across different timeframes, as highlighted by the Alpha and Beta analysis, warrants further investigation into the company's fundamentals and market positioning.  The substantial price drop needs further explanation to determine if it's a temporary dip or indicative of a broader negative trend. Long-term investors should carefully consider the -9.5% expected return relative to the S&P 500 before committing funds.  Additional research into the inconsistencies in earnings data is essential before drawing definite conclusions.
