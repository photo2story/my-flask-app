## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Coca-Cola Co (KO) is a beverage company that manufactures and distributes non-alcoholic beverages worldwide.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 51.83% for KO, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 121.09%.  The difference in cumulative return is -69.3%, placing it at the 8.4th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (-77.0% to 14.3%). This indicates KO has underperformed the S&P 500 considerably over the measured period.  The alpha consistently shows as 0.0 in the provided data, indicating that KO's performance is largely explained by its beta (market exposure).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $64.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $63.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $62.07
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $62.69

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates a short-term upward momentum.  However, the longer-term (60-day) average is slightly lower, hinting at potential consolidation or minor resistance. The day-to-day change shows a positive jump of $1.94 from the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 62.26 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO:** 0.41 – A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +8.4% – Shows a recent period of outperformance compared to the S&P 500, albeit short-term.
* **Expected Return:** -252.5% – This extremely negative figure warrants significant concern.  It suggests that the model predicts a substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years).  This forecast should be treated with extreme caution, as such dramatic negative predictions are rarely accurate.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent.  There are two entries for 2024-10-24.  Assuming the duplicate is an error and one is ignored, the recent earnings show some fluctuation. Revenue shows some variation between quarters, though not particularly extreme. The EPS also varies from quarter to quarter, but this variation seems to be expected in the beverage industry. More consistent data is needed for comprehensive analysis.

| Date        | EPS     | Revenue       |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24  | $0.66   | $11.85B       |
| 2024-07-29  | $0.56   | $12.36B       |
| 2024-05-02  | $0.74   | $11.30B       |
| 2023-10-24  | $0.71   | $11.95B       |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, fluctuating around $11-12B. Profit margins are high and generally consistent, though showing a slight dip in Q4 2023.  Equity values are also relatively stable. ROE fluctuates but is generally positive, reflecting profitability.  The overall financial picture indicates a healthy and stable company, but performance relative to the market remains underwhelming.

**7. Summary:**

Coca-Cola (KO) exhibits strong financial fundamentals with consistent revenue and high profit margins. However, its stock performance significantly lags behind the S&P 500. While recent price action suggests some upward momentum and technical indicators are relatively neutral, the long-term projected return is alarmingly negative. The discrepancies between the company's strong financial health and its underperformance against the market require further investigation.  The predicted significantly negative return should be viewed with skepticism and requires further analysis of the model used to generate this prediction.  More data, particularly a longer historical perspective and a detailed breakdown of the -252.5% expected return calculation, is needed for a more informed investment decision.
