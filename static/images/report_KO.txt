**1. Return Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Coca-Cola Co (KO) is a global beverage company that manufactures, markets, and sells non-alcoholic beverages.
*   **KO Cumulative Return:** 48.08%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -52.8% (KO underperformed VOO by this amount).  Relative divergence: 9.9.  This means the current divergence is close to the lowest it has been in the observed period.

**Analysis:**  Coca-Cola has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The relative divergence indicates this underperformance is near its worst level within the observed range, suggesting persistent issues or missed opportunities relative to the broader market.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 18.0% | 0.0% | -11.0% | 0.0 | 197.4 |
| 2016-2018  | 10.0% | 71.9% | -5.0% | 0.1 | 203.8 |
| 2017-2019  | 24.0% | 71.9% | 2.0% | 0.4 | 238.2 |
| 2018-2020  | 18.0% | 81.4% | -5.0% | 0.4 | 236.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 28.0% | 81.4% | -19.0% | 0.6 | 254.8 |
| 2020-2022  | 3.0% | 81.4% | 3.0% | 0.7 | 273.8 |
| 2021-2023  | 6.0% | 79.7% | 4.0% | 0.5 | 253.6 |
| 2022-2024  | 0.0% | 79.7% | -21.0% | 0.5 | 267.9 |
| 2023-2025  | 16.0% | 79.6% | -49.0% | 0.2 | 301.5 |

**Analysis:**
*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Growth rates have fluctuated.  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a decent 16.0%, but the preceding period (2022-2024) was flat.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Drawdowns are quite high across the board.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is generally negative or low positive.  This indicates KO is not generating excess returns compared to its benchmark, often significantly underperforming (especially recently).
*   **Beta:**  Beta is low, suggesting KO is less volatile than the market (less sensitive to market movements).  A beta close to zero suggests little to no correlation with the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Cap in Billions):**  The market cap has generally increased over time, indicating overall company growth, even if stock performance hasn't mirrored it.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 70.06
*   **Last Day Change:** -0.43
*   **5-day SMA:** 70.486
*   **20-day SMA:** 70.964
*   **60-day SMA:** 69.4475

**Analysis:**  The stock price is below all short-term and mid-term moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, further supporting this downward momentum. However, the 60-day SMA being lower than both may indicate it is in an upward trend in the long term. The recent daily decline, while small, contributes to the negative sentiment.

**3. Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment).
*   **RSI:** 46.42 (Neutral - Neither overbought nor oversold).
*   **PPO:** -0.1797 (Slightly negative momentum).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Very Safe).
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -1.6 (Short-term decline).
*   **Expected Return:** -170.7%.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment rating suggests that there may be some potential risks but the stock is still considered to be relatively stable.
*   **RSI:** A neutral RSI value around 50 suggests that there isn't a particular tendency in buying or selling the stock.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO reinforces the short-term downward momentum indicated by the moving averages.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The buy signal is surprising given the other negative indicators. This may be based on longer-term factors or a different set of criteria in its algorithm.
*   **Divergence Change:** The short-term negative divergence change confirms the stock is currently underperforming its comparison.
*   **Expected Return:** The very negative expected return is extremely concerning and suggests that analysts believe the stock is significantly overvalued or facing severe headwinds. This contradicts the "Very Safe" hybrid signal.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Dividend Stock Considerations:** Several articles discuss whether Coca-Cola is a good dividend stock, likely due to its status as a Dividend King (long history of consecutive dividend increases).
*   **CEO Outlook:** Articles reference a new CEO and forecasts.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** Mentions analyst forecasts and targets, as well as a Viking Fund Management increasing their stake.
*   **Lawsuit Risk:** One article mentions a "Lawsuit Risk."
*   **Stock Split:** Potential for a stock split being discussed.

**Analysis:**

*   The news is mixed. Dividend stability is a key focus, which is generally positive. However, the mention of a "Lawsuit Risk" is a significant red flag that warrants further investigation. Discussions about a stock split are generally viewed as neutral to slightly positive, as they can increase liquidity and make the stock more accessible to smaller investors.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.62)
*   **Target Price (Avg/High/Low):** 79.61 / 87.00 / 72.00

**Analysis:**

*   Analysts generally have a positive outlook on Coca-Cola, with a consensus rating of "Buy." The average target price suggests an upside potential from the current price. However, there is a wide range of target prices, indicating uncertainty among analysts. The lack of recent rating changes suggests no strong recent shifts in analyst sentiment.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Coca-Cola presents a mixed picture:

*   **Underperformance:** It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and its alpha is consistently negative.
*   **Recent Downtrend:** Short-term momentum indicators (moving averages, PPO) suggest a current downtrend.
*   **Financial Strength:** The company has strong revenue, high profit margins, and increasing equity.
*   **Dividends:** It is a well-regarded dividend stock.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts are generally positive, with a consensus "Buy" rating.
*   **Risk Factors:** The extremely negative "Expected Return" and the mention of a lawsuit risk are serious concerns that contradict the positive overall view.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is not consistent with the overall negative indicators and expected return.

**Overall Recommendation:**

While Coca-Cola has financial strengths and analyst support, the significant underperformance relative to the market, the extremely negative "Expected Return," and the identified "Lawsuit Risk" suggest caution. More investigation is needed to understand the factors driving the low expected return and the nature/potential impact of the lawsuit. The hybrid signal may require further review as well.

**I would not recommend investing in Coca-Cola based solely on this data. A deeper dive into the potential risks and the reasons behind the negative long-term outlook is essential.**
