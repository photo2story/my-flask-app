**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 69.12
*   **Previous Close:** 69.91
*   **Change:** -1.13
*   **5-day SMA:** 69.826
*   **20-day SMA:** 70.119
*   **60-day SMA:** 69.972

**Analysis:** The stock price has decreased slightly recently.  The fact that the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs suggests a short-term downtrend. The negative change suggests a slight decline.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Hybrid Signal Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 50.09
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.16

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 2.7 (+) (단기상승 = Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -158.2

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI of around 50 indicates a neutral momentum. The negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a possible downtrend. The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, seeing it as very safe with a high MRI. The recent short-term increase in divergence is positive, but the extremely negative Expected Return is a major concern.  The sharp price decline suggested by `change: -1.13` reinforces the recent fluctuation.
