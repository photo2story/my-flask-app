## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Review

This report analyzes Coca-Cola Co (KO), a global beverage company producing and marketing non-alcoholic beverages.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

KO's cumulative return is 48.78%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's 120.73% cumulative return.  The difference is -71.9%, placing it at the 2.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max range).  This indicates KO's underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently shows a value of 0.0 indicating that KO's returns can be explained solely through its beta exposure to the market.  The beta itself fluctuates, but consistently reveals a relatively low level of systematic risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $62.60
* **5-day Moving Average:** $62.76
* **20-day Moving Average:** $62.88
* **60-day Moving Average:** $66.62

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.11 (Slightly above neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.20 (Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum)
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** +1.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests that the model expects no outperformance relative to the S&P500 for long-term (2+ years) investments.)


Given the closing price of $62.63 is close to the 5 and 20 day moving average but significantly below the 60-day moving average, there's no evidence of a sudden, dramatic price movement (either up or down) based solely on this data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates around $11-12B, showing no clear consistent upward trend over these few quarters.
* **EPS:** EPS also shows fluctuation, without a clear trend.  There is no context to evaluate whether these numbers beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, though profitability (profit margin) shows some fluctuation, decreasing in the last quarter of 2023 and showing subsequent increase.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable, with some quarterly fluctuations. ROE also varies, suggesting some variability in profitability and capital efficiency.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Therefore, no analysis can be performed on recent market outlook or current sentiment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

KO has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. While technical indicators suggest a modestly bullish short-term outlook, the price is below its moving averages, indicating a potential downward trend. Recent earnings show some fluctuation in both revenue and EPS, without a clear upward trend.  The financial information highlights some variability in profitability and capital efficiency.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinion prevents a more comprehensive assessment of the current market sentiment and outlook. The expected return of 0.0% suggests that even with a long-term horizon, significant outperformance compared to the broader market is not expected based on the current data.  Further analysis including competitor performance and broader economic factors is needed to form a complete investment recommendation.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the mixed technical indicators, and the inconsistent recent earnings, a cautious approach is warranted.  Further investigation is needed, including:

* Analysis of competitor performance in the beverage industry.
* Consideration of macroeconomic factors and their potential impact on KO's future performance.
* Examination of  analyst ratings and price targets.
* Assessing whether the 0.0% expected return adequately reflects future risks and opportunities for KO's stock.


This analysis is based solely on the limited data provided.  A thorough investment decision requires a more comprehensive analysis including external factors not covered in this report.
