The table shows variable CAGR and Alpha values across different periods, indicating fluctuating performance relative to the market (Beta also varies).  Negative Alpha values suggest underperformance against the benchmark in certain years.  The consistently high maximum drawdown (MDD) highlights the potential for significant price drops.

* **Closing Price:** $71.68
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.64
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $68.33

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting minor recent downward pressure. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend in the medium to long term.  The recent price decrease (-$0.25) is minor and doesn't suggest a significant downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 53.38 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.098 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **Expected Return (long-term):** -4.1% (Negative expected return relative to the S&P 500)

The indicators paint a mixed picture. While the PPO and relative divergence suggest bullish momentum, the negative expected return and medium risk level caution against excessive optimism.  The RSI is close to neutral, leaving room for movement in either direction.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

KO has shown a slightly better performance than the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, but  the predicted long-term return is negative compared to the index. While recent price action and some technical indicators point towards a potential upward trend, the mixed signals from other indicators and the relatively high MDD in historical data suggest caution.  The company's financial performance is generally strong, with stable revenue and high profit margins. Further investigation into the reasons for EPS variability and the duplicate earnings data entry is needed. Before making any investment decisions, investors should carefully consider the risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence.  The -4.1% expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests that, while KO may outperform in the short-term, investors should consider its performance in the context of broader market movements and the potential for lower returns compared to a diversified market index.
