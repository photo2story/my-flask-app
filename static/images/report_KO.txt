Okay, here's a breakdown of the data provided for Coca-Cola (KO), including analysis of each section and a comprehensive summary.

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Coca-Cola Co is a global beverage company known for its iconic soft drinks and diverse portfolio of other beverages.

*   **Cumulative Return:** KO (40.18%) vs. VOO (S&P 500) (91.00%).

*   **Divergence:** -50.8 (current divergence).  This is significantly below the S&P 500.  Relative divergence of 7.4 indicates this divergence is near the lower end of its historical range.

*   **Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD:**

    | Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
    |------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
    | 2016-2018  | 9.0% | 7.3% | 5.0% | 0.5 | 203.8 |
    | 2017-2019  | 23.0% | 10.2% | 6.0% | 0.4 | 238.2 |
    | 2018-2020  | 17.0% | 10.3% | -4.0% | 0.7 | 236.0 |
    | 2019-2021  | 26.0% | 10.3% | -17.0% | 0.7 | 254.8 |
    | 2020-2022  | 2.0% | 15.7% | 4.0% | 0.7 | 273.8 |
    | 2021-2023  | 5.0% | 15.7% | 4.0% | 0.5 | 253.6 |
    | 2022-2024  | 0.0% | 15.7% | -20.0% | 0.4 | 267.9 |
    | 2023-2025  | 15.0% | 13.8% | -47.0% | 0.1 | 300.9 |

    *   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate fluctuates significantly.  Higher CAGR periods were between 2017-2021. More recent periods (2020-2024) show significantly lower growth.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. MDD is relatively low in earlier periods, but has increased recently.
    *   **Alpha:** This measures the investment's performance relative to a benchmark index (likely the S&P 500).  Periods with positive Alpha outperformed the benchmark, while negative Alpha means underperformance.  The trend is concerning, with Alpha becoming increasingly negative in more recent years (especially 2023-2025).
    *   **Beta:**  This measures volatility relative to the market. A Beta of 1 indicates volatility equal to the market.  A Beta less than 1 indicates lower volatility than the market (KO generally has a beta < 1). The beta for 2023-2025 is only 0.1, which may explain the substantial negative alpha compared to S\&P 500.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in billions of dollars. This has shown a generally increasing trend.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 69.12
*   **Last Market:** Price: 69.12, Previous Close: 69.91, Change: -1.13
*   **5-day SMA:** 69.826
*   **20-day SMA:** 70.119
*   **60-day SMA:** 69.972

*   **Analysis:**  The current price is slightly below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend. The recent change (-1.13) confirms this short term downward trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment).
*   **RSI:** 50.09 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold).
*   **PPO:** -0.1587 (Slightly negative - could indicate minor downward momentum).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (31 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_0.51 Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.6 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -215.2. Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.  The RSI being near 50 implies neutral momentum. The Hybrid Signal recommends buying. However, the expected return is significantly negative, suggesting caution. The positive recent divergence change contrasts sharply with the negative expected return.

    *   **Equity & ROE:** Equity has shown a steady increase, which is a positive sign. The Return on Equity (ROE) is also robust. ROE indicates how efficiently a company generates profits from shareholders' equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** KO has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative return. The negative Alpha values in recent periods confirm this.
*   **Recent Momentum:** Short-term indicators are mixed. The stock price is slightly below its moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The RSI is neutral. The Hybrid Signal suggests a buy.
*   **News Sentiment:** The news is mixed, with some articles highlighting potential upside and passive income opportunities, while others focus on stock declines and layoffs.
*   **Analyst Opinion:** Analysts are generally positive on KO, with a "Buy" rating and a significant upside potential based on target prices.
*   **Strong Fundamentals:**  KO demonstrates strong financial fundamentals with increasing revenue, high profit margins, increasing equity, and healthy ROE.
*   **Key Concern:** Despite the solid financials, analyst ratings, and recent increase of stake by Gateway, the long-term expected return compared to the S\&P 500 is substantially negative. This may be caused by beta value (0.1) for 2023-2025.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data presents a mixed picture. While Coca-Cola exhibits strong financial health and analysts are optimistic, the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and a very negative expected return compared to the S\&P 500 is a significant concern.

A potential investment strategy might involve a small, diversified position, while monitoring the stock's performance and the evolving news landscape. Consider a "hold" or "cautious buy" approach, closely watching for improvements in relative performance and market sentiment.
