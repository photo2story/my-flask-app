* **5-day Moving Average:** $70.60
* **20-day Moving Average:** $70.26
* **60-day Moving Average:** $68.01

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend.  The recent price change of $1.43 (from $71.43) indicates a noticeable positive movement.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk category) suggesting caution.
* **RSI:** 62.07 (Slightly above neutral, not overbought)

* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** -17.1% (Short-term bearish divergence).

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola shows strong fundamentals with consistently high profit margins and a large market capitalization.  However, recent performance has lagged the S&P 500, and several indicators suggest caution. While the recent price jump is positive, the negative expected return and high market risk indicator warrant further investigation.  A deeper dive into industry comparisons, future growth projections, and qualitative factors (e.g., brand strength, competitive landscape) is necessary for a complete investment decision.  The provided data suggests a potentially volatile but fundamentally sound company.  Long-term investors should carefully monitor the market environment and consider the potential for both upward and downward price movements.  The -9.4% expected return should be treated with skepticism given recent price movements and the need for more comprehensive analysis.
