**6) Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola (KO) shows a strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, with generally positive alpha and consistent profitability. Recent price action suggests a slight short-term downtrend, but the longer-term trend appears positive.  Technical indicators are mostly neutral to bullish.  However, some volatility in earnings and financial metrics warrants further investigation.  The -4% expected return needs further explanation.  A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) in KO could potentially yield higher returns than VOO based on historical data, but this is not a guarantee.  Thorough due diligence is crucial before making any investment decisions.
