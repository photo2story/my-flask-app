## Coca-Cola Co. (KO) Stock Review

This report analyzes Coca-Cola Co. (KO) stock performance, financial health, and recent news, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Coca-Cola Co. is a multinational beverage corporation and manufacturer, marketer, and distributor of non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups.

The cumulative return of KO is 56.32%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 130.06%.  The difference is -73.7%, placing it at the 2.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates KO significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.  The provided CAGR data shows variable performance over different periods, ranging from 5% to 35%, highlighting the volatility of its returns relative to a more diversified index like the S&P 500. The consistently low Alpha values suggest that KOâ€™s performance wasn't significantly different from the market as a whole after accounting for systematic risk (Beta).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $64.08
* **5-day Moving Average:** $63.88
* **20-day Moving Average:** $63.20
* **60-day Moving Average:** $67.37

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The last market price of $63.74 is near the 20-day moving average but significantly below the 60-day average, indicating a potential for further decline or consolidation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 56.16 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.65 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:**  `nan` (No data provided. Missing data prevents conclusive analysis)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests that at current valuation and given the historical data compared to the S&P 500, there is no expected excess return over the long-term investment in KO, relative to the S&P 500 index)

The lack of data for the relative divergence and the low expectation return suggest caution. The relatively low RSI despite the positive PPO could indicate a potential for a price correction. The provided closing price of $63.74 doesn't show a significant recent rapid upward or downward movement.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-10-24).  Focusing only on the unique entries:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates between $11.30B and $12.36B. No clear upward or downward trend is evident from this limited data.
* **EPS:** Also fluctuates, ranging from $0.56 to $0.74. There's no clear trend identifiable from just these few data points.  Comparing the quarterly EPS is difficult without knowing the expectations.

More data is needed for a robust analysis of revenue growth trends and EPS changes.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuation but no strong trend. Profit margins are generally high (above 57%), although they have slightly decreased in recent quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity fluctuates around $26B. ROE is variable, ranging from 7.61% to 12.02%, indicating some variability in profitability.

A more comprehensive analysis would require data spanning multiple years to identify long-term trends.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook or analyst opinions are provided.  This section requires additional information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

KO's performance has significantly lagged behind the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.  While some technical indicators suggest bullish momentum, the lack of clear trends in earnings, and the negative performance relative to the market raise concerns.  The high profit margins are a positive, but the inconsistent ROE and lack of clear revenue growth trends warrant caution.  Further investigation, including analyst ratings and news, is recommended before making any investment decisions. The extremely low expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises concerns about long-term outperformance.  More data on the market outlook and recent news are required to have a more complete picture.
