**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $61.53
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $61.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $62.91

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change of -$0.40 indicates a minor negative movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.25 (Slightly below neutral; leaning towards oversold territory)
* **PPO:** 0.14 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum but weak)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -4.7% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** -2393.1% (This extremely negative value requires investigation; it is likely an error in the data or calculation.  The negative sign suggests significantly underperforming the S&P500 over the long term (2+ years), but the magnitude is unrealistic.)

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistencies and likely duplicates.  Revenue fluctuates, and EPS is not consistently increasing.  More consistent and accurate data is needed for thorough analysis.

| 2024-10-24 | 0.66 | $11.85B       |
| 2024-07-29 | 0.56 | $12.36B       |

| 2024-10-24 | 0.71 | $11.95B       | *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has been relatively stable, though profitability (profit margin) shows some fluctuation. ROE (Return on Equity) also shows variability, indicating fluctuating profitability.  More detailed analysis would require further financial statements.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $11.85B | 60.65% |

| 2024-06-30 | $25.85B   | 9.33%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $26.43B   | 12.02% |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

KO has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While some quarters show strong profitability, the inconsistent earnings data and the unusually low Beta value raise concerns. The negative expected return value needs clarification.  Further investigation into the data sources and calculations is crucial.  Technical indicators suggest a possible bearish trend in the short term.  A more in-depth analysis considering macroeconomic factors, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is needed before making any investment decisions.  The provided -2393.1% expected return is highly improbable and needs immediate review.
