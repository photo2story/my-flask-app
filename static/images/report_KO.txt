**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $63.36
* **Last Market Price:** $63.80 (Slight increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $63.20

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** 0.21 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -326.6% (This significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and requires further investigation of the calculation methodology).  The last market price shows a slight upward movement, but this needs to be considered in the context of a longer-term downtrend.

The indicators present a mixed signal. While momentum is positive (PPO), the recent relative divergence shows a short-term bearish trend.  The extremely negative expected return needs clarification.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, indicating underperformance.  While some short-term indicators suggest a potential upward trend, the long-term outlook based on the provided (and concerningly negative) expected return is unclear.  Further investigation is required to understand the reasons for the significant underperformance against the market, particularly the extremely negative expected return estimate. A thorough review of the methodology used to calculate the expected return is crucial.  The provided financial information shows a generally healthy company with stable revenue and high profit margins, but inconsistencies in EPS and ROE warrant further analysis.  Before making any investment decision, a deeper dive into the underlying factors driving the company's performance and the methodology of the expected return calculation is strongly recommended.
