The provided data shows varying CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta, and Market Capitalization (Cap) over different periods.  The alpha consistently remains positive (except for 2022-2024), suggesting KO has outperformed the market (though the magnitude is small).

**6) Overall Analysis:**

KO has shown relatively strong cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500, although the recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn.  While the high profit margins and generally healthy financial metrics are positive indicators, the mixed signals from earnings data, technical indicators (RSI and PPO), and a projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 warrant further investigation before making any investment decisions. The provided Alpha and Beta values are inconsistent and need clarification.  Further analysis should include a thorough review of the inconsistent Alpha and Beta values, a comparison of earnings data to historical trends, and an examination of broader macroeconomic factors that may impact KO's performance.
