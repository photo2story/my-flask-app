## Coca-Cola Co (KO) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Coca-Cola Co (KO) is a beverage company producing and distributing non-alcoholic beverages worldwide.

The provided data shows KO's cumulative return at 47.96% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 120.36%.  This represents a significant underperformance of KO relative to the market. The difference in cumulative returns is -72.4%, placing it at the 2.3rd percentile of its historical range of divergence (-74.4% to 14.3%).

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows varying performance over different time periods, ranging from a high of 33% to a low of -3%.  Importantly, the Alpha consistently remains at 0, indicating that KO's returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta is not consistently provided, so a definitive statement can't be made about it's consistency relative to market risk).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $62.42
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $62.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $63.09

The price is slightly below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend, though it's important to note the differences are relatively small.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 49.75 – This indicates a relatively neutral market sentiment, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.27 – A positive value suggests a bullish momentum, albeit a weak one.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -6.8% –  Indicates a recent short-term price decline.
* **Expected Return:** -1003.2% – This extremely negative figure for long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is likely an error in the data provided.  It needs clarification.  A negative expected return would suggest the model predicts KO will significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term. The provided daily price change (-0.46%) is minimal and doesn't signal a dramatic shift.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicates.  A clearer presentation is needed for meaningful analysis.  However, based on the available data, revenue fluctuates slightly quarter-over-quarter, and EPS shows some volatility.  A more complete and accurate data set is required for a proper assessment of earnings trends.

**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability, and Capital and Profitability tables show some volatility across quarters. Revenue is generally stable, while Profit Margin shows fluctuations between 57% and 62%. Similarly, Equity and ROE fluctuate, suggesting some seasonality or other factors impacting profitability and capital structure. More analysis would require a longer time horizon and additional contextual information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coca-Cola's recent performance lags significantly behind the S&P 500. While technical indicators paint a mixed picture, the substantial underperformance and the highly improbable negative long-term expected return (assuming this is an error in the data provided) raise concerns.  Revenue and profitability are relatively stable but fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.  More thorough and consistent data, including clarification on the negative expected return and the duplicate earnings data, is critical for a comprehensive assessment. Further analysis should consider macroeconomic factors, competitive pressures, and Coca-Cola's long-term strategic plans.
