KO's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, with a negative expected return relative to the market over the long term.

Investors should carefully consider the risks associated with the relatively high valuation and the potential for short-term correction before investing.  Further fundamental analysis is needed to assess the long-term viability and growth potential of Coca-Cola.  The long-term outlook (-20.3% expected underperformance) necessitates caution and suggests careful consideration of the investment's role within a diversified portfolio.
