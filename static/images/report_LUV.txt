* **Expected Return:** -8831.3% (This extremely negative figure needs clarification. It's likely an error or a misinterpretation of the data provided.  It does not accurately reflect realistic expectations. The actual expected return should be modeled based on factors beyond the scope of this brief analysis).

The small price increase reflected in the "Last-market" data doesn't indicate a significant reversal of the overall bearish trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Southwest Airlines currently shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, characterized by high volatility and inconsistent profitability.  While some oversold conditions are indicated by the RSI, the negative PPO and overall downward price trend suggest caution.  The large negative "expected return" value is almost certainly an error and should be disregarded.  Further in-depth analysis is necessary to understand the factors driving the company's performance and to assess its long-term prospects.  A thorough review of macroeconomic factors affecting the airline industry and a detailed competitive analysis are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high beta implies a high level of risk associated with investing in LUV.
