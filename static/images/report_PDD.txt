PDD Holdings Inc ADR is a leading e-commerce company in China.  The cumulative return of PDD is 92.13%, exceeding the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 90.95% by 1.18 percentage points.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, is 13.8% (based on a scale where the maximum outperformance was 467.8% and minimum was -73.6%).

This highlights the volatility inherent in the stock.

The high alpha values in some years (especially 2018-2020) indicate significant outperformance, while other periods show significant underperformance, suggesting considerable risk.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 48.32.  This indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral short-term outlook.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.69. A positive value suggests a bullish trend, but the magnitude is relatively small.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -4.0%.  Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 564.1%.  This projects a significant long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500,  but it is crucial to acknowledge that this is a prediction, not a guarantee.  The high expected return reflects the inherent volatility and potential for both significant gains and losses.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PDD shows a strong track record of exceeding earnings expectations, and demonstrates consistent profitability.

The high expected return should be viewed with caution, acknowledging the risk associated with this level of projected growth.
