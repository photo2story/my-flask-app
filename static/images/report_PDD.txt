## PDD Holdings Inc ADR (PDD) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PDD Holdings Inc ADR is a Chinese e-commerce company operating a leading online retail platform.

The cumulative return of PDD is 91.92%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) returned 85.60%.  This represents a difference of **6.32%** in favor of PDD as of the last data point. The relative divergence of 14.8% indicates PDD's performance is in the upper portion of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  However, the significant swings in the maximum and minimum divergence (467.7% and -73.7%) highlight the volatility associated with this stock.

The provided CAGR data shows highly variable performance year-over-year, ranging from a massive 456% gain to a significant -197% loss.  This underscores the inherent risk in investing in PDD.  The consistently high beta (around 139) reinforces the stock's high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  While the alpha is consistently around 0.1, indicating slight outperformance relative to the market (given the beta), it's crucial to interpret this in the context of the substantial risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $100.08
* **Last Market Price:** $100.22
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $97.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $98.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $107.64

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting potential short-term upward momentum. However, it's significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a recent downtrend.  The relatively small gap between the closing and last market price doesn't suggest any significant intraday volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.75 – This indicates the stock is trading near neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO:** 0.68 – A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, although the magnitude is relatively modest.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.2 – This indicates a recent weakening of relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 288.1% – This represents a substantial projected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon (2+ years).  This high expectation should be viewed with caution due to the high volatility observed in PDD's historical data.  The accuracy depends greatly on the model used for the projection and the assumptions it makes about future market conditions and company performance.  Significant risk exists.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.  This positive trend is encouraging, but past performance is not a guarantee of future results.  It's crucial to analyze the drivers behind these earnings beats and assess their sustainability.

**7. Overall Analysis:**
