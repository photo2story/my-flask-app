The high CAGR in earlier periods showcases significant growth. However, the negative CAGR in 2021-2023 and the fluctuating beta highlight considerable volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The alpha, especially the exceptionally high values in earlier periods, suggests significant outperformance relative to the market.  However, it's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.
