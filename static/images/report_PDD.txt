## PDD Holdings Inc ADR (PDD) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PDD Holdings Inc ADR is a Chinese e-commerce company.  As of the last data point, PDD's cumulative return (92.13%) exceeded the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (90.95%) by 1.18 percentage points.  The relative divergence suggests PDD's performance is in the upper 13.8th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals significant volatility in PDD's performance over different periods. While exhibiting high CAGR in some periods (e.g., 456% in 2018-2020), it also experienced substantial negative returns (-194% in 2021-2023). The consistent beta around 0.1 suggests low correlation with the overall market.  Note that the high Alpha values in some periods should be viewed cautiously given the significant volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $99.61
* **Last Market Price:** $102.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $102.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $103.54
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $119.72

The stock is currently trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a downward trend.  The difference between the last market price and the closing price might reflect after-hours trading activity.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.32 (slightly below neutral; not oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.6871 (positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.0% (indicates a recent short-term downward trend)

The expected return of 564.1% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant projection and requires careful consideration.  This likely reflects the potential for high growth but also the inherent risk associated with such high growth projections, especially given PDD's historical volatility. The $102.49 last market price doesn't indicate a sharp price movement (either up or down) based on the provided data.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

PDD has consistently exceeded its EPS expectations in the provided data.  While there is a downward trend in EPS growth, the company has still outperformed expectations each quarter.  The data does not provide revenue growth figures, therefore trend analysis can not be performed.  Key observations:


* **Consistent EPS Beats:**  Actual EPS consistently surpassed estimated EPS in every quarter shown.
* **EPS Growth Trend:** While EPS is increasing, the growth rate seems to be slowing.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Shows a mixed trend, with revenue increasing in some quarters and decreasing in others, potentially linked to seasonal factors or company-specific strategies.  No clear revenue trend emerges from this limited dataset.
* **Profit Margins:**  The profit margin remains strong, mostly hovering around 60%, demonstrating consistent profitability.  Slight fluctuations could reflect operational efficiency adjustments or changing market dynamics.
* **Equity and ROE:** Both equity and Return on Equity (ROE) show a growth trend, suggesting improved financial health and efficiency.  However, ROE displays some volatility, particularly between Q2 2024 and Q3 2024.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PDD demonstrates strong growth potential but also considerable volatility. While the recent earnings consistently beat expectations and the financial position appears healthy, the significant price movement and high projected long-term return warrant caution.  The stock's current price is below its moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, the positive PPO and the historical outperformance versus the S&P 500 suggest long-term potential.  A thorough understanding of the geopolitical risks associated with Chinese companies and a comprehensive review of recent news and analyst sentiment are crucial before making any investment decisions.  More information, especially on revenue growth trends and recent news, is needed for a more complete assessment.
