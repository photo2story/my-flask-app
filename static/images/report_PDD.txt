This report analyzes PDD Holdings Inc ADR (PDD), a leading Chinese e-commerce company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

PDD Holdings Inc ADR is a Chinese e-commerce company operating in the global market.  The cumulative return for PDD is 162.85%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 90.76%. The difference is 72.09%, placing it at the 22.65th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a range of 545.02% to -66.43%).  While this outperformance is notable, the relative percentile indicates this level of outperformance is not exceptionally unusual historically.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows significant variations across different time periods. While alpha (excess return relative to the market) has generally been positive indicating outperformance, its volatility highlights the risk involved. High beta values in certain periods (e.g., 2021-2023) suggest higher sensitivity to market movements.  Market capitalization has also fluctuated considerably, reflecting the company's growth and market sentiment changes.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $117.31
* **5-day Moving Average:** $114.17
* **20-day Moving Average:** $120.22
* **60-day Moving Average:** $117.46

The price is slightly below the 60-day moving average and significantly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend.  The 5-day moving average being below the current price indicates some recent upward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **PPO (-0.59):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence (-3.24):**  Indicates a recent weakening in the stock's relative strength.

The combination of these indicators suggests mixed signals. While the RSI suggests a potential upward move, the PPO and negative divergence point to continued bearish pressure. The closing price of $117.32 is not significantly different from the last market price, thus suggesting no dramatic change.

**Expected Return (22.41%):** This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.  However, this forecast should be interpreted cautiously, as it's based on historical data and future performance is never guaranteed.
