* **Closing Price:** $100.07
* **5-day Moving Average:** $111.13
* **20-day Moving Average:** $117.41
* **60-day Moving Average:** $118.46

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 24.45 (Oversold territory)

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 9.55% (Excess return over S&P 500 for long-term investors)

The low RSI suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. However, the negative PPO and recent price decline temper this optimism.  The current price of $100.07, being below the moving averages, does not suggest a sudden sharp rebound. The 9.55% expected return is a positive indicator for long-term investors.
