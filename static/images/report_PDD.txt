## PDD Holdings Inc ADR (PDD) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

PDD Holdings Inc ADR is a Chinese e-commerce company operating in the consumer-to-consumer (C2C) and business-to-consumer (B2C) sectors.  Its cumulative return of 101.53% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 89.57% over the analyzed period. The difference is 12.0%, placing it in the 84.2nd percentile (15.8 on a 0-100 scale) based on historical data.  This indicates a relatively strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this is not a guarantee of future performance.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha and beta values fluctuate significantly across different time periods, suggesting high volatility and market sensitivity.  High alpha values in certain periods indicate outperformance, while negative alphas show underperformance relative to the benchmark. The Beta values generally remain around 0.1 indicating a low correlation to overall market movements but this may not be consistent in the long run.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $104.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $102.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $105.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $119.50

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The 5-day average is closer to the current price, hinting at recent price stabilization, at least in the short term.  The last market price of $103.34 indicates a minor decline compared to the closing price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (34.67):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce back but not confirming it.
* **PPO (0.77):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, however, the significance should be viewed in context with other indicators.
* **Relative Strength Change (2.2+):** Shows a recent increase in relative strength, indicating a short-term uptrend.  This is minor in comparison to the broader picture.

The expected return of 497.2% over a long-term (2+ years) horizon is extremely high and should be viewed with significant skepticism.  While the past performance has been strong,  projecting such a high return is unrealistic and highly dependent on continued exceptional growth that may not be sustainable. The number must be viewed cautiously.  It should be remembered that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has shown relatively consistent growth, but profit margins have fluctuated, peaking in Q2 2024. Equity and ROE have both shown strong growth, suggesting financial health and profitability.  The ROE is particularly noteworthy, and shows the efficiency of the company to convert investments into profits.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the past two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This data is not provided and therefore cannot be analyzed.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PDD has shown strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent earnings have consistently exceeded expectations, indicating positive financial health. However, technical indicators suggest potential short-term volatility and a possible downward trend. The company's high ROE suggests good management of resources.   The extremely high projected return should be treated with caution.  Further analysis is required to assess the long-term sustainability of the growth trajectory. Key missing data, such as revenue growth trends, recent news, and analyst opinions, would significantly improve the accuracy and completeness of this analysis.
