**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

PDD's cumulative return (94.81%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (83.45%) by 11.36 percentage points.  The relative divergence metric (15.7) indicates that PDD's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this is only a snapshot and the historical volatility (max 467.8%, min -73.6%)  indicates significant periods of both outperformance and underperformance.  The CAGR analysis shows significant volatility in performance across different periods, ranging from massive gains to substantial losses.  This volatility needs to be considered.

* **Expected Return:** 492.5% (long-term, 2+ years, vs. S&P 500) This exceptionally high projected return needs to be treated with extreme caution.
