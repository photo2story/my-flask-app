This inconsistency needs further investigation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PDD exhibits strong long-term growth potential, evidenced by its significant outperformance of the S&P 500 and generally high profitability and ROE. However, its high volatility, as reflected in the significant swings in CAGR and the occasional misses in earnings expectations, presents considerable risk.  The recent price action suggests a possible consolidation phase after a period of strong growth.  The high expected return over a long-term investment horizon makes it attractive to long-term investors with a high-risk tolerance.
