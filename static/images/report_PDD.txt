## PDD Holdings Inc ADR (PDD) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

PDD Holdings Inc ADR is a Chinese e-commerce company operating Pinduoduo, a mobile-based shopping platform.

The cumulative return of PDD is 102.43%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 87.54%.  The difference is 14.9%, placing it in the 16.4th percentile of its historical range of outperformance against the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -73.7% and a maximum of 467.7%).  While significantly better than the S&P 500 recently, historical volatility highlights the risk involved.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows highly variable CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), MDD (Maximum Drawdown), Alpha, and Beta across different periods.  The significant negative CAGR in 2021-2023 (-197%) demonstrates substantial risk. While Alpha is consistently around 0.1, suggesting slight outperformance relative to the market, the high Beta (around 147) signifies extreme volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The high beta indicates a much higher risk profile than the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $105.57
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $100.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $98.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $107.32

The price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential resistance level.  The recent price change of +5.3% reflects a sharp upward move.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 61.65 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but approaching overbought territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 1.08 – A positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.8 – Shows a positive short-term relative divergence, supporting upward trend confirmation.

The significant price increase of 5.3% from the previous close should be considered. While this suggests a potential short-term upswing, it also means the risk of correction is heightened.

The expected return of 254% over the long term (2+ years) versus the S&P 500 is exceptionally high and should be viewed with caution.  This high projection needs further justification and consideration of the inherent volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.  This positive trend suggests strong earnings performance and potential for future growth.  However, it's crucial to analyze the factors contributing to this beat and assess the sustainability of such performance.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has been relatively stable, with minor fluctuations, exhibiting strong and consistent high profit margins exceeding 60% consistently in the last five quarters. This reflects a healthy and profitable business model.

**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity is increasing, showing a growth in the company's capital base. ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates but generally remains robust, indicating efficient use of shareholder capital.  However, the recent decline in ROE should be investigated further.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PDD exhibits strong revenue and profit margins, consistently exceeding earnings expectations.  However, the stock is exceptionally volatile (high Beta), demonstrating periods of extreme gains and losses.  The significant outperformance against the S&P 500 is notable, but historical data reveals substantial risk.  The recent price surge should be viewed cautiously, given the potential for a correction. While long-term growth potential exists, substantial risk should be considered due to the high volatility and the company's sensitivity to market swings.  Further due diligence, including analyzing macroeconomic factors affecting the Chinese e-commerce market and the company's competitive landscape, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The projected long-term return should be treated as a high-level estimate and requires comprehensive analysis to assess its plausibility.
