**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PDD's cumulative return (124.25%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (93.56%) by 30.69 percentage points.  The relative outperformance places it at the 15.88th percentile of its historical range (max: 545.02%, min: -66.43%), indicating a relatively strong performance compared to its historical volatility.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $111.13
* **20-day Moving Average:** $117.41
* **60-day Moving Average:** $118.46

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **PPO (-1.27):**  Shows a bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (-9.42):**  Points towards a recent price decline.
* **Expected Return (8.93%):**  Suggests a potential outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if the current price of $100.07 holds.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

PDD has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 historically, but the recent price action suggests a potential downward trend.  While technical indicators suggest the possibility of a short-term bounce due to oversold conditions,  the negative PPO and recent relative divergence indicate a bearish momentum.  The company's earnings have shown variability and the recent financial data reveals fluctuation in profit margins and ROE which need further investigation.  The long-term outlook (2+ years) is positive according to the provided expected return, but this is conditional on a change of current market trend reflected in price movements.  A thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions.
