* **20-day Moving Average:** $99.95
* **60-day Moving Average:** $106.12

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.  However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential near-term resistance level.  The recent price increase of $7.05 (from $104.01) shows a significant jump, indicating a possible period of rapid price appreciation.

* **RSI:** 72.35 (Approaching overbought territory)
