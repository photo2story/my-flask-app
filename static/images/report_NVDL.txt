## NVDL Analysis (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF)

NVDL, a leveraged ETF aiming for 2x the *daily* performance of NVIDIA, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 199.42% vs. VOO's 65.30%.  However, its high volatility and leveraged nature make it a very risky investment. Recent news highlights the inherent risks of leveraged ETFs. The ETF's Market Risk Indicator suggests caution and recent price action shows some volatility.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

*   **Ticker:** NVDL
*   **Company:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (Aims to provide 2x the *daily* return of NVIDIA stock)
*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 199.42%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 65.30%
*   **Absolute Divergence (Current):** 129.7
*   **Relative Divergence (Current):** 30.3 (Indicates NVDL's outperformance is in the lower range of its historical divergence from VOO).

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| 2022-2024  | 225.0%   | 76.2% | 181.0%  | 0.1 | 0.0   |
| 2023-2025  | 169.0%   | 80.7% | 108.0%  | 0.1 | 0.0   |

**Analysis:**

*   **High Growth, High Risk:** The CAGR figures are very impressive, indicating substantial growth potential. However, the massive MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures (76.2% and 80.7%) highlight the extreme risk associated with this ETF. Be prepared for significant drops in value.
*   **Alpha:** Positive alpha values indicate that NVDL has outperformed its benchmark (likely NVIDIA stock itself, given the ETF's objective) on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Very low Beta values suggest that the ETF has a very low correlation with the market and doesn't move in line with broad market movements.

**2) Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 89.23999786376953
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 89.24, 'previousClose': 87.94, 'change': 1.48} (A positive change from the previous close)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 88.864
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 90.4763
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 87.5736

**Analysis:**

*   The price is above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages but below the 20-day moving average. This mixed signal suggests a period of consolidation or potential short-term downward pressure. The small positive change in last Market data indicates that the price is bouncing back.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5 (Low Investment - approaching Very Risky territory)
*   **RSI:** 47.25 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.83 (Slightly negative, suggesting slight downward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_80%_Sell 0.4% of holdings (1 shares - Risky - MRI:0.50) (Cash Ratio: 80% on 2025-10-17) - Indicates a risk-off strategy is recommended.
*   **Recent (20-Day) Relative Divergence Change:** -3.9 (Indicates a recent underperformance relative to VOO)
*   **Expected Return:** 210.9% (This is a highly optimistic estimate of long-term outperformance vs. S&P 500, *if* the underlying assumptions hold true, and ignores the risk of ruin from a leveraged ETF.)

**Analysis:**

*   **Caution Advised:** The MRI score of 0.5 indicates that investing in this ETF is risky. The hybrid signal reinforces the need for caution.
*   **Divergence Decline:** The negative change in relative divergence suggests a recent weakening of NVDL's performance compared to VOO.
*   **High Expected Return, High Risk:** The extremely high expected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism due to the leveraged nature of the ETF.

**5) Overall Analysis & Recommendation:**

NVDL offers the *potential* for very high returns due to its leveraged exposure to NVIDIA. However, this comes with *extreme* risk. The ETF's historical volatility, the significant drawdowns it has experienced, and the warnings in recent news articles all suggest a very cautious approach.

*   **Key Concerns:**
    *   **Leverage:** The 2x leverage amplifies both gains *and losses*. A significant drop in NVIDIA's stock could lead to catastrophic losses for NVDL investors.
    *   **Daily Reset:** Leveraged ETFs reset *daily*. This means their long-term performance can deviate significantly from 2x the performance of the underlying asset due to the effects of compounding (volatility drag).
    *   **High Volatility:** The MDD figures demonstrate the potential for massive losses.
    *   **Market Risk Indicator:** The MRI score indicates high risk.
    *   **Recent News:** The Barron's article specifically advises against leveraged ETFs.

*   **Recommendation:** **This ETF is only suitable for sophisticated investors with a high-risk tolerance and a very short-term trading horizon.** It is *not* appropriate for long-term investment or for investors seeking stable returns. If you choose to invest in NVDL, do so with a very small portion of your portfolio and be prepared to lose your entire investment. Closely monitor NVIDIA's performance and be aware of market conditions. Consider the Hybrid Signal's suggestion to reduce holdings.
