2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down the provided data for NVDL and analyze its performance, risks, and potential.

**0. Report Outline:**

*   **Simple Numbers First:**  We'll present the raw figures.
*   **Simple Analysis:**  We'll provide straightforward interpretations.

**1. Return Rate Comparison (NVDL vs. VOO):**

*   **Ticker:** NVDL (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF)
*   **Company Overview:**  This ETF seeks to deliver *twice* the daily performance of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock.  It's a leveraged ETF, meaning it amplifies both gains and losses.
*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 167.27%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 65.32%
*   **Divergence:** 102.0 (Relative Divergence: 23.7)

**Analysis of Return Rate Comparison:**

*   NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the tracked period.  The cumulative return is more than double. This is expected due to the 2x leverage tied to the performance of Nvidia.
*   **Divergence Explanation:** The divergence of 102.0 with a relative divergence of 23.7 suggests that while NVDL's outperformance is substantial, it's not at the extreme upper end of its historical divergence range compared to VOO.  It's important to remember relative divergence shows where it is in its recent price history compared to its min/max range.
*   **Caveat:**  Leveraged ETFs are *not* designed for long-term buy-and-hold strategies.  Daily compounding effects can erode returns over time, especially in volatile markets. This is crucial to understand!

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2023-2025  | 135.0%  | 65.4% | 73.0%   | 4.0   | 0.0    |

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** A very high 135% average annual return between 2023 and 2025. This confirms the strong recent performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** A significant 65.4% drawdown.  This highlights the substantial risk associated with this leveraged ETF.  Investors could lose a large portion of their investment.
*   **Alpha:** 73.0%  This indicates that NVDL has generated excess returns above what would be expected based on its beta (its relationship to the market). This "extra" return is likely due to specific positive developments for NVIDIA and the ETF's leverage.
*   **Beta:** 4.0  This is extremely high.  It means NVDL is *four times* as volatile as the overall market (S&P 500). For every 1% move in the S&P 500, NVDL tends to move 4%.
*   **Cap(B):** 0.0. There is no specific meaning with the data provided.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 90.03
*   **Last Market Session:** Price: 90.03, Previous Close: 88.01, Change: 2.3%
*   **5-day SMA:** 89.77
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.35
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.20

**Analysis of Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   The price is above both its 5-day and 20-day simple moving averages, but is slightly below 60-day SMA, suggesting a short-term uptrend.
*   The 2.3% increase in the last market session signifies positive momentum.

**3. RSI, PPO, MRI, Hybrid Signal, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.08
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.29
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 90% of cash (10 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 2.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.6 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 342.1%

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.8 suggests a moderate level of risk and advises medium investment.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 58.08 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO (1.29) suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which typically indicates an upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The system is recommending to buy 90% of cash with 10 shares. A monthly investment of 2.6% is suggested.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days indicates a recent weakening in NVDL's outperformance relative to VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (342.1%) should be viewed with extreme caution.  It likely reflects an extrapolation of recent exceptional performance and doesn't account for the risks inherent in leveraged ETFs.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news headlines confirm the high-risk, high-reward nature of NVDL.  They highlight its leveraged exposure to NVIDIA, discuss strategies for using it, and point out both the potential benefits and the dangers.  The articles in Seeking Alpha and Motley Fool offer balanced perspectives.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

NVDL is a *highly* leveraged ETF that has delivered exceptional returns recently due to the strong performance of NVIDIA.  However, it comes with significant risk, as evidenced by its high beta and maximum drawdown.  Its leverage amplifies both gains and losses, making it unsuitable for long-term, risk-averse investors.

**Summary of Key Points:**

*   **High Return:** NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.
*   **High Risk:**  Leveraged ETFs are inherently risky.  Expect large price swings. A major risk is the leveraged effect, which can greatly amplify losses.
*   **Short-Term Focus:** NVDL is designed for short-term tactical trading, *not* long-term investing.
*   **NVIDIA Dependent:** NVDL's performance is entirely dependent on NVIDIA's stock performance.
*   **Divergence:** Recent divergence decline is suggesting prices are heading down.

**Recommendation (General, NOT Financial Advice):**

*   **For aggressive, experienced traders who understand leverage:**  NVDL might be a tool for short-term gains.
*   **For most investors:**  Avoid NVDL.  The risks outweigh the potential rewards.
*   **If considering NVDL:** Allocate only a very small portion of your portfolio and use strict stop-loss orders.  Be prepared to lose your entire investment.
