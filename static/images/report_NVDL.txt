2025-12-28 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided data for NVDL, comparing it to VOO (S&P 500), with the analysis structured as requested:

**0) Overview**

*   **NVDL:** Performance data, risk indicators, moving averages, and recent news.
*   **VOO (S&P 500):** Used as a benchmark for comparison.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (NVDL vs. VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) aims to provide *two times* the daily investment results of the common stock of NVIDIA (NVDA), before fees and expenses. (Leveraged ETFs are generally designed for short-term trading.)
*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 177.72%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 71.46%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current:** 82.2
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 19.2
    *Divergence (max: 428.0, min: 0.0, current: 82.2, relative divergence: 19.2)
       (Relative divergence indicates the current position when the minimum-maximum fluctuation range is set to 100. For example, a relative divergence of 90 means it is located at the top 90% percentile of past data, not that it is 90% superior to the comparison stock.)

*   **Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:**

    |            | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
    |------------|----------|----------|----------|------|--------|
    | 2022-2024  | 225.0%   | 76.2%   | 181.0%   | 0.1  | 0.0    |
    | 2023-2025  | 148.0%   | 76.2%   | 80.0%   | 0.1  | 0.0    |

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows very high growth rates over both periods, indicating strong returns. However, be aware that past performance is not indicative of future results, especially with leveraged ETFs. The CAGR decreased significantly in the 2023-2025 period, suggesting reduced returns in recent times.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** A significant drawdown of 76.2% in both periods highlights the substantial risk associated with this leveraged ETF.  This means that at one point, the investment lost over three-quarters of its value.
    *   **Alpha:** Large positive alphas (181.0% and 80.0%) indicate that NVDL has significantly outperformed its benchmark (likely NVIDIA itself, not VOO) after adjusting for risk. The Alpha decreased significantly in the 2023-2025 period.
    *   **Beta:** A beta of 0.1 suggests NVDL has low relative volatility compared to the market, this is in contradiction to the CAGR and MDD
    *   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization is relatively low.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 92.03
*   **Previous Close:** 90.28
*   **Change:** 1.94
*   **5-day SMA:** 88.416
*   **20-day SMA:** 83.9713
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.5608

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is above all its moving averages, indicating a potential uptrend. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, further supporting this uptrend. However, the 60-day SMA being slightly below the current price suggests caution, as it might act as a resistance level.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - This is a *very* aggressive recommendation for a leveraged ETF, especially considering its inherent risk.  It contradicts other risk indicators. The MRI is likely a flawed or simplistic indicator.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.44 - This indicates slightly bullish momentum, but not overbought.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.84 - A positive PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, signaling bullish momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-09) -  Recommends a very high allocation to the stock, contradicting the cautionary notes regarding risk and leverage. The "safe" designation is misleading.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 3.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Price Fluctuation Reflection:** The change of 1.94 from the previous close reflects a moderate increase.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 438.8% - This is an *extremely* high expected return. It is likely based on a very optimistic scenario and should be treated with extreme skepticism. This is the expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years).

*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   **Significant Outperformance:** NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in the analyzed period, but at a much higher risk level.
    *   **High Volatility:** The large MDD and the nature of leveraged ETFs indicate substantial potential for losses.
    *   **Short-Term Focus:** NVDL is best suited for short-term trading strategies focused on capitalizing on Nvidia's momentum.
    *   **Divergence Fluctuations:** The relative divergence suggests NVDL is currently in a relatively low position compared to past performance, but this doesn't necessarily mean it's undervalued.
    *   **Conflicting Indicators:** The MRI and Hybrid Signal are overly optimistic and should be viewed with extreme caution. They contradict the inherent risks associated with leveraged ETFs.
    *   **News Summary:** Recent news highlights both the potential benefits and significant risks of investing in NVDL, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and risk management.
    *   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism. Leveraged ETFs are not designed for long-term investment, and their performance is highly dependent on short-term market conditions.

*   **Recommendation (General Disclaimer: I am an AI and cannot provide financial advice):**

    *   **Risk-Averse Investors:** Should *avoid* NVDL due to its high volatility and potential for significant losses.
    *   **Experienced Traders:**  May consider NVDL for short-term trading strategies if they have a strong understanding of leveraged ETFs, risk management, and Nvidia's stock.
    *   **Due Diligence:** Conduct thorough research on Nvidia and market conditions before investing in NVDL. Understand the mechanics of leveraged ETFs and their decay over time.
    *   **Position Sizing:**  Allocate only a small percentage of your portfolio to NVDL that you are willing to lose completely.
    *   **Stop-Loss Orders:** Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses.
    *   **Monitor Closely:**  Monitor the investment frequently due to the rapid changes in value that can occur.

In summary, while NVDL offers the *potential* for high returns, it comes with *substantial* risks. The MRI and Hybrid Signal should be viewed with skepticism, and investors should prioritize a thorough understanding of leveraged ETFs and a robust risk management strategy before considering an investment in NVDL.
