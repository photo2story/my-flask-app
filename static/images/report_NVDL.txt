Okay, here's an analysis of NVDL based on the information you provided, presented in English with a focus on key figures and insights.

## NVDL (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF) Analysis

**Company Overview:** Aims to provide 2x the daily performance of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock.

**1. Performance Review:**

*   **Cumulative Return:** NVDL: 221.01%, S&P 500 (VOO): 66.53%
*   **Relative Divergence:** Current: 154.5, Relative Divergence: 36.1 (on a scale where min-max divergence range is 0-100). This indicates NVDL is performing substantially better than S&P 500, but the relative divergence suggests it is not at its historical peak outperformance.
*   **Key Metrics (2022-2024 & 2023-2025 Averages):**

| Metric | Value      |
|------------|------|
| CAGR   | 225% / 191%  |
| MDD | 76.2%   |
| Alpha  | 181% / 128%   |
| Beta | 0.1   |
| Cap(B) | 0.0  |

*   **Analysis:**  NVDL has shown impressive CAGR and Alpha, significantly outperforming the market. However, the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) of 76.2% highlights the substantial risk associated with this leveraged ETF. The low Beta indicates the return is relatively independent to the broad market return, which is the benefit of having high alpha.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 94.19
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 95.94, Previous Close: 94.19, Change: +1.86.  This shows a recent positive price movement.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day MA: 89.94
    *   20-day MA: 84.87
    *   60-day MA: 85.24

*   **Analysis:** The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. The 5-day MA is above the 20-day MA, which is above the 60-day MA, reinforcing this bullish signal. The recent change of +1.86 also indicates positive momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Outlook:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended).  This suggests the model views NVDL as a favorable investment based on its risk profile.
*   **RSI:** 62.02.  This is near the overbought level, suggesting the price might be approaching overvaluation, but not yet extreme.
*   **PPO:** 1.29.  A positive PPO indicates the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, confirming the uptrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (10 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 2.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)".  This indicates a strong buy signal based on the model, with a recommendation to allocate all available cash.
*   **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +6.1. This confirms a short-term increase in outperformance relative to its benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** 158.9%. This is the expected outperformance over the S&P 500 if investing with Dollar-Cost Averaging over a longer term (2+ years).

**4. Recent News & Events:**

*   **Zacks:** "NVIDIA Falls on Data Center Misses: Buy the Dip with ETFs?" - Suggests a potential buying opportunity after a recent pullback.
*   **etf.com:** "Nvidia Breaks Out, but Leveraged ETF NVDL Lags Behind" -  Highlights that while NVIDIA itself is performing well, NVDL might not be capturing the full upside.

**5. 종합 Analysis:**

NVDL offers the potential for substantial returns due to its leveraged exposure to NVIDIA. The technical indicators and recent price action point toward a continuing upward trend. The MRI suggests a favorable risk profile. However, the high MDD and the etf.com article caution against complacency.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Leverage:** NVDL is a leveraged ETF, making it inherently riskier than a non-leveraged investment. Be prepared for significant price swings.
*   **Daily Reset:** Leveraged ETFs reset daily, which can lead to erosion of returns over time, especially in volatile markets.
*   **NVIDIA Dependence:** NVDL's performance is entirely dependent on NVIDIA. Any negative news or underperformance from NVIDIA will significantly impact NVDL.
*   **Data Center Concerns:** The Zacks article highlights potential concerns about NVIDIA's data center business, which could impact its stock price.

**Conclusion:**

NVDL presents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for investors who are bullish on NVIDIA. The recent data suggests continued positive momentum, but investors should be aware of the risks associated with leverage and the potential for NVIDIA-specific headwinds. The "buy the dip" sentiment from the Zacks article could be a viable strategy for risk-tolerant investors, but careful monitoring and a well-defined exit strategy are crucial. The discrepancy noted in the etf.com article (NVDL lagging NVIDIA's breakout) warrants further investigation to understand the specific reasons behind this underperformance.
