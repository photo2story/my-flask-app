**0) Report in English**

**1) Return Rate Comparison: NVDL vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **NVDL Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF is a leveraged ETF designed to provide twice the daily investment results of the common stock of NVIDIA.
*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 167.27%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 65.32%
*   **Divergence:** 102.0
*   **Relative Divergence:** 23.7

**Analysis:**

*   NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in cumulative return.
*   The 2x leverage on NVIDIA's daily performance has amplified gains (and potentially losses).
*   The relative divergence of 23.7 suggests the current difference in returns is relatively low compared to its historical divergence range, indicating a potential for further outperformance (or a larger divergence if NVIDIA performs very well).
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    |            | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
    | :--------- | :----- | :----- | :----- | :--- | :----- |
    | 2023 -2025 | 135.0% | 65.40% | 73.0%  | 4.0  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 135% - This represents the average annual growth rate of the investment over the period. It's a very high growth rate, indicating significant returns.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 65.4% - This is the maximum peak-to-trough decline experienced during the period. It's a large drawdown, reflecting the higher risk associated with leveraged ETFs.
*   **Alpha:** 73.0% - This measures the investment's performance relative to its benchmark (likely the performance of 2x NVDA). A positive alpha indicates that the investment has outperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** 4.0 - This measures the investment's volatility relative to the market (or its benchmark). A beta of 4.0 suggests that the investment is significantly more volatile than the market or its benchmark. For every 1% move in the market, NVDL is expected to move by 4%.
*   **Cap(B):** 0.0 - This likely refers to the fund's capitalization in billions of dollars. A value of 0.0 could mean the fund is relatively small or the data is not available.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 90.03
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 90.03, Previous Close: 88.01, Change: 2.3%
*   **5-day SMA:** 89.77
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.35
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.20

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is currently above both its 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend.
*   However, the current price is slightly below the 60-day SMA, indicating a possible longer-term resistance level.
*   The recent 2.3% increase suggests positive momentum in the very short term.

**3) Index Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 58.08
*   **PPO:** 1.29
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (10 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 2.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.6 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 342.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI of 0.8:**  Suggests a medium level of risk and a recommendation for a moderate investment approach.
*   **RSI of 58.08:** Indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum.
*   **PPO of 1.29:** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is a momentum oscillator that shows the relationship between two moving averages. A positive PPO value suggests a bullish trend, as the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This seems to be an automated trading signal suggesting a strong buy position, but with a phased investment approach. The small number of shares to buy (10) and high investment percentage indicate that they are for testing purposes.
*   **Negative Change in Relative Divergence:**  The recent decline in relative divergence indicates that NVDL's outperformance compared to VOO has slightly decreased in the short term.
*   **Extremely High Expected Return:** A 342.1% expected return is exceptionally high and should be viewed with considerable skepticism. Leveraged ETFs are inherently risky, and such projections are unlikely to be realized consistently.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

NVDL offers the potential for high returns due to its leveraged exposure to NVIDIA. However, it comes with significant risk, as evidenced by its high MDD and Beta. The recent outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is notable, but the negative change in relative divergence suggests caution in the short term. The high expected return should be viewed with skepticism, as it reflects the inherent risk and volatility of leveraged ETFs.

**Conclusion:**

NVDL is suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance who have a strong belief in NVIDIA's continued success. It's crucial to understand the risks involved and to manage the position carefully, considering factors such as NVIDIA's stock volatility, interest rates, and the potential for decay in leveraged ETFs. Given that VOO contains hundreds of assets, the risk may be diversified.
