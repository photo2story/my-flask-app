## NVDL Stock Analysis (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF)

**Company Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) aims to deliver twice the daily performance of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock.

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 216.95%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 65.81%
*   **Spread:**
    *   Current Spread: 148.2
    *   Spread Range: 0.0 - 455.5
    *   Relative Spread: 32.5

**Analysis:** NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. However, the "Relative Spread" of 32.5 suggests the current outperformance is in the lower end of its historical range compared to VOO. This means that while NVDL is still outperforming, it's not as extreme as it has been in the past.

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Extremely high Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) indicates very strong growth, but also increased risk.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 76.2% is substantial, highlighting the significant downside risk associated with this leveraged ETF.
*   **Alpha:**  The high Alpha values (181%, 125%) indicate significant outperformance relative to its benchmark, meaning it's generating returns beyond what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:** Very low Beta values (0.1) indicate that NVDL's price is not very sensitive to market movements. This could be attributed to the 2x leverage factor.
*   **Cap:** 0.0 - indicates this ETF is a small cap fund.

### 4. Recent News & Analyst Opinions

*   **News:**
    *   **[2025-08-28] NVIDIA Falls on Data Center Misses: Buy the Dip with ETFs? (Zacks):** This headline suggests that NVIDIA experienced a recent dip due to data center concerns, but the article frames it as a potential buying opportunity.
    *   **[2025-07-16] Nvidia Breaks Out, but Leveraged ETF NVDL Lags Behind (etf.com):** This headline indicates that while NVIDIA had a breakout, NVDL's performance didn't fully reflect it, potentially due to factors like daily reset and volatility decay.

### 5. Overall Assessment

NVDL offers the potential for significant returns due to its leveraged exposure to NVIDIA. However, it comes with substantial risk. The high CAGR and Alpha are attractive, but the MDD of 76.2% should not be ignored.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Leverage:** NVDL is a 2x leveraged ETF, meaning it's designed to amplify the daily returns of NVIDIA. This can lead to significant gains, but also substantial losses.
*   **Volatility Decay:** Leveraged ETFs are subject to "volatility decay," which can erode returns over time, especially in volatile markets.
*   **NVIDIA Performance:** NVDL's performance is directly tied to NVIDIA's stock. Any negative news or performance issues with NVIDIA will significantly impact NVDL.
*   **Time Horizon:** Leveraged ETFs are generally not suitable for long-term buy-and-hold strategies. They are better suited for short-term tactical trading.
*   **News Sentiment:** The recent news headlines present a mixed picture. The data center concerns for NVIDIA warrant caution, while the "buy the dip" suggestion indicates some positive sentiment. The article about NVDL lagging behind NVIDIA's breakout highlights the challenges of leveraged ETFs.

**Conclusion:**

NVDL is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The technical indicators suggest positive momentum in the short term, and the MRI indicates a potentially favorable investment environment. However, the significant drawdown risk, volatility decay, and dependence on NVIDIA's performance make it suitable only for risk-tolerant investors with a short-term investment horizon. **Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in NVDL.** The recent news of NVIDIA's data center misses should be carefully monitored.
