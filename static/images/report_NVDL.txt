**NVDL (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF) Analysis**

GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 200% of the daily performance of the common stock of NVIDIA Corporation.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Cumulative Return:** NVDL: 222.27%, VOO: 66.76%
*   **Spread (Current):** 160.2
*   **Relative Spread:** 37.4 (Indicates the current spread is in the lower distribution of historical spread levels.)

**Analysis:** NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. However, the relative spread suggests the outperformance isn't at its historical peak.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
| --------- | ------- | ----- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| 2022-2024 | 225.0%  | 76.2% | 181.0%  | 0.1  | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025 | 192.0%  | 76.2% | 129.0%  | 0.1  | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Very high, indicating strong growth.
*   **MDD:** A large Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 76.2% signifies substantial risk. This is expected for a leveraged ETF.
*   **Alpha:** High Alpha values confirm NVDL's outperformance relative to its benchmark.
*    **Beta:** Very low Beta values could be a data error.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 94.56
*   **Previous Close:** 95.94
*   **Change:** -1.44
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 93.90
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 86.57
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 85.91

**Analysis:**  The price is slightly down today, but the 5-day MA is above the 20-day and 60-day MAs, suggesting an upward trend.

**3. Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 61.10 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 1.38 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)

*   **Expected Return:** 150.8% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests medium investment risk. The RSI is neutral, while the PPO indicates bullish momentum. The recent increase in relative spread supports short-term outperformance. The high expected return indicates significant potential upside over the long term.  The price decrease of -1.44 indicates a potential pullback, but needs to be viewed in context with the overall trend.

**4. Recent News & Analyst Opinions**

*   **News:**
    *   **NVIDIA Falls on Data Center Misses: Buy the Dip with ETFs? (Zacks):**  Suggests a recent negative catalyst (data center misses) but frames it as a potential buying opportunity.
    *   **Nvidia Breaks Out, but Leveraged ETF NVDL Lags Behind (etf.com):** Indicates that while NVDA itself is performing well, NVDL may not be fully capturing the upside, potentially due to leverage costs or tracking issues.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** (No specific consensus or target information provided).

**5. Overall Summary & Considerations**

NVDL offers significantly amplified returns compared to the S&P 500 and Nvidia (NVDA) itself, but with substantially higher risk, as evidenced by the large MDD.  Recent news indicates both potential buying opportunities and concerns about NVDL's ability to fully capture NVDA's upside.

*   **Key Positives:**
    *   High historical returns.
    *   Positive momentum indicators (PPO).
    *   High expected long-term return.
*   **Key Negatives/Risks:**
    *   Very high volatility and risk of significant losses (high MDD).
    *   Leverage decay can erode returns, especially in choppy markets.
    *   News suggests NVDL may not perfectly track NVDA's performance.
    *   Dependence on the performance of a single stock (NVIDIA).

**Recommendation:** NVDL is suitable only for risk-tolerant investors with a strong conviction in NVIDIA's continued growth and a deep understanding of leveraged ETFs. Investors should closely monitor NVDA's performance and be prepared for potentially large and rapid losses. The "Buy the Dip" narrative should be approached with caution, considering the leverage and potential tracking issues.
