Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of NVDL based on the provided data, presented in a clear and organized manner:

**0. Overview**

This report analyzes the performance and potential investment opportunities surrounding the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  It includes a review of historical returns, recent price fluctuations, market indicators, recent news, and a comprehensive summary.

**1. Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** NVDL
*   **Company Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF aims to provide 2x the *daily* performance of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock. Note this is a leveraged ETF, and designed for short-term trading, not long-term holding.
*   **Cumulative Return (NVDL):** 156.59%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 67.05%
*   **Divergence:** 102.0 (Relative Divergence: 23.7)

**Analysis:**

*   NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered.
*   The divergence of 102.0, with a relative divergence of 23.7 suggests that the performance difference, while large, is not at an extreme high compared to its historical range. In other words, the outperformance, while substantial, is within its normal range of fluctuation.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis (2023-2025):**
    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 135.0% - Extremely high growth rate, reflecting the leveraged nature and strong performance of NVDA.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 65.4% -  Very high drawdown, indicating significant risk and potential for large losses.
    *   **Alpha:** 73.0% - Significant alpha, meaning the ETF has generated returns beyond what would be expected based on its beta and the market's performance.
    *   **Beta:** 4.0 - Very high beta, indicating that the ETF's price is highly sensitive to movements in the underlying NVDA stock.  It moves significantly *more* than NVDA.
    *   **Cap(B):** 0.0 -  This likely refers to a capitalization-weighted benchmark, and a value of 0 suggests NVDL is not following a capital weighting scheme.

**In summary, the historical data shows NVDL has delivered exceptional returns, but with substantial risk as indicated by its high beta and drawdown.**

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close Price:** 86.43
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 86.17, Previous Close: 86.385, Change: -0.25
*   **5-day SMA:** 88.984
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.712
*   **60-day SMA:** 89.7952

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is below both the 5-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), but above the 20-day SMA.
*   This suggests a potential short-term downtrend (price below 5-day SMA) and that the 20-day SMA may serve as a level of support.  The 60-day SMA is acting as resistance.

**3. Indicators Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI:** 68.675 (Approaching overbought territory.  Generally, above 70 is considered overbought.)
*   **PPO:** 0.5144 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum, but needs to be interpreted relative to its historical range)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-05) - *Note: This specific signal seems to suggest buying a very small position (1 share), which is more about risk management than aggressive investment.* It suggests a conservative approach.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.6 (Negative): Short-term decline in relative divergence compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 342.1 - Extremely high expected return, but should be viewed with caution given the leveraged nature of the ETF and the potential for volatility. This suggests that NVDL is expected to significantly outperform the S&P 500 if held long term, but the risk is very high.

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI indicates a "Medium Investment" recommendation, suggesting moderate risk.
*   The RSI is nearing overbought territory, which *could* signal a potential pullback.
*   The negative change in relative divergence suggests short-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500, but the very high expected return tempers this.
*   The Hybrid Signal indicates a "Safe" recommendation, buying 1 share shows that it is more risk management than investment decision.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis & Summary**

NVDL is a leveraged ETF designed to amplify the *daily* returns of NVIDIA stock.  It has demonstrated substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, especially during periods of strong NVDA performance. However, it comes with significant risks:

*   **NVDA Dependence:** NVDL's fate is inextricably linked to NVDA's.
*   **Short-Term Focus:** Leveraged ETFs are generally not recommended for long-term holding due to the effects of compounding and daily resets.

Based on the provided data, the following considerations should be taken:

*   **Risk Tolerance:** NVDL is only suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a strong understanding of leveraged ETFs.
*   **Short-Term Tactical Tool:**  It's best used as a short-term tactical tool to capitalize on anticipated short-term movements in NVDA.
*   **Active Monitoring:** Requires constant monitoring and active management.
*   **Diversification:** Should not be a significant portion of an overall investment portfolio.
*   **Due Diligence:**  Thoroughly research NVDA's outlook and the risks associated with leveraged ETFs before investing.

The MRI indicates a "Medium Investment" recommendation. The high expected return should be tempered with the understanding of the ETF's inherent risks and volatility.
