2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Here's a breakdown of NVDL's performance and a comprehensive analysis based on the provided data:

**0) Simple Numbers:**

*   NVDL Cumulative Return: 132.93%
*   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 67.34%
*   NVDL Close Price: 77.18
*   5-day SMA: 78.01
*   20-day SMA: 82.79
*   60-day SMA: 90.69
*   RSI: 44.51
*   PPO: -0.738
*   MRI: 0.7

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **NVDL Company Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF aims to provide *twice* the daily investment return of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock.
*   **Cumulative Return:** NVDL significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 132.93% compared to VOO's 67.34%.
*   **Divergence:** The current divergence (75.0) is relatively low (relative divergence: 17.5) within its historical range. This suggests that while NVDL is still outperforming, the outperformance gap isn't currently at its peak relative to its history.
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**
    *   **2022-2024:** Very high CAGR (225%) with substantial Alpha (181%) indicates strong outperformance independent of the market. The Beta of 0.1 shows almost no correlation to general market movements (S&P 500) and Cap(B) of 0.0. The significant MDD (76.2%) highlights high volatility.
    *   **2023-2025:**  Lower CAGR (103%) but still impressive. Lower Alpha (39%) suggests a reduced level of outperformance compared to the earlier period. The Beta of 0.1 and Cap(B) of 0.0 remain the same. MDD remains at 76.2%.

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta Table:** NVDL demonstrates high growth potential, but it comes with significant risk. The period from 2022 to 2024 saw astronomical growth with large Alpha, showing it performed very well irrespective of the market. From 2023-2025 the growth decreased. The high MDD in both cases points to substantial drawdowns, which investors should be prepared for. The low Beta suggests its performance is largely tied to NVIDIA rather than the broader market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   The current price (77.18) is above the previous close (74.59), indicating a recent positive change (3.47).
*   The 5-day SMA (78.01) is slightly above the current price, indicating a possible short-term downward trend or consolidation.
*   The 20-day SMA (82.79) and 60-day SMA (90.69) are well above the current price, further reinforcing the potential downward trend in the medium-term.

**3) Index Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.7 falls into the "Medium Investment" recommendation category.  It suggests a moderate level of risk relative to other investments, but not the safest option.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 44.51 is neutral. It doesn't indicate the stock is overbought or oversold.
*   **PPO:** The PPO of -0.738 indicates the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests a mixed approach: 0% cash allocation and buy 90% of available cash (1 share). This "safe" signal is contradictory when MRI is 0.7.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence (-4.8) confirms the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The projected 490.5% return is exceptionally high. This reflects the leveraged nature of the ETF and its dependence on NVIDIA's continued growth.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Bullish Sentiment:** Several articles express bullish sentiment towards NVIDIA, particularly towards the end of the year ("Several Reasons To Be Bullish NVIDIA Into Year-End").
*   **Leverage Risks:**  Articles highlight the leveraged nature of NVDL, emphasizing both the potential benefits and risks ("How Much Nvidia Can You Handle? This ETF Is A 2x, For Better Or Worse").  The Motley Fool article outlines both reasons to buy and reasons *not* to buy, indicating a balanced perspective on the investment.
*   **NVDL Performance Relative to NVIDIA:** Some articles discuss NVDL's performance relative to NVIDIA's, suggesting that NVDL may not always perfectly mirror NVIDIA's gains ("Nvidia Breaks Out, but Leveraged ETF NVDL Lags Behind").
*   **Inflection Point:** One article mentions an "NVDL Inflection," suggesting a potential turning point or significant event influencing the stock's trajectory.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

NVDL offers the potential for very high returns due to its 2x leveraged exposure to NVIDIA. The historical data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by NVIDIA's growth. However, this comes with considerable risk, as evidenced by the high MDD and the warnings in the news articles.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **High Reward, High Risk:** NVDL is not a buy-and-hold investment for risk-averse investors. It's a speculative tool suitable for short-term trading strategies or those with a very strong conviction in NVIDIA's continued success.
*   **Dependence on NVIDIA:** NVDL's performance is *entirely* dependent on NVIDIA. Any negative news or downturn in NVIDIA's stock will be amplified in NVDL.
*   **Leverage Decay:** Leveraged ETFs are subject to "leverage decay," meaning that over time, their performance may deviate from the expected 2x daily return due to compounding effects.
*   **Recent Downward Trend:**  The SMA analysis, PPO, and recent relative divergence change all suggest a recent downward trend. The market risk indicator and hybrid signal show conflicting outlooks.
*   **News Sentiment:** The news articles present a mixed picture, acknowledging the potential rewards but also emphasizing the risks of leverage.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the data, NVDL is a **speculative investment** best suited for experienced traders with a high risk tolerance and a strong understanding of leveraged ETFs. Investors should carefully monitor NVIDIA's performance and be prepared to quickly adjust their positions. Given the recent downward trend, it might be prudent to wait for a clearer sign of stabilization or a renewed uptrend before considering an entry point. The analyst consensus, especially the target price, would provide further insight, but the lack of data in the source makes it hard to tell.
