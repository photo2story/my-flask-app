**Key Performance Metrics**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta | Cap (B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|------|---------|
| 2022-2024  | 225.0%  | 76.2%   | 181.0%  | 0.1 | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 168.0%  | 81.1%   | 104.0%  | 0.1 | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Very high Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for both periods, indicating substantial growth, especially in the 2022-2024 window.  However, note the decline in CAGR in the more recent period.
*   **MDD:**  Very high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures reflect the significant volatility and risk associated with this leveraged ETF.  Be prepared for substantial potential losses.
*   **Alpha:**  High Alpha values confirm the significant outperformance relative to its benchmark (NVIDIA, though implicitly here).
*   **Beta:** A Beta of 0.1 suggests it moves less than the broader market, which seems contradictory, given it's a 2x leveraged ETF based on a single stock.
*   **Market Cap:** Market capitalization is not applicable to this ETF.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 87.15
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 86.27, Previous Close: 87.15, Change: -1.01
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day: 87.81
    *   20-day: 90.43
    *   60-day: 87.66

**Analysis:**

*   The price closed lower than the previous day.
*   The price is below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term downward momentum.
*   The price is near its 60-day moving average, indicating that the recent downtrend hasn't yet broken the intermediate term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended).  This seems contradictory, given the leveraged nature and other risk factors. Consider this with extreme caution.
*   **RSI:** 39.88.  This indicates the asset is nearing oversold conditions, which could signal a potential rebound.
*   **PPO:** -0.88. The Negative PPO indicates short-term price weakness.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_79%_Sell 79.9% of holdings" - This is a very strong sell signal based on the hybrid indicator. It suggests significantly reducing exposure. The associated risk level of "Risky - MRI: 0.50" is a serious warning.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -2.2 (Negative) - Confirms the recent short-term downward trend.
*   **Recent Price Change:**  The price change of -1.01 relative to the previous close suggests a notable intraday or recent downward price movement, warranting attention.
*   **Expected Return:** 202.6% (over 2+ years vs. S&P 500).  This is a very high, long-term, projected outperformance *if* the investment thesis holds.

**4. News and Analyst Sentiment**

*   **News:**
    *   **[2025-10-15] Leveraged ETFs Keep Coming to Market. You Probably Should Avoid Them.** This article from Barrons.com is a general warning about the risks associated with leveraged ETFs.  It directly contradicts the MRI signal.
    *   **[2025-08-28] NVIDIA Falls on Data Center Misses: Buy the Dip with ETFs?**  This article highlights a specific instance where NVIDIA underperformed, leading to a potential "buy the dip" opportunity.  However, it also underscores the stock's inherent volatility and sensitivity to news.
*   **Analyst Consensus:** No analyst consensus data provided.

**5. Summary and Recommendation**

NVDL offers the potential for substantial returns due to its leveraged exposure to NVIDIA.  However, it comes with extremely high risk, as evidenced by the high MDD, the "Risky" hybrid signal, and warnings in the news regarding leveraged ETFs. The contradicting MRI indicator should be disregarded given the Hybrid Sell signal.

*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Leverage Risk:** The 2x leverage magnifies both gains and losses.
    *   **NVIDIA Dependence:**  Performance is entirely tied to NVIDIA's performance.
    *   **Volatility:** Expect significant price swings.
    *   **Hybrid Sell Signal:** The strong sell signal indicates a need to reduce exposure.

*   **Recommendation:**

    *   **For Risk-Averse Investors:**  Avoid NVDL. The risks are likely too high.
    *   **For Risk-Tolerant Investors:** If you understand the risks, consider reducing your position significantly, based on the Hybrid Sell signal. Do not allocate a substantial portion of your portfolio to this single, leveraged ETF. Closely monitor NVIDIA's performance and news flow. The long-term return projection is attractive, but comes with substantial downside risk.
    *   **Due to the recent price action, divergence change, and Hybrid Signal, a cautious approach is warranted. The Barrons.com article serves as a strong reminder of the inherent risks of leveraged ETFs.**
