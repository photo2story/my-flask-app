2025-12-13 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of NVDL based on the data you provided, following your instructions:

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Divergence Analysis**

*   **NVDL Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF aims to deliver twice the daily performance of Nvidia (NVDA) stock.

*   **Cumulative Return:**
    *   NVDL: 161.13%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO): 70.62%

*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current Divergence: 81.0
    *   Relative Divergence: 18.9%

*   **Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD:**

    |            | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
    |------------|---------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
    | 2022-2024  | 225.0%  | 76.2%  | 181.0%  | 0.1   | 0.0    |
    | 2023-2025  | 131.0%  | 76.2%  | 64.0%   | 0.1   | 0.0    |

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR is exceptionally high for both periods, showing substantial growth. However, the CAGR has decreased from the 2022-2024 to 2023-2025 period, indicating that the rate of growth has slowed down over the more recent timeframe. This could be due to increased market volatility or other factors impacting NVDA and leveraged ETFs.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is considerable (76.2%), highlighting the significant risk associated with this leveraged ETF. Investors should be prepared for potentially large losses.
    *   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are very high, indicating that the fund has significantly outperformed its benchmark (likely NVDA) after accounting for risk (beta). This is expected due to the 2x leverage. However, the Alpha has also decreased from the 2022-2024 to 2023-2025 period, which further supports the point that the rate of growth has slowed down.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta is low (0.1), which suggests the fund's volatility has decreased relative to the market.
    *   **Cap(B):** The fact that this is zero indicates that the fund has no market capitalization.
    *   **Divergence:** A relative divergence of 18.9% means that the current level of divergence is close to its lowest and that the price is in a short-term downtrend, which can be seen from the recent relative divergence change.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 86.53
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 78.3, Previous Close: 83.85, Change: -6.62
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 86.85
    *   20-day SMA: 86.63
    *   60-day SMA: 91.17

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The recent price of 78.3 is significantly lower than the current price of 86.53, which signifies a considerable rebound in stock price.
    *   The negative change in the last market data indicates a sharp decline.
    *   The 5-day SMA is slightly above the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term uptrend but a possible longer-term downtrend.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 44.59 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.53 (Positive but not exceptionally high)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)" (Suggests a bullish stance with a majority of available capital)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 435.5% (Significant potential outperformance vs. S&P 500 over a 2+ year horizon)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium level of risk.
    *   The RSI indicates that the stock is not currently overbought or oversold.
    *   The PPO suggests a positive trend, but not an extreme one.
    *   The hybrid signal suggests a bullish outlook for the investment, but with only a small amount of cash available.
    *   A 435.5% expected return is extremely high and should be viewed with caution. Leveraged ETFs are inherently risky.
    *   The recent 20-day relative divergence change confirms a short-term downtrend.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

NVDL offers the potential for significant returns due to its 2x leverage on Nvidia. The cumulative return significantly outperformed the S&P 500. However, this comes with substantial risk, as evidenced by the high maximum drawdown and the inherent nature of leveraged ETFs. Recent data shows a strong rebound in stock price, and a positive outlook for the stock, but there are still fluctuations and a downtrend in recent days.

*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Leverage:** The 2x leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Be prepared for volatility.
    *   **Nvidia Dependence:** NVDL's success is directly tied to Nvidia's performance. Any negative news or downturn in Nvidia will significantly impact NVDL.
    *   **Short-Term Trading:** Leveraged ETFs are generally not recommended for long-term holding due to the effects of compounding and potential decay.
    *   **Risk Tolerance:** This is a high-risk investment suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a thorough understanding of leveraged ETFs.

*   **Summary of Indicators:** The MRI suggests a medium investment, while the RSI shows the stock is neither overbought or oversold. The PPO shows a positive trend but not an extreme one.

*   **News Context:** The news articles emphasize both the potential rewards and the significant risks associated with NVDL. They highlight the dependence on Nvidia's performance and the volatile nature of the ETF.

*   **Recommendation (with caution):** NVDL could be considered a speculative buy if one is bullish on Nvidia and understands the risks involved. Given the recent sharp decline and the high expected return, it could be a good point to invest at a lower price. But given its high risk, it is not advised to hold NVDL as a long-term position. Thoroughly research Nvidia's outlook and be prepared to actively manage the investment.
