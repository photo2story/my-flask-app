2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Here's a breakdown of the provided data, along with analysis:

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **NVDL Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF seeks to achieve 2x the daily return of NVIDIA stock.
*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 165.59%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 69.56%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current Divergence: 96.0
    *   Relative Divergence: 22.4

**Analysis:** NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return. The 2x leverage amplifies NVIDIA's gains (and losses).  The current divergence of 96.0, with a relative divergence of 22.4, indicates that the difference in returns between NVDL and VOO is currently relatively low compared to its historical range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR      | MDD   | Alpha     | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|-------|-----------|------|--------|
| 2023-2025  | 1750.0%   | 88.8% | 1682.0%   | 4.0  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  A staggering 1750.0% indicates phenomenal growth, but this is over a limited timeframe (2023-2025) and highly influenced by specific market conditions.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 88.8% is *extremely* high. This signifies the potential for huge losses. A near 90% drawdown means an investor could lose almost 90% of their investment from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** 1682.0% represents the excess return compared to the benchmark (presumably the underlying NVDA return amplified).  This shows a significant ability to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis... at least during this period.
*   **Beta:** 4.0 indicates that NVDL is *highly* volatile, with movements 4x the movement of the underlying asset (NVDA).  This is expected due to the 2x leverage.
*   **Cap(B):** 0.0 indicates no significant market cap.

**Analysis:** The table paints a picture of very high reward and *very* high risk. The leveraged nature is evident in the extreme CAGR and Beta values. The substantial MDD highlights the danger of holding this ETF for the long term.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 88.01
*   **Last-market:** price': 88.01, 'previousClose': 89.04, 'change': -1.16 (Shows a recent dip in price)
*   **5-day SMA:** 89.824
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.0
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.2343

**Analysis:** The stock price closed at 88.01, experiencing a slight decrease from the previous close. The 5-day SMA is above the closing price, suggesting a recent downtrend. The 20-day SMA is significantly lower than both the 5-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating a possible short-term recovery from a deeper dip.  The closing price is below the 60-day SMA, which may signal further potential downward movement.

**3) Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium to High Investment Recommended).  This seems counterintuitive given the leveraged nature and MDD.
*   **RSI:** 51.90 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 1.36 (Positive but relatively low, suggesting a weak upward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-09). The "Safe" designation is misleading, again given the leverage.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.6 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Price Change Analysis:** The price change of -1.16 indicates a recent price fluctuation issue.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 726.84, Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point. The expected return is extremely high but must be balanced against the risks.

**Analysis:** The MRI is surprisingly positive, likely influenced by recent performance. The RSI is neutral. The PPO is positive, suggesting that the 20-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average.  The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent short-term decline. The high expected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism. Leveraged ETFs are *not* intended for long-term holding due to the effects of compounding and volatility decay.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes:** The news headlines consistently focus on NVDL as a way to leverage NVIDIA's momentum. They discuss the risks and rewards of using a 2x leveraged ETF.
*   **Mixed Sentiment:** Some articles highlight bullish outlooks for NVIDIA ("Several Reasons To Be Bullish"), while others caution about the risks associated with NVDL ("How Much Nvidia Can You Handle?").
*   **Breakout Concerns:** One headline notes that NVDL "Lags Behind" even when Nvidia breaks out, indicating that the leverage isn't always a guaranteed win.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Not provided:** There are no analyst consensus estimates, price targets, or recent changes to analyst ratings in the provided data.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

NVDL offers amplified exposure to NVIDIA's price movements, resulting in both substantial gains and losses. This leveraged ETF is highly volatile and unsuitable for risk-averse investors or long-term holding. Recent news articles highlight the inherent risks and the potential for NVDL to underperform even when NVIDIA performs well.

**Summary of Key Points:**

*   **High Risk, High Reward:** NVDL provides the potential for significant returns but carries substantial risk, as reflected in its high MDD and Beta.
*   **Not for Long-Term:** Leveraged ETFs are designed for short-term trading strategies. The effects of compounding and volatility decay can erode long-term returns.
*   **Recent Downtrend:** Recent price action and divergence data suggest a short-term decline.
*   **News Sentiment is Mixed:** While some see NVDL as a way to capitalize on NVIDIA's growth, others warn of the risks.
*   **MRI is Potentially Misleading:** The "Medium to High Investment Recommended" rating from the MRI should be disregarded given the inherent volatility and risks of a 2x leveraged ETF.
*   **Lack of Analyst Consensus:** The absence of analyst opinions suggests limited coverage or significant disagreement on the ETF's prospects.

**Recommendation:**

NVDL should only be considered by experienced traders with a high-risk tolerance and a short-term investment horizon. Thoroughly understand the mechanics of leveraged ETFs and the potential for significant losses before investing. Actively monitor the investment and be prepared to exit quickly if necessary.
