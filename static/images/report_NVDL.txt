Okay, here's a report summarizing the provided data and news about NVDL, along with some analysis.

**Report: NVDL (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF) Analysis**

**1. Performance Overview**

*   **Ticker:** NVDL
*   **Company:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (Aims to provide 2x the daily performance of NVIDIA stock.)
*   **Cumulative Return (NVDL):** 226.04%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 67.77%
*   **Return Spread:** 187.8 (Relative Spread: 43.9)

**Analysis:** NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period. The return spread of 187.8 indicates substantial outperformance.  A relative spread of 43.9 suggests that the current outperformance is in the lower half of its historical range relative to its peak. The ETF promises twice the performance of NVIDIA and its performance against the S&P500 shows it.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2022-2024  | 225.0%  | 76.2% | 181.0%  | 0.1 | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 196.0%  | 76.2% | 132.0%  | 0.1 | 0.0    |

**Analysis:** NVDL demonstrates exceptionally high CAGR and Alpha, indicating strong risk-adjusted returns relative to the market. However, a Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 76.2% suggests significant volatility and potential for large losses. The very low beta values suggests very low correlation with the S&P 500 index.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 109.68
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 96.32
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 89.96

**Analysis:**  The price is currently below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term pullback but a longer-term upward trend. The recent price increase of 2.28 indicates a short-term upward trend and some volatility, potentially due to news events.

**Analysis:**

*   The high MRI score suggests a favorable investment environment.

*   The positive change in the 20-day relative spread supports the recent upward trend.
*   A PPO of 1.69 means the 20-day exponential moving average is above the 60-day exponential moving average, indicating an upward trend.
*   The substantial expected return indicates a potentially high long-term return, but it's crucial to consider the ETF's leveraged nature and associated risks.
