2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's the analysis of NVDL based on the provided data, broken down into sections:

**0) Overview:**

NVDL is a leveraged ETF designed to provide twice the *daily* investment results of the common stock of NVIDIA Corporation. It's a high-risk, high-reward instrument that's not suitable for all investors.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (NVDL vs. S&P 500):**

*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 167.27%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 65.32%
*   **Divergence:** 102.0
*   **Relative Divergence:** 23.7

**Analysis:**

NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) during the period analyzed.  The 167.27% cumulative return is more than double the S&P 500's 65.32%. The divergence of 102.0 means NVDL has greatly exceeded the performance of VOO. However, the relative divergence of 23.7 indicates that the current outperformance is at the lower end of its historical range relative to its maximum historical outperformance against VOO, so there may be more room for growth.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| 2023-2025  | 135.0%  | 65.4%  | 73.0%  | 4.0  | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** A very high 135.0% indicates very strong annual growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** A high MDD of 65.4% reflects the high volatility and risk associated with this leveraged ETF.  Investors need to be prepared for potentially significant losses.
*   **Alpha:** A very positive alpha of 73.0% suggests NVDL is outperforming its benchmark (likely NVIDIA) by a significant margin, indicating that its performance is not solely due to market movements.
*   **Beta:** A high beta of 4.0 indicates NVDL is much more volatile than the market (likely NVIDIA again). It amplifies the movements of NVIDIA. If Nvidia stock increases by 1%, NVDL's price will increase by 4%.
*   **Cap(B):** A Cap(B) of 0.0 suggests that management has little impact on return.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 90.03
*   **Previous Close:** 88.01
*   **Change:** 2.3%
*   **5-day SMA:** 89.774
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.354
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.204

**Analysis:**

*   The recent price increase of 2.3% is a positive sign.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, suggesting short-term upward momentum.
*   The current price is below the 60-day SMA, which could indicate either a temporary pullback within a larger uptrend or a potential trend reversal, requiring further monitoring.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 58.08
*   **PPO:** 1.291
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (10 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 2.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.6 (단기하락) - Short-term decline
*   **Expected Return (%):** 342.1

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk, indicating that while not risk-free, it's not considered highly risky based on the model.
*   An RSI of 58.08 is in neutral territory, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   A PPO of 1.291 suggests the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, confirming short-term upward momentum.
*   The hybrid signal recommends buying with 90% of available cash and investing monthly.
*   The recent relative divergence change (-0.6) indicates a slight underperformance compared to its comparison asset.
*   The exceptionally high expected return of 342.1% should be viewed with extreme caution. It is a projection based on past performance and current conditions but does not guarantee future returns. This is especially true for leveraged ETFs, where returns can be amplified, but so can losses.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mostly focused on Nvidia and Leveraged ETF risks and rewards:** The news articles highlight the leveraged nature of the ETF, its dependence on Nvidia's performance, and the potential for both significant gains and losses.  They also discuss strategies for using the ETF and the risks involved.

**Analysis:**

The news articles emphasize the volatile and risky nature of NVDL. They underscore that it is a leveraged product and, as such, is highly sensitive to Nvidia's stock price. The articles present both bullish and bearish perspectives, suggesting that investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment goals before investing.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

NVDL is a high-risk, high-reward leveraged ETF tied to the performance of NVIDIA. It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 recently, but its high beta and maximum drawdown indicate substantial volatility and potential for losses. The news articles reinforce the importance of understanding the risks associated with leveraged ETFs. The technical indicators suggest short-term upward momentum, but the long-term trend is unclear. **The extremely high expected return should be viewed as a best-case scenario and not a guarantee.**

**Investment Recommendation (Disclaimer: This is not financial advice):**

NVDL is **only suitable for experienced investors with a high-risk tolerance and a strong understanding of leveraged ETFs.**  It is a speculative investment, and investors should be prepared for the possibility of significant losses.
