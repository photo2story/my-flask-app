2025-12-21 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided data and analysis of NVDL.

**NVDL Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF is designed to provide twice the daily investment return of NVIDIA stock.

## 1. Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 151.36%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 69.13%
*   **Divergence:** 75.0
*   **Relative Divergence:** 17.5

**Analysis:** NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The 151.36% return compared to VOO's 69.13% demonstrates the potential for high returns associated with leveraged ETFs. However, the divergence of 75 and a relative divergence of 17.5 indicate that the current divergence is relatively low compared to historical ranges, suggesting it is currently in the lower percentile compared to the analyzed timeframe.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2022-2024  | 225.0%  | 76.2% | 181.0%  | 0.1  | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 121.0%  | 76.2% | 56.0%  | 0.1  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is very high, indicating significant growth potential, but also high risk due to its leveraged nature.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is also very high, signaling substantial potential losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is substantial, showing NVDL's ability to outperform its benchmark (NVIDIA) on a risk-adjusted basis, primarily from 2022-2024.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is low (0.1), indicating that the fund is not much more volatile than the market. However, this is misleading because it is a 2x leveraged ETF and the volatility is embedded in the 225.0%/121.0% numbers.

## 2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations

*   **Current Close:** 83.29
*   **Previous Close:** 77.18
*   **Change:** 7.92
*   **5-day SMA:** 79.01
*   **20-day SMA:** 82.73
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.66

**Analysis:** The recent positive change indicates an upward trend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a potential short-term bullish trend that could be reversing, after a longer-term downward correction. The significant price change since the previous close highlights the volatile nature of this leveraged ETF.

## 3. Indicator Analysis

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 48.21
*   **PPO:** -0.20
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.8 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 490.5%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   An RSI of 48.21 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   A slightly negative PPO implies that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, which can signal a downtrend.
*   The hybrid signal suggests a buy signal with most cash being invested.
*   The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days reinforces the short-term downward trend indicated by the PPO.
*   The expected return is extraordinarily high, reflecting the potential rewards but also the risks involved in investing in a leveraged ETF.

Recent price action shows a short-term bounce. The technical indicators are mixed, with a neutral RSI, and MRI signals suggest a medium investment risk.

*   **Short-Term Trading Tool:** Leveraged ETFs are generally more suitable for short-term trading strategies than long-term investments.
