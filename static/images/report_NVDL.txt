2025-12-17 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided NVDL data, compared to VOO (S&P 500), incorporating the news headlines.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **NVDL Company Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF is a leveraged ETF that aims to deliver twice the daily performance of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock.

*   **Returns:**
    *   NVDL Cumulative Return: 143.04%
    *   VOO Cumulative Return: 68.06%
    *   Divergence: 90.5
    *   Relative Divergence: 21.1

*   **Analysis:** NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in cumulative return. The divergence between the two is substantial.  The *relative* divergence of 21.1 suggests that while the absolute difference is large, the *current* divergence is on the lower end of its historical range.  This implies that the outperformance of NVDL relative to VOO may have been more pronounced in the past than it is currently.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    |            | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
    |------------|----------|---------|---------|------|--------|
    | 2022-2024  | 225.0%   | 76.2%   | 181.0%  | 0.1 | 0.0    |
    | 2023-2025  | 113.0%   | 76.2%   | 49.0%   | 0.1 | 0.0    |

    *   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is very high for both periods, indicating strong growth. However, CAGR significantly decreased from 225% to 113% in the last period, showing that the growth is recently slowing down.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 76.2% is very high, illustrating the significant risk involved. This is to be expected from a leveraged ETF. This means that the investment at one point lost -76.2% value.
    *   **Alpha:** The Alpha is very positive, meaning NVDL has outperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis. Alpha also decreased sharply, indicating less relative outperformance recently.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta is low (0.1), indicating that the fund is less volatile than the market and has little correlation with the market.
    *   **Cap(B):** This value is 0, meaning it hasn't reached its capital limit.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close Price: 80.53
*   Previous Close: 79.45
*   Change: 1.36
*   5-day SMA: 81.73
*   20-day SMA: 83.99
*   60-day SMA: 90.99

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is slightly above its previous close, indicating a small recent gain. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term downtrend or consolidation after a longer period of stronger upward movement.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 48.18
*   PPO: -0.31
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   Recent 20-day relative divergence change: 2.2 (+), indicating a short-term increase
*   Expected Return: 381.9%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI of 48.18 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a possible downtrend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests allocating 90% of available funds, suggesting a bullish stance.
    *   **Relative Divergence Change:** The positive change in relative divergence suggests short-term upward momentum.
    *   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return is based on the historical performance of the fund and the analysis, but it is important to note that this is a leveraged ETF, and future performance is not guaranteed.
    *  **Price Change:** The change of 1.36 reflects a relatively small fluctuation today.

The recent signals suggest caution, and the headline about NVDL lagging Nvidia's breakout should be investigated further before making any investment decisions. The lack of analyst consensus information makes it difficult to assess the broader market sentiment towards NVDL.
