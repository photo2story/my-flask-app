2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided data, presented in a clear and concise manner:

**1) Return Rate Comparison (NVDL vs. VOO)**

*   **NVDL (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF):** This ETF aims to provide 2x the daily investment results of the common stock of NVIDIA.
*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 165.59%
*   **VOO (S&P 500 ETF) Cumulative Return:** 69.56%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 96.0
    *   Relative Divergence: 22.4

**Analysis:** NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in cumulative return. However, the relative divergence of 22.4 indicates that the current divergence is low compared to the divergence range over the observed period. This suggests that the difference in performance between NVDL and VOO, while still substantial, is currently closer to the lower end of its historical range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

|            | CAGR      | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
| :--------- | :-------- | :---- | :------- | :--- | :----- |
| 2023-2025  | 1750.0%   | 88.8% | 1682.0%  | 4.0  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 1750.0% - Extremely high, indicating rapid growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 88.8% - Very high, indicating significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** 1682.0% - Excess return compared to the benchmark (risk-free rate), also extremely high.
*   **Beta:** 4.0 - Indicates that NVDL is much more volatile than the market (S&P 500), with its price expected to move 4 times as much as the market.
*   **Cap(B):** 0.0 - Market Cap in Billions, it's strange that this is showing 0.

**Analysis:** The figures highlight the high-risk, high-reward nature of NVDL. The phenomenal CAGR and Alpha are attractive, but the substantial MDD and high Beta indicate a very volatile investment. It's strongly correlated with NVIDIA's performance, magnified by the 2x leverage. The data from Market Cap seems incorrect, as it would be a publicly available number.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 88.01
*   **Previous Close:** 89.04
*   **Change:** -1.16
*   **5-day SMA:** 89.82
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.00
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.23

**Analysis:**  The recent price has slightly decreased. The 5-day SMA is above the current price, suggesting a recent downward trend. The 20-day SMA is below both the current price and the 5-day SMA, indicating a shorter term uptrend over the last month. The 60-day SMA being above the current price and both the 5-day and 20-day SMA indicates that the stock is trending downward.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 51.90 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 1.36 (Positive)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.6 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 726.84%

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, though close to the "High Investment" threshold. The RSI is close to neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions. The PPO being positive suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating potential upward momentum, although mild. The Hybrid Signal suggests a mostly bullish outlook, though the MRI of 0.8 indicates some level of risk awareness. The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days suggests a weakening of NVDL's performance compared to VOO in the short term. The high expected return indicates strong upside potential based on the model.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Responsive Playbooks and the NVDL Inflection:** Likely discusses market timing.
*   **NVDL: How Much Nvidia Can You Handle?:** Highlights the leveraged nature and associated risks.
*   **NVDL: How to Play Nvidia’s Momentum With a Leveraged ETF:** Focuses on using NVDL for short-term gains during NVIDIA's price increases.
*   **2 Reasons to Buy NVDL and 3 Reasons Not to:** A balanced view of the pros and cons.
*   **NVDL: Several Reasons To Be Bullish NVIDIA Into Year-End:** Positive outlook based on NVIDIA's expected performance.
*   **Nvidia Breaks Out, but Leveraged ETF NVDL Lags Behind:** Indicates that sometimes the leverage doesn't perfectly mirror NVIDIA's performance.

**Analysis:** The news articles present a mixed view. They highlight the potential for high returns, but also emphasize the inherent risks of a leveraged ETF, especially the importance of carefully considering one's risk tolerance. Articles also focus on playing momentum which suggests it's not necessarily good as a buy-and-hold.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** *Missing from provided Data*

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

NVDL offers the potential for significant gains due to its 2x leverage on NVIDIA's stock. The historical data and expected return figures are alluring. However, the high volatility (MDD, Beta) and leveraged nature make it a high-risk investment. It is not a substitute for the investment into the underlying stock.

The recent price action suggests a slight downward trend, while the indicators provide a mixed signal. The news highlights the ongoing debate about the suitability of leveraged ETFs, with some articles focusing on short-term momentum plays. If the analyst consensus were available, we could have included that in the outlook for NVIDIA, but without that the analysis is limited to indicators.

**In conclusion:** NVDL is best suited for experienced investors with a high-risk tolerance who understand the implications of leverage and are comfortable with significant price swings. A careful assessment of NVIDIA's prospects is crucial before investing in NVDL. It's crucial to remember that leveraged ETFs are generally designed for short-term trading and may not be suitable for long-term investment due to the effects of compounding.
