Okay, here's an analysis of NVDL based on the provided information, presented in English with a focus on key metrics and their implications.

## NVDL (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF) Analysis

**Company Overview:** Aims to deliver twice the daily performance of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock.

**1. Performance & Volatility**

*   **Cumulative Return:** NVDL's cumulative return is **199.42%**, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) at **65.30%**.
*   **Relative Divergence:** The current divergence from VOO is **134.1**, with a relative divergence of **31.3**. This indicates that NVDL's outperformance is in the lower range of its historical outperformance relative to VOO, but still significant.
*   **Summary:** NVDL has strongly outperformed the S&P 500. However, the leveraged nature of the ETF implies a high degree of risk and volatility.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2022-2024  | 225.0%  | 76.2% | 181.0%  | 0.1  | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 169.0%  | 80.7% | 108.0%  | 0.1  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:** Very high Compound Annual Growth Rate.
*   **MDD:** Very high Maximum Drawdown, which highlights the risk involved.
*   **Alpha:** High alpha values suggest significant outperformance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500).
*   **Beta:** Low beta suggests the ETF is less sensitive to overall market movements (although, this seems counterintuitive given its leveraged nature and reliance on a single stock).
*   **Cap(B):**  The ETF's fund size is relatively small.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** \$89.24
*   **Recent Change:** Up \$1.48 from the previous close.  This recent jump in price signifies some momentum in NVDL, that should be reflected on the high change value in Last-market.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day: 88.86
    *   20-day: 90.48
    *   60-day: 87.57
*   **Summary:** The price is currently above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, but below the 20-day average. This suggests potential for short-term volatility but the recent market strength is reflected in the price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5 (Low Investment). Suggests relatively low risk.
*   **RSI:** 47.25 (Neutral).
*   **PPO:** -0.83 (Bearish).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** 'cash_80%_Sell 0.4% of holdings'. A signal to increase cash holdings and slightly reduce exposure.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.2 (Short-term downward trend).
*   **Expected Return:** 202.6%. High expected return, suggesting significant long-term outperformance potential compared to S&P 500.
*   **Summary:** Indicators are mixed, with the MRI suggesting low risk, but PPO is showing a bearish divergence, and a signal to sell a small portion of holdings. Delta is showing a recent downturn.

**4. News & Analyst Opinions:**

*   **News:**
    *   **[2025-10-15] Leveraged ETFs Keep Coming to Market. You Probably Should Avoid Them.** (Barrons.com):  Warns against the general risks of leveraged ETFs.
    *   **[2025-08-28] NVIDIA Falls on Data Center Misses: Buy the Dip with ETFs?** (Zacks): Suggests buying the dip on NVIDIA after a fall, potentially applicable to NVDL.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** No analyst opinions were provided.

**5. Overall Assessment:**

NVDL offers the potential for high returns due to its leveraged exposure to NVIDIA. However, the high MDD, leveraged nature, and the Barron's article cautioning against leveraged ETFs indicate a **high-risk investment**. The recommendation for higher cash holdings further supports this assessment.

*   **Investment Recommendation:** This ETF is suited only for investors with a **very high-risk tolerance** and a short-term trading horizon.  It's essential to closely monitor NVIDIA's performance and the overall market.  The long-term expected return is high, but the volatility makes it unsuitable for buy-and-hold strategies for most investors.  The news articles highlight the risks inherent in leveraged ETFs.
