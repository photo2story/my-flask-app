2025-10-14 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's an analysis of NVDL based on the data provided.  The report is structured to follow your numbered requests.

**NVDL Analysis - August 29, 2025**

**1. Performance Overview & Discrepancy vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** NVDL
*   **Company:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (Aims to provide 2x the *daily* performance of NVIDIA stock.)
*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 222.51%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 64.93%
*   **Discrepancy:** 153.5
*   **Relative Discrepancy:** 35.9 (Indicates NVDL's outperformance is in the 35.9th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO.)

**Analysis of Provided Table:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2022-2024  | 225.0%  | 76.2% | 181.0% | 0.1 | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 192.0%  | 76.2% | 131.0% | 0.1 | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  NVDL has exhibited very high growth rates over the periods shown. The CAGR is extremely volatile, indicating the riskiness tied to the leveraged nature of the fund.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** A significant MDD of 76.2% highlights substantial potential losses.  This is expected given the leverage and volatility of NVIDIA stock.
*   **Alpha:** The very high alpha values (181.0% and 131.0%) suggest significant outperformance relative to its benchmark *after* accounting for market risk.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of 0.1 indicates that, theoretically, NVDL's price is not very reactive to the overall market (VOO). However, this is misleading because it is leveraged to NVIDIA stock, not the S&P 500 directly. So it will actually be more reactive.
*   **Cap(B):** The 0.0 value listed here means that the fund's net asset value is less than one billion dollars.

**Important Considerations:**

*   Leveraged ETFs like NVDL are designed for *short-term* trading.  The daily reset can lead to significant erosion of returns over longer periods, especially in volatile markets.  The cumulative return difference, while impressive, doesn't tell the whole story of the ride along the way.
*   The relative discrepancy of 35.9 suggests that while NVDL is outperforming VOO, it's not at the extreme upper end of its historical outperformance range.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** \$94.63
*   **Previous Close:** \$89.61
*   **Change:** +5.6%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** \$93.21
*   **20-day Moving Average:** \$89.51
*   **60-day Moving Average:** \$87.17

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is above all three moving averages, indicating an upward trend.
*   The significant jump in price from the previous close (+5.6%) suggests strong recent momentum.

**3. Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment) - Suggests a moderate level of risk based on the MRI calculation.
*   **RSI:** 64.06 - Approaching overbought territory (typically > 70), indicating potential for a pullback.
*   **PPO:** 0.1963 - Positive PPO suggests the price is above its moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" - Aggressive buy signal. Recommends using all available cash to purchase the asset.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Discrepancy Change:** -1.5 (Decreasing) - Suggests short-term underperformance relative to VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** 162.6% (over 2+ years, relative to S&P 500) -  A very high projected outperformance, assuming a long-term dollar-cost averaging strategy.

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium-risk environment.
*   The RSI indicates that NVDL is gaining, but might be overbought.
*   The negative change in relative discrepancy, coupled with the increasing RSI, creates a conflicting indicator. This might be a signal to wait for a pullback before buying.
*   The large price change from yesterday could indicate a reaction to recent news (see below).
*   The very high expected return should be viewed cautiously. Leveraged ETFs are not typically suitable for long-term investments.

**4. Recent News & Analyst Opinions**

*   **News 1 (Aug 28, 2025):** "NVIDIA Falls on Data Center Misses: Buy the Dip with ETFs?" (Zacks) - Suggests a recent negative catalyst (data center misses) that may have created a buying opportunity.
*   **News 2 (Jul 16, 2025):** "Nvidia Breaks Out, but Leveraged ETF NVDL Lags Behind" (etf.com) - Highlights that NVDL's performance might not perfectly mirror NVIDIA's, due to the leveraged nature and daily reset.
*   **Analyst Consensus:** Not provided in the source data.

**Analysis:**

*   The news articles highlight the inherent risks and potential rewards of investing in NVDL.
*   The "buy the dip" article suggests a short-term trading opportunity based on a temporary setback for NVIDIA.
*   The second article reinforces the importance of understanding how leveraged ETFs work, and that one should not simply expect double the NVIDIA returns.

**5. Overall Summary & Recommendation**

NVDL is a high-risk, high-reward investment vehicle designed for short-term trading on NVIDIA stock. The fund has shown significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but comes with a high degree of volatility, as shown by the large Maximum Drawdown and high CAGR.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Short-Term Focus:** NVDL is not a buy-and-hold investment.
*   **High Risk:** Be aware of the potential for substantial losses.
*   **NVIDIA Dependence:** Your investment thesis is directly tied to the performance of NVIDIA.
*   **Due Diligence:** Carefully consider the risks and benefits before investing.
*   **Recent Volatility:** The large price jump yesterday and the conflicting signals from the RSI and relative discrepancy change suggest caution.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the data, a cautious approach is warranted. The recent price surge and mixed signals suggest waiting for a potential pullback before considering a *short-term* entry point. Thoroughly research NVIDIA's fundamentals and your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. If you are buying, make sure you have a plan to exit the position.
