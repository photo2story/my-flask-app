**Report on NVDL (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF)**

**Executive Summary:**

NVDL is a leveraged ETF designed to deliver twice the daily performance of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock.  It has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the past few years, but comes with high volatility.

    *   Relative Spread: 37.1
