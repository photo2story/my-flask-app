## NVDL Analysis - GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF

**1. Performance & Deviation:**

*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 174.35%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 63.03%
*   **Deviation:**
    *   **Current:** 95.3
    *   **Relative Deviation:** 17.6 (meaning the current deviation is in the 17.6th percentile of its historical range)

**Analysis:**

*   NVDL, an ETF designed to provide 2x the *daily* return of NVIDIA (NVDA), has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period examined.
*   The "Relative Deviation" indicates that while the absolute difference in cumulative return is large, the current divergence between NVDL and VOO is relatively low compared to its historical range. This suggests that the outperformance, while substantial, isn't at its extreme.

**Company Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF aims to deliver twice the daily investment results of the common stock of NVIDIA.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2022-2024  | 334.0%   | 68.5% | 290.0%  | 0.1  | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 141.0%   | 80.5% | 82.0%   | 0.1  | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR is extremely high, especially in the 2022-2024 period, reflecting significant growth. However, the CAGR is lower in the 2023-2025 period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD is high as well, indicating significant potential for loss. This is expected for a leveraged ETF.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha is substantial, suggesting significant outperformance relative to a benchmark, even after accounting for risk.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is very low, indicating it is insensitive to broad market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** The Cap value is at 0.0.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 84.40
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 91.09, 'previousClose': 84.4, 'change': 7.93}
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 83.24
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 83.77
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 82.70

**Analysis:**

*   The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.
*   The recent surge in price indicates a strong positive move that is also reflected in "Last-market", showing a significant single-day jump.

**3. Indicators & Signals:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3367 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 52.06
*   **PPO:** 0.0208
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_1%_Buy 80% of cash (26 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -4.5 (Negative - short-term decline in relative outperformance)
*   **Expected Return:** 600% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI is in the "Low Risk" range, suggesting a relatively stable market environment (at least according to this indicator).
*   RSI around 52 indicates a neutral momentum, not overbought or oversold.
*   A positive PPO suggests the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, confirming the uptrend seen in the price action.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a Buy, but with caution due to the MRI.  It recommends deploying most of the available cash.
*   The negative change in relative divergence suggests that NVDL's outperformance compared to VOO has decreased slightly in the recent 20-day period.
*   The massive expected return suggests extremely high potential upside over a long-term investment horizon (relative to the S&P 500).  This is highly speculative given the nature of a leveraged ETF.
*   The significant price change reported in {'price': 91.09, 'previousClose': 84.4, 'change': 7.93} should be considered a "급반등(rapid rebound/surge)".

**4. Recent News & Events:**

*   **[2025-08-28] NVIDIA Falls on Data Center Misses: Buy the Dip with ETFs? (Zacks):** Suggests potential buying opportunity despite a recent negative catalyst (data center results).
*   **[2025-07-16] Nvidia Breaks Out, but Leveraged ETF NVDL Lags Behind (etf.com):** Highlights that while NVIDIA broke out, NVDL didn't fully capture the upside, likely due to the daily reset and volatility drag inherent in leveraged ETFs.
*   **[2025-06-25] NVDA Hits New High as Analyst Sets Lofty Price Target (etf.com):** Positive news indicating strong analyst sentiment and momentum behind NVIDIA.

**5. Overall Assessment:**

NVDL offers the potential for extremely high returns, but comes with substantial risk. The fund has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Leverage:**  NVDL is a *leveraged* ETF, meaning it is designed to amplify daily returns (both positive and negative). This makes it unsuitable for long-term buy-and-hold investors. The daily reset can lead to significant erosion of value over time due to volatility drag.
*   **NVIDIA Dependence:**  The fund's performance is entirely dependent on NVIDIA's stock performance. Any negative news or downturn in NVIDIA will have an amplified negative impact on NVDL.
*   **Recent News:** The news headlines paint a mixed picture. The "buy the dip" article suggests short-term opportunities, while the article about NVDL lagging during a breakout highlights the risks of leveraged ETFs.
*   **Expected Return:**  The 600% expected return is highly speculative and should be viewed with extreme caution. Leveraged ETFs are not designed for, and rarely achieve, such long-term outperformance.
*   **Recent Surge:** Given the 'Last-market' data, the sudden price increase to 91.09 indicates a significant event occurred, driving up the price. This warrants further investigation into the specific catalyst behind the surge.

**In summary:**  NVDL is a high-risk, high-reward investment vehicle suitable only for sophisticated traders with a short-term outlook and a strong understanding of leveraged ETFs. The recent price surge and the hybrid signal suggest a potential buying opportunity, but investors must be aware of the inherent risks and monitor the position closely. The negative change in relative divergence and the article about NVDL lagging NVIDIA's breakout serve as reminders of the volatility drag and potential for underperformance.
