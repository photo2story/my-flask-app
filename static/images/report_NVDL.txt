### 1) Return Rate Comparison and Overview

| Metric | NVDL (Review Stock) | VOO (Comparison Stock: S&P 500) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cumulative Return** | **155.82%** | **68.34%** |
| **Divergence** | 87.48 percentage points | |

**Ticker to Review:** NVDL (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF)
**Company Overview (1 line):** NVDL is a leveraged Exchange Traded Fund designed to provide twice (2x) the daily performance of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) stock.

#### Divergence Analysis
NVDL has delivered a cumulative return of **155.82%**, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO), which returned 68.34% over the same period. The absolute divergence is **87.5** percentage points.

*   **Relative Divergence (20.3):** The current outperformance gap between NVDL and VOO is located at the **20.3% percentile** of its historical range. This indicates that while NVDL's absolute return is massive, the current gap (premium) it holds over the S&P 500 is relatively narrow compared to the maximum divergence experienced historically.

#### Alpha, Beta Analysis (2023-2025)

| Year | CAGR | MDD | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2023-2025 | 135.0% | 65.4% | 73.0% | 4.0 | 0.0 |

**Analysis:**
This data reflects the extremely high-risk, high-reward nature of a 2x leveraged product tied to a hyper-growth stock (NVDA) during a bull market.
1.  **CAGR (135.0%):** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is exceptionally high, demonstrating phenomenal short-term gains.
2.  **MDD (65.4%):** The Maximum Drawdown is severe (nearly two-thirds of the value wiped out at one point), confirming the extreme volatility inherent in leveraged instruments, which are highly susceptible to decay and sharp drops in the underlying asset.
3.  **Beta (4.0):** An exceptionally high Beta indicates that NVDL is highly sensitive to broad market movements, moving roughly four times as much as the overall market (VOO), reflecting its leverage and sector-specific concentration.
4.  **Alpha (73.0%):** A massive positive Alpha confirms that NVDL has generated significant excess returns far beyond what its high Beta would typically predict, meaning the strategy (leveraging NVDA) has been highly effective during this period.

**Analysis:**

*   The price is **below the short-term (5-day) average (88.21)**, indicating recent downward pressure.
*   The price is **slightly above the intermediate-term (20-day) average (85.69)**, suggesting consolidation or potential support.
*   The price is significantly **below the longer-term (60-day) average (89.79)**, indicating that NVDL is currently operating within a longer-term bearish or declining trend channel.

### 3) Technical and Risk Indicator Analysis

| Indicator | Value | Interpretation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Market Risk Indicator (MRI)** | **0.7** (Low Investment Recommended) | High risk profile, typical for leveraged ETFs. |
| **RSI (14-day)** | 65.30 | Strong positive momentum, approaching overbought levels (70). |
| **PPO** | 0.2362 | Positive value, confirming underlying upward momentum. |
| **Hybrid Signal** | cash\_0%\_Buy 90% of cash | Indicates a strong "Buy" signal from the internal model. |
| **Recent Relative Divergence Change** | -3.4 (Short-term Decline) | NVDL's outperformance gap relative to VOO has narrowed slightly over the last 20 days. |
| **Expected Return (%)** | **425.0%** | Very high long-term expectation compared to the S&P 500. |

**Analysis:**
The technical indicators present a confident bullish signal (RSI 65, PPO positive, Hybrid Signal Buy 90%) despite the high-risk designation (MRI 0.7). The strong momentum suggests that the buying pressure tied to NVDA remains robust.

The **Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.7** cautions that NVDL carries a high degree of risk, consistent with its 2x leverage and massive MDD (65.4%). The recent **relative divergence change of -3.4** indicates that NVDL has slightly underperformed the S&P 500 on a relative basis over the last 20 days, potentially reflecting a period where underlying NVDA gains were modest or decay affected the ETF. The exceptionally high **Expected Return of 425.0%** assumes the underlying NVDA growth trajectory will continue and the leverage will successfully multiply those gains.

### 4) Recent News & Significant Events

Recent news coverage highlights the phenomenal returns NVDL has generated but consistently emphasizes the high-risk environment due to its 2x leverage.

*   **Focus on Volatility and Decay (2025-11/2025-06):** Headlines like "How Much Nvidia Can You Handle? This ETF Is A 2x, For Better Or Worse" (Seeking Alpha) and "2 Reasons to Buy NVDL and 3 Reasons Not to" (The Motley Fool) reinforce that NVDL is a product for highly aggressive investors who understand the risks of leveraged products, including decay.
*   **Lagging Effect (2025-07):** The ETF.com article "Nvidia Breaks Out, but Leveraged ETF NVDL Lags Behind" highlights the specific danger of leveraged ETFs: they track *daily* movements, and over longer periods, compounding losses or volatility can cause the leveraged ETF to underperform 2x the underlying stock's cumulative return.
*   **Historical Performance (2025-12/2026-01):** Multiple recent articles quantify the immense historical gains ("$100 into GraniteShares... would be worth this amount now"), attracting attention based on past performance, though this does not guarantee future results.

### 5) Comprehensive Analysis

NVDL represents a high-conviction, high-risk vehicle designed to capitalize on the explosive growth of NVIDIA. Its historical cumulative return of **155.82%** far exceeds the S&P 500 (68.34%), confirmed by an extraordinary Alpha (73.0%) and extreme volatility (Beta 4.0, MDD 65.4%).

**Key Takeaways:**

1.  **Exceptional Performance, Extreme Risk:** NVDL has functioned precisely as intended during a period of massive NVDA growth. However, this performance comes with an MDD of over 65%, classifying it as a "Low Investment Recommended" stock (MRI 0.7) suitable only for tactical trading or highly risk-tolerant investors.
2.  **Mixed Technicals:** While momentum indicators (RSI 65, PPO positive) and the internal Hybrid Signal are strongly bullish, the stock is currently trading below its short-term (5-day) and long-term (60-day) moving averages, suggesting the immediate upward trend is stalling or consolidating.
3.  **Relative Performance Deceleration:** The negative change in relative divergence (-3.4) over the past 20 days, combined with the low Relative Divergence score (20.3), suggests that the premium NVDL holds over the S&P 500 is not currently expanding significantly, indicating a potential cooling of market excitement or the impact of leveraged decay.
4.  **Leverage Caution:** News headlines consistently emphasize the inherent danger and volatility of holding this 2x daily ETF long-term, noting that it may lag behind 2x the actual cumulative NVDA return due to tracking errors and decay.

**Conclusion:** NVDL remains positioned for explosive gains if NVDA continues its strong performance (as suggested by the 425.0% Expected Return), but its high volatility and significant risk profile demand cautious, short-term management.
