2025-12-22 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of NVDL based on the provided data, following your instructions.

**0. Report in English**

**1. Return Rate Comparison and Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** NVDL
*   **Company Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF provides 2x leveraged exposure to the daily performance of NVIDIA stock.
*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 151.36%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 69.13%
*   **Divergence:** 82.2 (Relative Divergence: 19.2)

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD:**

|            | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2022-2024  | 225.0% | 76.2%  | 181.0%  | 0.1    | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 121.0% | 76.2%  | 56.0%   | 0.1    | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:** NVDL exhibits high compound annual growth rates (CAGR) exceeding 100% in both analyzed periods, reflecting its leveraged exposure to Nvidia's performance. The 2022-2024 CAGR is significantly higher, suggesting particularly strong Nvidia performance during that timeframe.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is considerable at 76.2% for both periods. This highlights the significant risk associated with leveraged ETFs. Investors should be prepared for potentially large declines.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is substantial, indicating NVDL's ability to outperform its benchmark (likely Nvidia stock itself, before leverage) on a risk-adjusted basis. The Alpha is higher in the earlier period (2022-2024), which correlates with the higher CAGR.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is relatively low at 0.1. Since it is a leveraged ETF based on NVDA (the underlying stock), theoretically the Beta should be 2, but it is actually very low. This suggests that the price correlation between them is low.

**Simple Analysis:**

NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  The high CAGR and Alpha indicate potentially attractive returns, but the very high MDD underscores the substantial risk. The relative divergence being at 19.2 suggests the current performance is relatively close to the minimum divergence seen in the past, indicating it is not as overvalued as it has been in the past.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 83.29
*   **Previous Close:** 77.18
*   **Change:** 7.92
*   **5-day SMA:** 79.008
*   **20-day SMA:** 82.7258
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.6573

**Simple Analysis:**

The stock price has seen a significant recent jump (change of 7.92). The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are below the 60-day SMA, which *could* indicate a potential short-term upward trend following a longer period of decline or stagnation. However, the relatively large recent change could be a sign of volatility.

**3. Analysis of RSI, PPO, and Other Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 48.21
*   **PPO:** -0.1982
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 3.5 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 438.8%

**Simple Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.7 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation.
*   The RSI of 48.21 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   The negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, potentially indicating a slight downward trend *before* the recent price jump.
*   The hybrid signal recommends buying, although the cash ratio is 0%.
*   The recent relative divergence change indicates a short-term upward trend.
*   The extremely high expected return suggests significant potential upside, but should be viewed with caution given the leveraged nature and volatility of the ETF.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

Here's a breakdown of the news headlines and their potential implications:

*   **Bullish Sentiment:** Several articles ("Several Reasons To Be Bullish NVIDIA Into Year-End") indicate a positive outlook for Nvidia, which directly benefits NVDL.
*   **Leverage Risk:** Articles like "How Much Nvidia Can You Handle? This ETF Is A 2x, For Better Or Worse" emphasize the amplified risk associated with leveraged ETFs.
*   **Momentum Play:** "How to Play Nvidia’s Momentum With a Leveraged ETF" suggests NVDL is suitable for investors seeking to capitalize on short-term positive momentum in Nvidia.
*   **Reasons to Buy/Not Buy:** "2 Reasons to Buy NVDL and 3 Reasons Not to" provides a balanced perspective, which is crucial for informed decision-making.
*   **NVDL Inflection:** "Responsive Playbooks and the NVDL Inflection" is hard to tell without knowing what the "NVDL Inflection" is, but if there is one it's likely to affect this ETF significantly.
*   **Lagging Behind:** "Nvidia Breaks Out, but Leveraged ETF NVDL Lags Behind" is concerning as a leveraged ETF should, by definition, move MORE than the target stock.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   No analyst consensus data was provided.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

NVDL offers the potential for high returns due to its leveraged exposure to NVIDIA.  The historical CAGR and Alpha figures are impressive.  However, this comes with significant risk, as evidenced by the high MDD and reinforced by news headlines explicitly warning about the dangers of leveraged ETFs.

The recent price jump, combined with a neutral RSI and negative PPO (before the jump), suggests a possible short-term upward trend but also highlights the inherent volatility.  The MRI indicates a medium investment recommendation, but the extremely high expected return should be tempered by the reality of the ETF's risk profile.

**Key Considerations and Risks:**

*   **Leverage:** The 2x leverage magnifies both gains and losses.
*   **Volatility:**  NVIDIA stock is already volatile; NVDL amplifies this.
*   **Decay:** Leveraged ETFs are not designed for long-term holding due to the potential for "decay" as daily returns are compounded.
*   **News Sentiment:** While some news is positive, the warnings about leverage risk are crucial.
*   **Missing Analyst Data:**  The lack of analyst consensus makes it harder to gauge external expectations.
*   **Divergence Lagging Behind:** Is the underlying asset NVDA outperforming the NVDL stock. This may indicate a problem with NVDL.

**Conclusion:**

NVDL is a high-risk, high-reward investment suitable only for sophisticated investors with a strong understanding of leveraged ETFs and a high tolerance for volatility.  It should be considered a short-term tactical play rather than a long-term investment. Due diligence is crucial, and investors should carefully weigh the potential benefits against the substantial risks before investing.
