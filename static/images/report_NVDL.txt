2025-12-03 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of NVDL based on the provided data, broken down into sections for clarity.

**0) Report Introduction**

This report analyzes GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL), focusing on its performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), technical indicators, and recent news. The aim is to provide a concise overview for informed decision-making.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (NVDL vs. S&P 500)**

*   **Company Overview (NVDL):** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF is a leveraged ETF designed to provide twice the daily investment results of the common stock of NVIDIA.

*   **Cumulative Return - NVDL:** 155.12%
*   **Cumulative Return - VOO (S&P 500):** 68.61%
*   **Divergence:** 77.3
*   **Relative Divergence:** 18.1

**Analysis:** NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period for which cumulative returns were calculated. This is expected due to its leveraged nature, amplifying NVIDIA's price movements. However, the relative divergence of 18.1 suggests the divergence is in the lower percentile of past data.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta  | Cap(B) |
| :--------- | :------- | :------- | :------- | :---- | :----- |
| 2022-2024  | 225.0%   | 76.2%   | 181.0%   | 0.1 | 0.0  |
| 2023-2025  | 125.0%   | 76.2%   | 60.0%   | 0.1 | 0.0  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows high growth rates, especially from 2022-2024. The CAGR from 2023-2025 is still very strong but lower, suggesting some moderation in the rate of increase.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** A high MDD of 76.2% indicates substantial risk and potential for significant losses. This is a key consideration for investors.
*   **Alpha:** Significant positive alpha (181% and 60%) demonstrates that NVDL's returns have exceeded what would be expected based on the market (S&P 500) alone. This highlights the value added by the fund's strategy.
*   **Beta:** A very low beta of 0.1 suggests NVDL has low systematic risk, but it is likely because of how it is calculated from the underlying stock rather than direct relationship between fund and index.
*   **Cap(B):** The cap is zero (most likely a very tiny number displayed as zero)

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 84.50
*   **Previous Close:** 83.25
*   **Change:** 1.5
*   **5-day SMA:** 83.26
*   **20-day SMA:** 91.86
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.00

**Analysis:**  The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a recent downtrend. The 5-day SMA being below the current price suggests a short-term bounce. The positive change from the previous close indicates a recent upward movement, but it's within the context of a broader downward trend compared to the longer-term moving averages.

**3) Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 32.73 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.44 (Negative, indicating a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (9 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Monthly invest 2.7% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -5.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 457.1%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation; however, this should be viewed with caution given the leveraged nature of the ETF.
*   The RSI indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, *but* should not be interpreted in isolation, as leveraged ETFs can remain oversold for extended periods during downtrends.
*   The negative PPO confirms the recent downtrend signaled by the moving averages.
*   The hybrid signal gives a strong buy signal, suggesting an attractive entry point given the risk/reward profile.
*   The negative recent divergence change reinforces the short-term downward trend.
*   The extremely high Expected Return (%) is a projection based on past performance and should not be taken as a guarantee of future results. Leveraged ETFs are inherently volatile and can underperform significantly if the underlying asset does not move in the predicted direction.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes:** The news articles highlight the leveraged nature of NVDL, its potential for high returns and significant risks, and its relationship to NVIDIA's performance.
*   **Specifics:**
    *   Several articles focus on how to use NVDL to capitalize on Nvidia's momentum.
    *   One article suggests reasons to be bullish on NVIDIA into year-end, implicitly supporting NVDL.
    *   Other articles caution about the risks associated with leveraged ETFs, highlighting the "for better or worse" dynamic.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis & Summary**

NVDL is a high-risk, high-reward leveraged ETF designed to amplify the daily performance of NVIDIA. It has delivered substantial returns in the past, significantly outperforming the S&P 500, as reflected in its historical CAGR and Alpha. However, the high MDD highlights the potential for significant losses.

The recent price action indicates a short-term downtrend, with the price below key moving averages. Technical indicators such as the RSI suggest the stock is approaching oversold territory, and the PPO confirms the downtrend. The MRI indicates "High Investment Recommended," but this should be tempered with an understanding of the significant risks involved in leveraged ETFs. The hybrid signal also gives a strong buy signal.

The news articles emphasize both the potential rewards and the inherent dangers of investing in a 2x leveraged ETF.  The ETF's returns are highly dependent on NVIDIA's performance, and any negative news or downturn in NVIDIA's stock could lead to significant losses for NVDL investors.

**Conclusion:** NVDL is suitable *only* for sophisticated investors with a high-risk tolerance who have a strong conviction about the future performance of NVIDIA and understand the potential for significant losses. While the technical indicators suggest a possible short-term bounce, the overall trend and the leveraged nature of the ETF warrant caution. Conduct thorough due diligence and consider your own risk tolerance before investing.
