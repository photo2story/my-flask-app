2025-12-07 - Analysis Report
Here's an analysis of the provided data for NVDL, compared to VOO (S&P 500), along with a summary:

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Analysis:**

*   **Ticker:** NVDL (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF)
*   **Company Overview:** A leveraged ETF designed to provide twice the daily investment results of the common stock of NVIDIA.
*   **Cumulative Return (NVDL):** 150.50%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 69.53%
*   **Divergence:** 77.3
*   **Relative Divergence:** 18.1

**Analysis:**

NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return. However, it is important to remember that NVDL is a leveraged ETF, which means it amplifies both gains and losses. The divergence of 77.3 represents the difference in cumulative return, while the relative divergence of 18.1 suggests that the current divergence is relatively low compared to its historical range (near the bottom 20% of historical divergence).

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table:**

|            Year       |   CAGR |   MDD |   Alpha |   Beta |   Cap(B) |
|:-----------------|-------:|------:|--------:|-------:|-------:|
| 2022-2024          |  225   |  76.2 |   181   |    0.1 |      0 |
| 2023-2025          |  120   |  76.2 |    55   |    0.1 |      0 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Extremely high CAGR indicates significant growth, but this is typical for leveraged ETFs during periods of strong performance by the underlying asset (NVIDIA). The decrease in CAGR between the two periods suggests a slowdown in the rate of growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Very high MDD indicates a significant potential for loss. 76.2% drawdown means the investment lost 76.2% of its value at some point within the given timeframe.
*   **Alpha:** High positive alpha suggests NVDL has significantly outperformed its benchmark after accounting for risk.  The large Alpha values suggest skill or luck, however it does not necessarily account for the risks associated with the leverage aspect of the ETF.
*   **Beta:** A beta of 0.1 suggests NVDL has a very low correlation with the market. Note that the Beta is low due to the short history of the ETF and it is not a good representation of reality (most likely closer to 2.0).
*   **Cap(B):** Low Cap size suggests it does not affect the market much.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 82.95
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 85.34, Previous Close: 86.39, Change: -1.22
*   **5-day SMA:** 82.93
*   **20-day SMA:** 89.20
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.15

**Analysis:**

The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating a short-term downtrend. The price is slightly above the 5 day SMA. The last market change shows a slight decrease from the previous close.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 35.10 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** -0.96 (Negative, indicating a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (9 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 2.7% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -5.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 457.1% (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)

**Analysis:**

The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. The RSI is approaching oversold conditions, suggesting the potential for a rebound. The negative PPO confirms the recent downtrend. The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days indicates a weakening performance relative to the S&P 500. The Hybrid Signal suggests that it is a "very safe" opportunity to buy and that all available cash should be used to purchase more shares (although this signal seems inaccurate due to short history of data availability). The high expected return needs to be viewed with caution due to the leveraged nature of the ETF.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

The news articles present a mixed picture:

*   **Leverage Risks:** Several articles ("How Much Nvidia Can You Handle?", "Scalable Risk," "Better Safe Than Sorry") highlight the inherent risks of leveraged ETFs, emphasizing the potential for magnified losses.
*   **Playing Nvidia's Momentum:** Some articles ("How to Play Nvidia’s Momentum") suggest using NVDL to capitalize on NVIDIA's upward trends.
*   **Performance Lags:** One article ("Nvidia Breaks Out, but Leveraged ETF NVDL Lags Behind") notes that NVDL's performance hasn't always perfectly mirrored NVIDIA's gains, likely due to the daily reset and volatility.
*   **Reasons to Buy/Not Buy:** The Motley Fool article presents a balanced view, outlining both the potential benefits and risks of investing in NVDL.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   Analyst Consensus: Not provided.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

NVDL offers the potential for high returns due to its leveraged exposure to NVIDIA. However, it comes with significantly higher risk, as evidenced by the high MDD and the warnings in the news articles. The recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, though the RSI indicates it might be approaching oversold conditions.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Leverage:** The 2x leverage amplifies both gains and losses.
*   **Volatility:** Expect significant price swings. This is not a buy-and-hold investment.
*   **NVIDIA's Performance:** NVDL's performance is heavily dependent on NVIDIA's stock.
*   **Daily Reset:** The daily reset feature can erode returns over time, especially in volatile markets.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** This ETF is suitable only for investors with a high risk tolerance and a strong understanding of leveraged products.
*   **Time Horizon:** Designed for very short-term tactical trading.

**Recommendation:**

NVDL is not for everyone. It's a speculative tool best suited for experienced traders who are bullish on NVIDIA in the very short term and understand the risks of leveraged ETFs. The current technical indicators suggest caution, and the news articles highlight the potential for significant losses. Conduct thorough due diligence and carefully consider your risk tolerance before investing in NVDL.
