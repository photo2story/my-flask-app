**0) Report in English**

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** NVDL (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF)
*   **Company Overview:** A leveraged ETF designed to provide twice the daily investment results of the common stock of NVIDIA.
*   **Cumulative Return (NVDL):** 150.50%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 69.53%
*   **Divergence:** 77.3 (Relative Divergence: 18.1)

    *   **Analysis:** NVDL significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return. The divergence of 77.3 indicates a substantial difference in returns. However, the relative divergence of 18.1 suggests that the current divergence is relatively low compared to its historical range. This means that historically there were opportunities of a bigger outperformance of NVDL over VOO.

*   **Alpha:** The high alpha suggests that NVDL's returns are significantly exceeding what would be expected based on its beta. This could be due to the leverage and the specific performance of NVIDIA.
*   **Beta:** Very low Beta suggests that NVDL is not correlated with market fluctuation

    *   **High Growth Potential:**  The historical CAGR and expected return are exceptionally high, indicating the potential for significant gains.
    *   **Outperformance:** Has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **High Volatility & Risk:**  The high MDD, leveraged nature, and dependence on a single stock (NVIDIA) make it very risky.
    *   **Short-Term Downtrend:** Recent price action, moving averages, and PPO indicate a potential short-term downtrend.
*   **News Sentiment:** The news articles paint a mixed picture, with some highlighting potential opportunities and others emphasizing the significant risks.
*   **Investment Recommendation (Based on available data):**  NVDL is **not suitable for risk-averse investors**. It is more appropriate for experienced traders with a high-risk tolerance who are bullish on NVIDIA's long-term prospects and understand the implications of leverage. The current short-term downtrend and approaching oversold RSI might present a tactical entry point for those with a bullish outlook, but caution is paramount. Given the Hybrid signal, a small investment with a long-term prospective might be suitable for some investors.
