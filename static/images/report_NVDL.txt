2026-01-07 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided data and analysis, as requested:

**0) Report Presentation**

*   Numbers are presented first, followed by analysis.

**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** NVDL
*   **Company Name:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF
*   **Company Overview:**  This is a leveraged ETF designed to deliver twice the daily performance of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock.
*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 167.27%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 65.32%
*   **Divergence:** 102.0
*   **Relative Divergence:** 23.7

**Analysis:**

NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in cumulative return. The 167.27% return compared to VOO's 65.32% is substantial.  However, it's crucial to remember that this is a *leveraged* ETF.  Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. The relative divergence of 23.7 suggests that the current divergence is relatively low compared to the maximum recorded.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2023-2025  | 135.0%  | 65.4%  | 73.0%   | 4.0    | 0.0   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** A very high 135% CAGR indicates strong growth over the analyzed period (2023-2025).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  A 65.4% MDD is *extremely* high. This means the investment experienced a significant decline from peak to trough during the period. This highlights the risk associated with leveraged ETFs.
*   **Alpha:** The high alpha of 73% suggests that NVDL has significantly outperformed its benchmark after accounting for risk (beta).
*   **Beta:** A beta of 4.0 indicates that NVDL is *highly* volatile.  It's four times more volatile than the market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** A Cap(B) of 0.0 is not necessarily a data point that you can analyze from these results.

**Key Takeaway:**  While NVDL has delivered impressive returns, the high MDD and beta underscore the *substantial risk* involved.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 90.03
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 88.64, 'previousClose': 89.39, 'change': -0.84}
*   **5-day SMA:** 89.77
*   **20-day SMA:** 85.35
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.20

**Analysis:**

*   The last market data indicates a slight price decrease.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is a short-term bullish signal.
*   However, the 60-day SMA is slightly above the current closing price, suggesting potential resistance at that level.
*   The fact that the 20-day SMA is significantly lower than the other two suggests a recent upward trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Other Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.08
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.29
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (10 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 2.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.6 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 342.1% (Long-term)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A value of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation based on the model.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 58.08 is neutral.  It's neither overbought (above 70) nor oversold (below 30).
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, suggesting upward momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests buying with most of the available cash.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence indicates a recent short-term downward trend compared to the comparison stock.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return of 342.1% is a *very* aggressive projection and should be viewed with extreme caution.  It's based on historical data and doesn't guarantee future performance.
