## NVDL Analysis Report

**Ticker:** NVDL
**Company:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF

**Company Overview:**  This ETF aims to deliver twice the daily performance of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock.

### 1. Performance Analysis

**Key Metrics:**

*   **Cumulative Return (NVDL):** 98.76%
*   **Cumulative Return (S&P 500 - VOO):** 43.21%
*   **Spread Divergence (NVDL vs VOO):**
    *   **Current:** 111.3
    *   **Max:** 542.8
    *   **Min:** 0.0
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 20.5 (Indicates current divergence is in the lower range of its historical values).

**Analysis of Provided Table:**

The table shows the Alpha, Beta and CAGR for NVDL.
*   **High CAGR & Alpha:** The ETF demonstrates very high Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) and Alpha, especially in the 2022-2024 period.  This indicates significant outperformance compared to the benchmark, but also comes with substantial risk.
*   **Extremely High MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is extremely high at 99.7% for both periods, highlighting the very high volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Low Beta:** The Beta is very low, close to zero. This is unexpected for a leveraged ETF and may be an anomaly in the data or due to the specific calculation method.  Typically, a leveraged ETF tracking a single stock would have a Beta significantly greater than 1.
*   **Low Cap:** The Cap is very low, 0.0 (billion), but I can't confirm the unit is billion.

**Conclusion:**

NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but this comes with extremely high volatility and risk, as evidenced by the massive drawdown.
