2025-12-25 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the NVDL analysis based on the provided data, including simple numbers, analysis, and consideration of the news headlines.

**0. Report Introduction**

This report analyzes the GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) based on provided performance data, technical indicators, and recent news headlines. It compares NVDL's performance to the S&P 500 (VOO) and considers analyst opinions to provide a comprehensive overview.

**1. Return Rate Comparison (NVDL vs. S&P 500)**

*   **Company Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) is a leveraged ETF designed to deliver twice the daily performance of Nvidia (NVDA) stock.

*   **Cumulative Return (NVDL):** 151.36%

*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 69.13%

*   **Divergence:** 82.2 (Relative Divergence: 19.2)

*   **Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD:**

    *   **CAGR:** The high CAGR figures (225.0% for 2022-2024 and 121.0% for 2023-2025) demonstrate significant growth potential, but are highly dependent on Nvidia's performance.
    *   **MDD:** A Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 76.2% in both periods signals very high risk.  Investors need to be prepared for potentially large losses.
    *   **Alpha:** The high alpha values (181.0% and 56.0%) suggests NVDL has significantly outperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis during these periods. However, Alpha depends on Beta.
    *   **Beta:** A beta of 0.1 indicates that NVDL has very little systematic risk.
    *   **Cap(B):** The value of 0 indicates that the Sharpe Ratio cannot be defined.

**Analysis:** NVDL has substantially outperformed the S&P 500 over the provided period. The divergence of 82.2 and the high cumulative returns indicate strong positive relative performance. However, the high MDD reveals the substantial risk involved. The ETF is designed to amplify Nvidia's movements, which can lead to both significant gains and losses.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 83.29
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 90.28, 'previousClose': 90.8, 'change': -0.57}
*   **5-day SMA:** 79.01
*   **20-day SMA:** 82.73
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.66

**Analysis:** The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This *could* suggest a short-term upward trend (5-day moving average) that might be reversing or in a period of consolidation. The most recent price change (-0.57) indicates a slight pullback from the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 48.21 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.1982 (Slightly negative - suggests a potential weakening trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 3.5 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 438.8 (High expected return over a 2+ year horizon)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is neutral, indicating that the stock is not currently overbought or oversold. The slightly negative PPO suggests some potential downside momentum, but it's not a strong signal.  The Hybrid Signal is aggressive, reflecting the leveraged nature of the ETF. The high expected return is based on historical performance and the assumption that Nvidia will continue to perform well.  The recent increase in relative divergence implies an upward trend in the short term.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

NVDL offers the potential for substantial returns, as demonstrated by its historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, it is a high-risk investment due to its leveraged structure. The MDD and the news headlines serve as reminders of the potential for significant losses. The technical indicators provide a mixed picture. While the RSI is neutral, the PPO shows a potential weakening trend. The high expected return is attractive, but it is contingent on Nvidia's continued success.

Investors should carefully consider their investment objectives, time horizon, and financial situation before investing in NVDL.
