|            | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2022-2024  | 225.0%  | 76.2% | 181.0% | 0.1  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows very high growth rates for both periods, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, the CAGR is lower in the 2023-2025 period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** A significant drawdown of 76.2% in both periods indicates very high risk.  Investors must be prepared for potentially large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Positive alpha (181% and 56%) indicates the ETF's performance has exceeded what would be expected based on its beta (market exposure). This suggests skilled management or a favorable environment for the underlying asset (Nvidia).  Alpha is drastically lower in the more recent period.
*   **Beta:** A low beta of 0.1 suggests the ETF's price is not strongly correlated to the broader market. This is because the ETF is tied to a single company (NVDA)

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

NVDL offers the potential for substantial returns due to its leveraged exposure to Nvidia, as demonstrated by its high CAGR and alpha. The cumulative return vastly outperforms the S&P 500, however this is a double edged sword that is reflected in a high level of divergence.

However, it comes with very high risk, indicated by the substantial maximum drawdown. This ETF is not suitable for risk-averse investors.

The recent price action shows a strong rebound, reflected in the change in price relative to previous close. The short-term decline relative to the S&P 500 (negative divergence change) suggests potential headwinds. The MRI indicates a medium level of investment risk, which is reasonable, but the expected return is extremely high. The hybrid signal indicates that based on data, there is a buy opportunity.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Leverage:** NVDL's 2x leverage magnifies both gains and losses.  Daily resets mean it's not a buy-and-hold investment.
*   **Nvidia Dependence:** NVDL's performance is entirely dependent on Nvidia's stock performance.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** This is a very high-risk investment and only suitable for investors with a high tolerance for volatility and potential losses.
*   **Due Diligence:**  Thoroughly research Nvidia and understand the risks associated with leveraged ETFs before investing in NVDL.

**Recommendation:**

NVDL is appropriate only for highly sophisticated investors with a strong conviction in Nvidia's continued success and a very high risk tolerance. The high expected return should be viewed with caution, as it comes with significant potential for losses. Due to the leverage and dependence on a single stock, the ETF is best used for short-term tactical plays rather than long-term investment.
