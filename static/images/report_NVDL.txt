**0. Executive Summary:**

NVDL, a leveraged ETF focusing on NVIDIA, exhibits significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) but also carries substantial risk. Recent price declines and market risk indicators suggest caution, while long-term expected returns remain high. Recent news highlights both the fund's asset growth and warnings about leveraged ETFs.

**1. Performance Analysis:**

*   **Ticker:** NVDL
*   **Company:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (Aims to provide 2x the *daily* performance of NVIDIA stock)

*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 62.95%
*   **Relative Dispersion:**
    *   Current: 121.5
    *   Relative Dispersion: 28.4 (Positioned in the lower range of historical divergence)

    *Analysis:* NVDL has significantly outperformed VOO. The relative dispersion indicates that while NVDL has outperformed, its outperformance is currently not as extreme compared to its historical range.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis (2022-2024 & 2023-2025):**

| Year        | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |

*Analysis:* The high CAGR and Alpha figures indicate substantial outperformance relative to its benchmark. However, the large MDD (Maximum Drawdown) of 76.2% highlights the significant downside risk associated with this leveraged ETF. Beta is low, indicating low correlation with the market, which is unexpected considering the ETF's link to NVIDIA.

*   **20-Day Relative Dispersion Change:** 0.8 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 244.4% (Long-Term, vs. S&P 500)

*Analysis:*  The oversold RSI *could* suggest a potential bounce.  The negative PPO confirms the downward momentum. The MRI indicates a "Medium Investment Recommended" level of risk. The change in relative dispersion suggests a recent uptick in performance compared to VOO, but the price decline raises concerns. The very high expected return assumes a long-term investment horizon and continued outperformance of NVIDIA.
