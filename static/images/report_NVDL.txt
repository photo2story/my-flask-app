Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of NVDL, incorporating the data you've provided:

**GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) Analysis**

**Company Overview:** A leveraged ETF designed to provide twice the daily investment return of Nvidia (NVDA) stock.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 147.48%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 70.17%
*   **Divergence:** 90.9
*   **Relative Divergence:** 21.2

*   **Analysis:** NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. The divergence of 90.9 indicates a substantial performance difference. However, the relative divergence of 21.2 suggests that the *current* outperformance is relatively low compared to historical fluctuations between NVDL and VOO. This hints that the recent outperformance may not be as extreme as it has been in the past.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|----------|------|--------|
| 2022-2024  | 225.0%  | 76.2% | 181.0%   | 0.1  | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 117.0%  | 76.2% | 51.0%    | 0.1  | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:**  Shows very high annualized growth rates, but these are based on specific time periods and don't guarantee future performance. The CAGR has decreased substantially in the more recent period (2023-2025), indicating a slowdown in growth.
*   **MDD:**  A very high maximum drawdown of 76.2% in both periods. This indicates the ETF is extremely volatile and subject to significant losses.  This is expected of a leveraged ETF.
*   **Alpha:**  Very high Alpha values indicate significant outperformance compared to its benchmark (after adjusting for risk), particularly in the 2022-2024 period. Alpha also decreased substantially in the more recent period.
*   **Beta:** A low Beta indicates the fund is not highly correlated with market risk.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization (in Billions).

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 80.64
*   **Previous Close:** 83.62
*   **Change:** -3.56
*   **5-day SMA:** 82.90
*   **20-day SMA:** 93.03
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.86

*   **Analysis:** The current price is below all SMAs, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, further reinforcing this downtrend. The price decreased recently, which is reflected in the change of -3.56.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 40.12
*   **PPO:** -1.85
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (9 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 2.7% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -7.2 (Negative trend)
*   **Expected Return:** 369.1%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** Suggests a medium level of investment recommended.
    *   **RSI:**  A reading of 40.12 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), which could signal a potential buying opportunity *if* the downtrend reverses.
    *   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates the price is below its moving average and suggests a downtrend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends investing the entire available cash in NVDL, indicating a bullish outlook based on the indicator.
    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change confirms a recent decline in performance relative to the S&P 500.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return is *highly speculative* and based on projections that are likely tied to the performance of Nvidia. It's crucial to remember that leveraged ETFs can magnify both gains *and losses.*
