Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided data and a comprehensive analysis of NVDL.

**0) Summary of Data**

*   **Company:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL)
*   **Return:** NVDL significantly outperformed VOO (S&P 500).
*   **Risk/Reward:** High CAGR, MDD, Alpha, but low Beta and Cap(B)
*   **Price Action:** Recent price is below 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend.
*   **Indicators:** RSI indicates oversold conditions.
*   **Recommendation:** Current Hybrid Signal suggests a very safe investment with allocation to buying.
*   **Divergence Change:** Recent divergence change indicates short-term decline.
*   **News:** A mix of bullish and cautionary articles related to the leveraged nature of the ETF and Nvidia's performance.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (NVDL vs. VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) is a leveraged ETF designed to provide *twice* the daily investment return of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock.
*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 150.53%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 68.83%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   **Current Divergence:** 77.3
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 18.1

**Analysis:** NVDL has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return. However, the relative divergence of 18.1 suggests that the current divergence is at the low end of its historical range (0-428), suggesting the outperformance may have stalled, or is potentially correcting.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|------|--------|
| 2022-2024  | 225.0%   | 76.2%   | 181.0%   | 0.1  | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 120.0%   | 76.2%   | 55.0%    | 0.1  | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is extremely high, reflecting the leveraged nature and Nvidia's strong performance. Note the CAGR has dropped significantly in the most recent 2023-2025 period.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is also very high, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is substantial, meaning NVDL has significantly outperformed its expected return based on its beta. This implies the fund manager's ability to generate excess returns. Note the Alpha has dropped significantly in the most recent 2023-2025 period.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is very low (0.1), indicating that NVDL's price movements are very insensitive to the broad market. This is due to the ETF being tightly coupled to NVDA's stock price.
*   **Cap(B):** The value of Cap(B) is 0.0.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 82.96
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 82.85, 'previousClose': 84.55, 'change': -2.01}
*   **5-day SMA:** 82.6533
*   **20-day SMA:** 90.3688
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.096

**Analysis:** The recent closing price is below the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This suggests a short-term downtrend and that the stock price has been declining over the past few weeks. The `change` value in `Last-market` also supports this.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 35.677
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.1951
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (9 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 2.7% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -5.0 (단기하락 - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 457.1

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The high MRI score suggests that the model considers the market conditions favorable for investment, despite the inherent risks.
*   **RSI:** The RSI value of 35.677 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity. However, in a strong downtrend, RSI can remain oversold for an extended period.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO value suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, which confirms the downtrend indicated by the SMA analysis.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying using all available cash (9 shares), signaling the stock is very safe.
*   **Divergence Change:** The negative divergence change confirms the recent short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return (457.1%) is a significant and should be interpreted with caution, as it is a model-based prediction and doesn't guarantee actual returns. It suggests that the model anticipates substantial future growth.

*   **[2025-11-27]**  "NVDL: How Much Nvidia Can You Handle? This ETF Is A 2x, For Better Or Worse" -  Highlights the leveraged nature of the ETF and the increased risk associated with it.

**Analysis:** The news articles present a mixed picture. Some articles are bullish on Nvidia and, by extension, NVDL, suggesting potential for future growth. Others highlight the risks associated with leveraged ETFs and caution against overexposure. The article about NVDL lagging behind Nvidia's breakout is particularly relevant, as it shows that the 2x leverage doesn't always translate to a simple doubling of returns.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** (Not provided in the data)

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

NVDL is a high-risk, high-reward leveraged ETF designed to amplify the daily returns of NVIDIA stock. It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in recent periods, but the very high MDD indicates the potential for substantial losses.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Leverage:** The 2x leverage magnifies both gains and losses. This makes NVDL suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a strong understanding of leveraged products.
*   **Nvidia Dependence:** NVDL's performance is directly tied to Nvidia's. Any negative news or downturn in Nvidia's stock will have a magnified impact on NVDL.
*   **Short-Term Focus:** Leveraged ETFs are generally designed for short-term trading rather than long-term investment. The daily reset of the leverage can lead to erosion of returns over time due to compounding effects, especially in volatile markets.
*   **Recent Downtrend:** The recent price action, with the price below key moving averages, and the negative PPO, suggest a short-term downtrend. This may be a temporary correction, or it could signal a more significant pullback.
*   **MRI/Hybrid Signal Contradiction**: There is a contradiction here - the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation and the Hybrid Signal suggests the stock is very safe, however, the other data suggests an aggressive leveraged ETF with large swings, so it is important to assess the assumptions these signals make.

**Overall Recommendation (Disclaimer: This is not financial advice):**

Given the high risk and recent downtrend, NVDL is best suited for experienced traders who are bullish on NVIDIA and are comfortable with the risks associated with leveraged ETFs. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment time horizon before investing in NVDL. Consider setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. The high expected return is encouraging but should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. The current price action suggests caution, and it may be prudent to wait for a confirmation of an uptrend before initiating or adding to a position. Investors should do their own research and/or consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
