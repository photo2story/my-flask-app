Okay, here's an analysis of NVDL based on the provided data, presented with a focus on clarity and actionable insights.

**Executive Summary**

NVDL is a leveraged ETF designed to provide twice the daily return of NVIDIA (NVDA) stock. It has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in recent years, but with very high volatility. Current indicators suggest a high investment recommendation, but investors should be wary of the risks associated with leveraged ETFs and NVIDIA's inherent volatility.

**1. Performance Analysis: NVDL vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** NVDL

The "Relative Difference" metric (35.3) puts this in perspective; the outperformance is significant, but not unprecedented within the fund's history relative to the S&P 500.
