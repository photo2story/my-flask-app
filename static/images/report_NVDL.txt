## NVDL (GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF) Performance Report

### 1) Comparative Return Analysis

**Ticker:** NVDL
**Company Name Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF is a leveraged exchange-traded fund designed to provide 200% (2x) the daily return of the underlying NVIDIA (NVDA) stock.

| Metric | Review Stock (NVDL) | Comparison Stock (VOO) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Cumulative Return | **155.82%** | **68.34%** |
| **Outperformance (Divergence)** | **87.5%** | N/A |

#### Divergence Analysis
The cumulative return of NVDL (155.82%) significantly exceeds that of the S&P 500 (VOO, 68.34%), reflecting the massive growth of the underlying technology sector (NVDA) combined with the effect of 2x leverage. The absolute divergence is **87.5%**.

The **Relative Divergence** stands at **20.3**. This low figure indicates that while the absolute return is high, the current gap between NVDL and VOO is near the lower end of its historical fluctuation range, suggesting that NVDL's performance may have recently contracted relative to VOO, or that the period covered includes significant prior underperformance, though the cumulative result remains highly positive.

#### Alpha, Beta Analysis

| Year | CAGR | MDD | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 2023-2025 | 135.0% | 65.4% | 73.0% | 4.0 | 0.0 |

**Simple Analysis:**
1.  **CAGR (135.0%):** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is exceptionally high, demonstrating phenomenal short-term success, driven by the underlying asset's boom.
2.  **MDD (65.4%):** The Maximum Drawdown is severe. A 65.4% drop confirms the extreme risk and high volatility inherent in a 2x leveraged product.
3.  **Beta (4.0):** This is a critical risk indicator. A Beta of 4.0 means NVDL is four times more volatile and sensitive to market movements than the overall market.
4.  **Alpha (73.0%):** A very high Alpha suggests that NVDL has generated massive excess returns well beyond what its high Beta/risk level would predict, benefiting significantly from the non-systemic growth of NVDA.

### 2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Closing Price | **86.17** |
| Previous Close Change | -0.25 (Slight decline) |
| 5-day SMA | 88.212 |
| 20-day SMA | 85.694 |
| 60-day SMA | 89.7918 |

**Simple Analysis:**
The current closing price (86.17) closed slightly down (-0.25) from the previous day.

*   **Short-Term Weakness:** The price is currently **below the 5-day SMA (88.21)**, indicating short-term bearish pressure or a period of profit-taking/consolidation.
*   **Medium-Term Support:** The price is **above the 20-day SMA (85.69)**, suggesting that the medium-term upward trend is still marginally intact.
*   **Longer-Term Caution:** The price is notably **below the 60-day SMA (89.79)**. This confirms that NVDL has recently pulled back from its longer-term average, suggesting caution regarding the immediate continuation of a strong rally.

### 3) Indicator Analysis

| Indicator | Value | Interpretation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Market Risk Indicator (MRI) | **0.7** | Low Investment/Medium boundary (High risk profile acknowledged) |
| RSI (14-day) | **65.30** | Strong buying momentum, approaching overbought (above 70) but not yet excessive. |
| PPO (Momentum) | **0.2362** | Positive momentum is confirmed; the trend is currently pointing upward. |
| Relative Divergence Change (20 days) | **-3.4** | Short-term drop in divergence, indicating a cooling off or minor short-term pullback. |
| Expected Return (%) | **425.0** | Extremely high long-term expectation based on current momentum and leverage. |

**Simple Analysis:**
The technical indicators paint a picture of strong underlying momentum coupled with high risk.
*   The **RSI (65.30)** and **PPO (Positive)** indicate that buyers are still dominant, supporting the "Buy 90% of cash" Hybrid Signal.
*   However, the **MRI (0.7)** signals that the investment carries substantial risk, placing it at the lower threshold of the Medium Investment band.
*   The **Recent Relative Divergence Change (-3.4)** confirms the recent technical weakness (as seen in the SMAs), suggesting a short-term correction is underway, even as long-term expectations remain elevated (425.0% Expected Return).

### 4) Recent News & Significant Events

The recent news flow regarding NVDL is characterized entirely by the volatility, risk, and massive performance driven by its 2x leverage to NVDA.

*   **Focus on Risk/Reward:** Headlines consistently emphasize the dual nature of the ETF ("For Better Or Worse," "2 Reasons to Buy and 3 Reasons Not to"). This highlights the fund's extreme sensitivity to the underlying NVDA stock, where gains are magnified, but drawdowns (like the 65.4% MDD) are also severe.
*   **Performance Metrics Highlighted:** Articles in late 2025 and early 2026 quantify the enormous historical returns ("How Much You Would Have Made Owning..." and "If you had put $100..."). These reports validate the exceptional cumulative returns noted in Section 1.
*   **Leverage Behavior:** One article notes NVDL *lags behind* a specific NVDA breakout (2025-07-16), a common phenomenon for leveraged ETFs, which aim for 2x *daily* returns, leading to potential tracking errors and decay over longer periods, especially during volatile, choppy markets.

### 5) Comprehensive Analysis

NVDL is a high-stakes, high-leverage instrument that has delivered extraordinary historical returns, largely benefiting from the prolonged bull run and hyper-growth of NVIDIA.

**Performance and Risk:**
NVDL's cumulative return (155.8%) significantly outperformed VOO, but this came with commensurate volatility (Beta 4.0) and severe risk (MDD 65.4%). The fund's primary risk lies in its daily reset mechanism and the potential for severe decay during prolonged sideways or downward market movements in NVDA. The high Alpha (73.0%) confirms strong outperformance relative to its inherent systematic risk.

**Current Technical Status:**
Technically, NVDL is showing signs of short-term consolidation or weakness. The price sits below both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, supported only moderately by the 20-day SMA. This consolidation phase is confirmed by the negative short-term change in relative divergence (-3.4). Despite this recent cooling, momentum indicators (RSI 65.3, positive PPO) remain robust, supporting the strong buy signal.

**Outlook:**
The outlook is exceptionally bullish based on the 425.0% Expected Return, assuming the fundamental strength of NVDA continues unabated. However, investors must be fully aware that this ETF is a tool for short-term speculation rather than long-term buy-and-hold investing, as emphasized by the news focusing on the extreme "for better or worse" nature of the 2x leverage. The current **MRI of 0.7** serves as a strong cautionary flag, reminding investors that the potential for explosive gains is always balanced by the risk of catastrophic loss associated with a 4.0 Beta and high MDD.
