## NVDL Analysis: GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF

**Company Overview:** This ETF seeks to provide 2x the daily investment results of the common stock of NVIDIA.

### 1. Performance Analysis

    *   Current: 130.6
*   **Relative Divergence:** 30.5

**Interpretation:** NVDL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). However, the "Relative Divergence" of 30.5 indicates that the current outperformance is closer to the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. It means the current divergence, while substantial, isn't as extreme compared to past periods.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha     | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-----------|------|--------|
| 2022-2024  | 225.0%   | 76.2%   | 181.0%    | 0.1 | 0.0    |

**Interpretation:**

*   **CAGR:** Extremely high growth rates, reflecting the leveraged nature of the ETF and NVIDIA's strong performance.
*   **MDD:** Very high Maximum Drawdown, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Very high Alpha values, suggesting significant outperformance relative to its benchmark.

    *   "[2025-08-28] NVIDIA Falls on Data Center Misses: Buy the Dip with ETFs?" (Zacks)
*   **Analyst Consensus:** (No Data Provided)

**Interpretation:** The news headlines present a mixed picture.  One warns against leveraged ETFs in general, while the other suggests buying on a dip related to NVIDIA. This highlights the risk and volatility associated with this type of investment.

### 5. Overall Analysis

NVDL offers the potential for very high returns due to its leveraged exposure to NVIDIA. However, this comes with substantial risk, as evidenced by the high MDD and the general warning against leveraged ETFs.

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   Strong recent price momentum.
    *   Bullish technical indicators (PPO, Hybrid Signal).
    *   High expected future returns (with dollar-cost averaging).

*   **Weaknesses/Risks:**
    *   Very high volatility and potential for significant losses (high MDD).
    *   Leveraged nature amplifies both gains and losses.
    *   Dependence on the performance of a single stock (NVIDIA).
    *   General warnings against leveraged ETFs.
    *   The price has significantly increased, raising the possibility of a short-term price correction.

*   **Recommendation:**

NVDL is suitable only for investors with a very high risk tolerance and a strong belief in the continued success of NVIDIA. Given the high volatility, dollar-cost averaging over a long-term horizon is recommended to mitigate risk. Investors should be prepared for potentially large drawdowns. The recent price surge warrants caution, and it may be prudent to wait for a pullback before initiating or adding to a position.
