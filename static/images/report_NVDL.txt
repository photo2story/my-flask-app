2025-12-29 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the NVDL ETF, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO) and providing an analysis of its recent performance and outlook.

**Report:**

**1) Performance Comparison (NVDL vs. S&P 500):**

*   **Ticker:** NVDL
*   **Company Overview:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF provides 2x leveraged exposure to the daily performance of Nvidia (NVDA) stock.
*   **Cumulative Return (NVDL):** 177.72%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 71.46%
*   **Divergence:** 82.2
*   **Relative Divergence:** 19.2

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD:**

The table provides insights into NVDL's risk-adjusted performance:

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR is very high, indicating strong growth, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, since it uses leverages.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD of 76.2% is very high, meaning investors could experience substantial losses from peak to trough, which is a crucial consideration for risk management and due to the leverage.
*   **Alpha:**  The high Alpha (181.0% for 2022-2024, 80.0% for 2023-2025) shows NVDL's significant outperformance compared to what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:**  The low Beta (0.1) indicates that the ETF's volatility is not highly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500), even though NVDA stock itself is highly correlated. This is due to the daily rebalancing of the 2x leverage.
*   **Cap (B):** A Cap of 0.0B suggests a very small asset base, which can impact liquidity and tracking accuracy, and may increase expense ratios.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 92.03
*   **Previous Close:** 90.28
*   **Change:** 1.94
*   **5-day SMA:** 88.416
*   **20-day SMA:** 83.9713
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.5608

The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting short-term and medium-term bullish momentum. However, the fact that it's close to the 60-day SMA could indicate a potential resistance level.

**3) Analysis of Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended).  *Important Note:* This is a model-driven recommendation.  Given the leveraged nature of NVDL, a 1.0 MRI should be interpreted with extreme caution.  A high MRI score does not negate the inherent risks of a 2x leveraged ETF.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.44.  This is a neutral reading.  It's neither overbought (above 70) nor oversold (below 30).
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.8445.  This indicator measures the momentum of a stock. A positive PPO value indicates that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, suggesting an uptrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-09).  The model suggests a strong buy signal based on its parameters.
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** 3.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase). This indicates the divergence between NVDL and VOO has increased in the last 20 days.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 438.8%. *Important Note:* This is a model-driven expected return and should be viewed with skepticism, especially given the leveraged nature of the ETF. High numbers might be misleading.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Themes:** The news articles highlight key themes:
    *   **Leverage:**  The risks and rewards of NVDL's 2x leverage are consistently emphasized ("How Much Nvidia Can You Handle?").
    *   **Nvidia's Performance:** NVDL's performance is directly tied to Nvidia's. Bullish outlooks on Nvidia translate to bullish sentiments on NVDL.
    *   **Momentum:**  The ETF is seen as a way to play Nvidia's momentum, but lagging behind sometimes.
    *   **Risk Management:** The Motley Fool article presents both reasons to buy and not to buy, highlighting the risk factors.
    *   **Price Sensitivity:** One article points to the need for considering price-sensitive allocations with NVDL.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

NVDL offers a highly leveraged way to gain exposure to Nvidia.  Its recent performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial risk, as indicated by the very high Maximum Drawdown.  The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, *but this must be interpreted very carefully in the context of a leveraged ETF.* Leveraged ETFs are not suitable for all investors and are generally designed for short-term trading strategies.

The recent news highlights the key consideration: NVDL's performance is almost entirely dependent on Nvidia's.  Any negative news or downturn in Nvidia's stock could result in significant losses. The price is currently above its short-term and medium-term moving averages, indicating bullish momentum. However, the leveraged nature of the ETF means that these gains are amplified, as are any potential losses.

**In Summary:**

NVDL is a high-risk, high-reward investment vehicle.  Its high potential returns are balanced by its significant potential for losses. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance, investment horizon, and understanding of leveraged ETFs before investing in NVDL. The provided data and news suggest a cautious, informed approach, acknowledging the inherent volatility and dependence on Nvidia's performance. The expected return should not be taken as a guaranteed return.
