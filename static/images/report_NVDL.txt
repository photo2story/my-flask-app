**0) Basic Data & Analysis:**

*   **NVDL:** GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF

**1) Return Rate Comparison (NVDL vs. VOO):**

*   **Company Overview:** NVDL is a leveraged ETF designed to deliver twice the *daily* performance of Nvidia (NVDA) stock. This means it amplifies both gains and losses.
*   **NVDL Cumulative Return:** 168.70%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 70.46%
*   **Divergence:** 98.2
*   **Relative Divergence:** 22.9

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, and MDD:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 169.0% - This indicates extremely high annual growth, but remember it's leveraged and tied to a single stock.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 76.2% - This is very high. It means that at one point, the investment fell by 76.2% from its peak. High MDD is characteristic of leveraged ETFs and highlights the significant risk.
*   **Alpha:** 97.0% - This shows strong outperformance relative to its benchmark, likely driven by the leverage and Nvidia's performance.
*   **Beta:** 0.1 - A beta of 0.1 suggests that the fund has almost no correlation to the market and is likely closely tied to Nvidia's performance.
*   **Cap (B):** 0.0 - Indicates the fund is likely illiquid.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 89.04
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 90.3199, 'previousClose': 89.04, 'change': 1.44} -  A small increase in the last trading session.
*   **5-day SMA:** 90.382
*   **20-day SMA:** 84.6545
*   **60-day SMA:** 90.3658

**Analysis:** The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a recent upward trend, but the price is still fluctuating as it hovers around its 60-day moving average.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) -  This suggests the model interprets the current market conditions as favorable for investment, but be cautious as it is near the high end of the scale.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 51.72 -  A neutral RSI, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.63 - Slightly above zero, suggesting some short-term bullish momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)" -  Recommends a relatively high allocation to the asset with a small number of shares.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 2.2 (+) - Indicates a recent upward trend in divergence, suggesting outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the short term.
*   **Last Market Data Change:** {'price': 90.3199, 'previousClose': 89.04, 'change': 1.44} - A small price change. Larger fluctuations indicate a more volatile market.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 352.8 -  This is a very high expected return, but highly speculative and dependent on Nvidia's future performance. It also assumes that the leverage will work in the investor's favor.

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Not Provided.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

NVDL is a *highly speculative* investment vehicle.  It offers the potential for significant gains due to its 2x leverage on Nvidia, but it also carries substantial risks.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **High Risk, High Reward:** NVDL is not suitable for risk-averse investors. The high CAGR and potential expected return are enticing, but the MDD shows how quickly and deeply it can fall.
*   **Nvidia's Performance is Crucial:** Your investment's success is almost entirely dependent on Nvidia's stock doing well.
*   **Leverage Decay:** Leveraged ETFs are designed for *short-term* trading.  Over longer periods, volatility can erode returns due to daily rebalancing. This is known as "leverage decay." The article noting NVDL lagging behind despite Nvidia's breakout is an example of this.
*   **Consider Your Risk Tolerance:**  Before investing in NVDL, carefully assess your risk tolerance and investment goals.
*   **Stay Informed:** Closely monitor Nvidia's performance and any news that could impact its stock price.
*   **Diversification:** Do not allocate a significant portion of your portfolio to NVDL.
*   **MRI Signal needs confirmation:** Although current market is high investment recommended (0.9), there is still a recommendation to buy only 90% of cash and only a small number of shares.

**Recommendation:**

Due to the high risk associated with NVDL, it is generally not recommended for long-term investors or those with a low-risk tolerance. If you choose to invest, do so with a small portion of your portfolio and be prepared to actively manage your position. A thorough understanding of leveraged ETFs and the specific risks of NVDL is essential.
