**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data was provided, hindering a comprehensive financial analysis.  This is a critical omission.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

XOM's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, showing a considerable negative divergence. While the recent price action shows some short-term bearish pressure, the long-term outlook may differ considering the projected 5.5% excess return over the S&P 500.  However, this positive outlook is contingent upon the absence of crucial financial data (revenue and gross profit). The mixed earnings results and inconsistent alpha/beta values further complicate the analysis.  A deeper dive into financial statements, industry comparisons, and future growth prospects is crucial for a more complete assessment.  The lack of key financial data significantly limits the robustness of this analysis.
