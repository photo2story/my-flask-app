**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data is available, limiting the ability to perform a thorough fundamental analysis. This crucial information gap prevents a complete assessment of XOM's financial health and growth prospects.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

XOM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, although there have been periods of strong growth.  The lack of detailed financial information and the inconsistent performance indicated by alpha values hinder a complete assessment.  While the expected long-term return is positive, investors should exercise caution due to the volatility and underperformance relative to the broader market. A comprehensive analysis requires additional financial data (revenue, gross profit, etc.) and a deeper investigation into the reasons behind the inconsistent alpha values. The current slightly bearish short-term trend and neutral RSI should also be considered.
