## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While showing high RSI and relatively high recent volatility, the company demonstrates strong profitability and revenue, although recent earnings show a mixed picture. Further analysis is needed to determine whether the current valuation is sustainable.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) is an integrated oil and gas company engaged in exploration, production, refining, and marketing of petroleum products.

* **Cumulative Return (XOM):** 96.58%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 89.44%
* **Return Difference:** 7.14%
* **Relative Divergence:** 72.2% (Indicates XOM's performance is in the upper 72.2% percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO.  This is not a measure of outperformance in absolute terms but rather relative to its past performance compared to VOO.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO) over different periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others indicate negative alpha (underperformance), suggesting the stockâ€™s performance is not consistently better than the market.  The beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.  The significant increase in market capitalization from 2015 to 2025 reflects the company's growth and strong performance in recent years, particularly during 2020-2022.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $119.04
* **5-day Moving Average:** $118.37
* **20-day Moving Average:** $113.56
* **60-day Moving Average:** $110.37

The recent price shows a slightly upward trend, with the price above all three moving averages.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages suggests limited recent volatility, but this needs to be considered in light of other indicators.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4382 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 88.26 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.4386 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 4.2% (Long-term expected outperformance compared to the S&P 500)

The high RSI suggests the stock is overbought and might be prone to a price correction. While the PPO is positive, the high RSI and Medium Risk MRI need to be considered. The recent price change of $0.09 is insignificant enough to not be classified as a major jump or drop.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 2025-01-31 | 1.67    | 1.77        | -0.10       |
| 2024-11-01 | 1.92    | 1.88        | +0.04       |
| 2024-08-02 | 2.14    | 2.01        | +0.13       |
| 2024-04-26 | 2.06    | 2.20        | -0.14       |
| 2024-02-02 | 2.48    | 2.21        | +0.27       |

Earnings have been mixed, with some quarters exceeding expectations and others falling short.  The overall trend isn't immediately clear without further analysis,  and a simple comparison to expectations isn't sufficient to determine underlying profitability trends.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue (Billions) | Profit Margin |

| 2024-06-30 | $89.99            | 22.44%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $80.41            | 23.51%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $81.69            | 21.67%        |

Revenue is relatively stable with some fluctuations, while profit margins are consistently high and hover around 22%.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (Billions) | ROE (%) |
|---------|--------------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $263.70           | 2.89    |
| 2024-09-30 | $268.59           | 3.21    |
| 2024-06-30 | $268.40           | 3.44    |
| 2024-03-31 | $205.25           | 4.00    |
| 2023-12-31 | $204.80           | 3.73    |

Equity shows a noticeable jump between Q1 2024 and later quarters, which warrants further investigation. ROE fluctuates but remains relatively strong.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

XOM has shown strong cumulative returns exceeding the S&P 500, particularly during 2020-2022.  However, the high RSI indicates potential overvaluation and the need for caution. The mixed earnings results and inconsistent alpha values from the regression analysis require further investigation to determine the sustainability of current performance.  While the company demonstrates strong profitability and revenue, investors should carefully consider the technical indicators (RSI) and the mixed signals from recent earnings and the significant jump in equity before making investment decisions. A deeper dive into the fundamentals, including debt levels and future projections, is recommended before forming a conclusive opinion.  The 4.2% expected return over the long term against the S&P 500 should be viewed with caution due to the inherent uncertainties involved in future market performance.
