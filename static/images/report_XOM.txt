This results in a difference of -41.5%, placing it at the 39.1st percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided minimum and maximum divergence).

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in performance relative to the S&P 500, represented by the Beta and Alpha values.  The consistently low Alpha suggests that XOM has generally not outperformed the market in these periods, despite the high CAGR in 2020-2022.

* **Last Market Price:** $106.40

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $112.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $117.85

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The relatively close proximity of the 5-day and closing prices suggests limited recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 9.25 - This extremely low RSI indicates the stock is severely oversold.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.66 -  A negative PPO confirms the bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.5 - This slight positive change suggests a short-term upward bounce, but given the low RSI and PPO this may not be sustainable.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The provided expected return is 0%, meaning no significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is anticipated over the long term (2+ years) based on current data.  This is consistent with the consistently low alpha displayed over the provided periods.  A price of $106.40 is not significantly above the recent lows to suggest a dramatic rebound.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information on recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions is provided. This section requires additional input.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

XOM's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While recent earnings have shown some positive surprises relative to expectations in some quarters, there isn't a clear trend of sustained growth.  Technical indicators (RSI, PPO) point to a significantly oversold market, potentially creating a buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance. However, the lack of a significant positive long-term return outlook, along with the price being below its moving averages, warrants caution.  Further analysis of news, market outlook, and analyst opinions are necessary for a more complete assessment.

**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, XOM presents a high-risk, potentially high-reward investment opportunity.  The extremely oversold conditions suggest that a short-term bounce may be possible, but the consistently low Alpha, the price below its moving averages, and the lack of clear revenue growth trends indicates significant uncertainty. Investors should carefully assess the risk before making any investment decisions.  Additional information on recent news, analyst ratings and  the industry outlook is crucial in forming a more informed opinion.
