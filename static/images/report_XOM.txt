*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is also volatile, showing significant potential for losses in some periods.

*   **Beta:** Varies between 0.5 and 1.1, indicating that XOM's price tends to move in the same direction as the market (S&P 500), but the magnitude of the move can be slightly less or slightly more than the market. In the recent 2023-2025 period, it's at 0.5, suggesting lower volatility relative to the market.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization has fluctuated, with a general upward trend recently.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 122.65
*   **Previous Close:** 120.34
*   **Change:** 1.92
*   **5-day SMA:** 120.724
*   **20-day SMA:** 118.465
*   **60-day SMA:** 116.343

    *   **Analysis:** The stock price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term and intermediate-term upward trend. The recent significant price change (1.92) indicates notable positive price momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI:** 59.43 (Approaching overbought territory, but not yet there)
*   **PPO:** 0.3338 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 90% of cash (7 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80).  Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00).
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 5.9 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -57.8% (Expected *negative* excess return compared to S&P 500 over a long-term investment from this point.)

    *   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, while the RSI indicates the stock is nearing overbought territory.  The PPO confirms positive momentum.  The recommendation to buy 90% of cash with a small monthly investment suggests a cautious but optimistic approach.  However, the **very large negative expected return is a significant red flag**, suggesting that the model predicts XOM will underperform the S&P 500 substantially in the long term. The recent relative divergence change indicating a short-term upward trend is in contrast to the longer-term expected underperformance.

*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 131.56 / 158.00 / 109.00

    *   **Analysis:**  Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating with a target price slightly above the current price. This suggests they anticipate some upside.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Exxon Mobil (XOM) presents a mixed investment picture.

    *   Some positive news headlines about the company's performance and cash flow.
*   **Negatives:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the longer term.
    *   Volatile historical performance (CAGR and MDD).
    *   Largely negative Alpha, indicating underperformance relative to benchmarks.
    *   **Extremely negative expected return (-57.8%), suggesting the stock is expected to underperform significantly compared to S&P 500.**
    *   Geopolitical risks potentially impacting the oil market.

**Conclusion:**

While XOM shows short-term positive momentum and analysts have a generally positive outlook, the long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the particularly concerning negative expected return should give potential investors serious pause. The recent news headlines are mixed, and the geopolitical situation adds further uncertainty.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, particularly the negative expected return, a cautious approach is warranted. While the "Hybrid Signal" recommends buying a portion of the stock, consider carefully weighing the risks. Thoroughly investigate the reasons behind the negative expected return and consider alternative investments with more favorable long-term projections before making a substantial investment in XOM. The investor should be aware that the recent recommendation could be due to the short-term growth but is not in line with the long-term potential growth.
