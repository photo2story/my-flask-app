## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), one of the world's largest integrated oil and gas companies, shows a cumulative return significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While recent performance has been strong,  volatility and the company's sensitivity to macroeconomic factors need consideration.  Further analysis of financial statements, earnings, and technical indicators will provide a more comprehensive assessment.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Exxon Mobil Corp is an integrated oil and gas company engaged in exploration, production, refining, marketing, and transportation of energy resources.

The cumulative return for XOM is 81.74%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a return of 108.62%. This results in a current relative divergence of -26.9%, meaning XOM underperformed VOO.  The historical range of the relative divergence (-98.5% to 47.3%) positions the current underperformance at the 49.1th percentile.  This suggests that while XOM underperformed VOO recently, this level of underperformance isn't extremely unusual historically.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows fluctuating performance relative to the market. High CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) years, like 2020-2022 (106%), are offset by negative or low CAGR years.  The Beta values also suggest varying levels of market sensitivity, ranging from 0.0 to 1.2.  The substantial fluctuations in Alpha further point to the influence of factors beyond simple market movements impacting XOM's performance. Notably, the market cap shows a general upward trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

XOM's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, though it's important to note that the current underperformance isn't historically extreme.  Recent price action suggests upward momentum, supported by relatively healthy financial indicators such as high profit margins. However, fluctuating earnings and  volatility in CAGR and Beta highlight considerable market sensitivity and inherent risk.  The projected long-term excess return of 4.5% over the S&P 500 suggests potential, but a comprehensive risk assessment considering macroeconomic factors and industry trends is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the causes of earnings fluctuations is recommended.
