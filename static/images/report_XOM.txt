## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation.  The cumulative return of XOM (97.61%) lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) (130.06%) by 32.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -32.4% places it at the 49.8th percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  The provided alpha values are consistently 0.0, indicating it doesn't exhibit significant outperformance or underperformance relative to the market (as measured by Beta).  However, the substantial difference in cumulative returns between XOM and VOO suggests that over this period, the market (represented by the S&P 500) significantly outperformed Exxon Mobil.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $117.96 (Last market: $118.43)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $119.07
* **20-day Moving Average:** $119.28
* **60-day Moving Average:** $117.77

The stock price is currently trading slightly below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a mild downward trend in the short term.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support. The difference between the last market price and the closing price is negligible.  No significant recent price spike (up or down) is observed based on the provided data.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 42.13 (Slightly below the 50 threshold, suggesting the stock may be slightly oversold.)
* **PPO:** -0.24 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** NaN (Missing data prevents analysis.)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This implies no expected excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, based on the provided information.)  Long-term (2+ years) dollar-cost averaging may be a prudent approach given this forecast.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals some variability:

* **EPS Trends:** EPS shows a downward trend from Q4 2023 ($2.27) to Q3 2024 ($1.92).
* **Beats and Misses:**  The company missed EPS expectations in Q1 2024, Q2 2024, and Q3 2024, but beat expectations in Q4 2023.  The magnitude of these beats and misses varies.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates slightly quarter over quarter, with no clear upward or downward trend visible in the short-term data.  Further data is needed to identify longer-term trends.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margin has also fluctuated, ranging from 21.67% to 25.27%.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity shows a significant increase from Q1 2024, with a corresponding decrease in ROE.  This requires further investigation to determine the cause.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, or analyst opinions is provided.  This section needs additional data to be completed.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Exxon Mobil's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 over the measured period.  While recent earnings have shown some inconsistencies compared to expectations, the financial data shows some fluctuations in revenue, profit margin, equity, and ROE but doesn't reveal a clear overall trend. Technical indicators suggest slightly oversold conditions and bearish momentum, but the lack of data on recent relative divergence and the 0% expected return need further clarification.  More information is needed on recent news and analyst opinions to form a more complete assessment.  The company's historical alpha of 0 suggests a performance largely in line with the overall market.  Further analysis is needed regarding the underlying drivers of recent price movements and future outlook before making investment decisions.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the limited information provided, particularly regarding recent news and market outlook, definitive recommendations are impossible. Further research is required to address the knowledge gaps.  The provided data alone does not give a strong buy or sell signal, however, the lackluster performance against the S&P 500 and several quarters of missed earnings expectations raise concerns.  Investors should thoroughly investigate the underlying reasons for recent performance before making any investment decision.  A long-term perspective with dollar-cost averaging might be a reasonable strategy given the current data.  However, any investment decision should be made with careful consideration of one's own risk tolerance and financial goals.
