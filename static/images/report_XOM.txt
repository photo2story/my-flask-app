This report analyzes Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), a leading multinational oil and gas corporation engaged in exploring, producing, and marketing crude oil and natural gas.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

XOM's cumulative return is 76.07%, significantly lagging the S&P 500's 117.56% return.  The difference is -41.5%, placing it in the 39.1st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on provided data.  This indicates that XOM's underperformance relative to the broader market is notable but not entirely unprecedented within its historical context.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different time periods, suggesting varying levels of risk and return relative to the market. Note the very high CAGR in 2020-2022, but also the significant negative CAGR in 2018-2020.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $106.30
* **Last Market Price:** $106.40
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $106.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $112.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $117.85

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 9.25 (Extremely oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.66 (Negative momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +0.5 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0% (This suggests that, based on the provided data, there's no projected outperformance of the S&P 500 with a long-term investment, though this is only a single data point.)

The extremely low RSI indicates the stock is significantly oversold. However, the negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.  The positive short-term relative divergence hints at a potential short-term bounce. The low expected return, however, is notable and warrants caution. Given the provided data, there's no projected significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 with a long-term investment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The reported EPS has shown some volatility. While there have been instances of exceeding expectations (e.g., 2024-08-02, 2024-02-02), there have also been misses (e.g., 2024-04-26, 2023-10-27). There is no clear discernible trend in EPS.  Further analysis with more historical data would be beneficial.

XOM's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly, though short-term technical indicators suggest an oversold condition that *could* indicate a near-term bounce.
