XOM has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent earnings show some variability, the overall trend displays a slight decline.

Further investigation into the reasons behind the underperformance and a more comprehensive analysis of the company's future prospects are necessary before making any investment decisions.  The significant increase in equity from Q1 to Q2 2024 warrants further investigation.  The provided data is limited, requiring more detailed information for a complete and accurate evaluation.
