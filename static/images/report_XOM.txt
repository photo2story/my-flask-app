## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), a leading international oil and gas corporation, has shown a cumulative return of 75.18% compared to the S&P 500's (VOO) 115.96% over the analyzed period. This represents a current lag of -40.8%, placing it at the 39.6th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (-98.6% to 47.2%).  The company's performance has underperformed the broader market significantly.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $105.76
* **5-day Moving Average:** $106.29
* **20-day Moving Average:** $110.20
* **60-day Moving Average:** $116.91

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 10.77 (Extremely oversold, indicating potential for a bounce but also high risk)
* **PPO:** -0.18 (Negative, confirming the downtrend)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.4 (+) (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** 2.6% (Long-term expected return exceeding the S&P 500 by 2.6%,  assuming a long-term (2+ years) buy-and-hold strategy).  Given the current price of $105.76 and its position below its moving averages and extremely low RSI, this 2.6% long term expected return may not be sufficient to overcome the currently high risk.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

XOM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, currently trading below its key moving averages, and showing an extremely oversold RSI. While recent earnings have shown some positive surprises, the overall trend is unclear. The projected long-term return of 2.6% above the S&P 500 needs to be carefully considered against the current risk, given the negative market sentiment reflected in the technical indicators.  Further investigation into the recent news and market outlook is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The extremely low RSI suggests a potential for a bounce, but given the long-term underperformance relative to the market, caution is warranted.  A deeper dive into the drivers of the recent price movement is necessary.
