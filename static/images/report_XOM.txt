## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), a major integrated oil and gas company, has shown a cumulative return of 101.54% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 124.78%.  This represents a lag of -23.24%.  The relative divergence of -23.24% places XOM at the 56.18th percentile of its historical divergence range (max: 39.67%, min: -103.88%). This suggests that while XOM has performed well, it has underperformed the S&P 500 relative to its historical performance against the index.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided alpha/beta data reveals fluctuating performance relative to the market (beta). While periods of outperformance exist (high positive alpha), particularly recently, other periods show significant underperformance (negative alpha), possibly tied to market conditions impacting the energy sector.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values across several periods highlight the volatility inherent in this sector.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $120.31 (Last Market: $120.33)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $120.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $118.57
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $117.23

The price is currently trading above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Divergence:**

* **RSI (65.48):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70), suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.15):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (0.33):**  Positive divergence suggests a strengthening uptrend, contrary to the RSI's suggestion of overbought conditions.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The projected long-term (2+ years) return relative to the S&P 500 is currently estimated at 0%. This requires further analysis. Given the current high energy prices and potential for future growth, this figure might require a more in-depth reassessment.  A 0% expected return implies only keeping pace with the S&P 500 long-term, which doesn't account for potential energy sector specific shifts.

**4. Recent Earnings & Outlook:**

The recent earnings per share (EPS) have been generally above expectations, although the latest report shows a slight miss.  However, given the inherent volatility in oil prices and the global energy market, this must be analyzed within the wider context of the sector.  The companyâ€™s ability to consistently exceed expectations needs to be considered.

**7. Overall Summary:**

XOM has demonstrated strong recent performance, but this must be viewed in the context of its historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Current technical indicators present a mixed signal, with price strength countered by an approaching overbought RSI. While recent earnings have largely exceeded expectations, the volatility of the energy sector and the potential for future market shifts require careful consideration.  A comprehensive analysis requires up-to-date news and analyst opinions to fully assess the current market outlook and potential risks and rewards. The 0% expected return requires deeper investigation.  Before making any investment decisions, consult with a financial advisor.
