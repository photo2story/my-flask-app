**6. Overall Analysis:**

XOM's recent performance is concerning.  While the company shows strong revenue and profitability, its stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.

Before considering a long-term investment, further analysis is needed to understand the reasons for the underperformance and the sustainability of its current financial performance.  The recent sharp price drop requires careful consideration.  Investigating the reasons behind the equity drop and fluctuating ROE is crucial.  A thorough due diligence process is recommended before making any investment decisions.
