**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The cumulative return of XOM (91.69%) lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) (104.98%) by 13.3 percentage points.

The alpha fluctuates significantly, suggesting inconsistent outperformance relative to the market.  The beta values are generally above 0 and vary, indicating some sensitivity to market movements.  The substantial change in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over time reflects the energy sector's volatility and influence of external factors.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

XOM's performance is a mixed bag. While its recent performance has shown strength with high revenue and profit margins and a positive PPO, the RSI suggests a potential near-term correction.  The company's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been inconsistent, with periods of both outperformance and underperformance. The substantial increase in equity and generally strong ROE points to a financially healthy company.  However, the inconsistent earnings and mixed technical signals necessitate a cautious approach.  Further in-depth fundamental analysis, including a thorough examination of the company's future growth prospects and risks within the volatile energy sector, is crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.  The 3% expected long-term outperformance should be viewed with caution, given the inherent uncertainties in long-term market predictions.
