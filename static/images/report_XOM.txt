## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**0) Overview:** Exxon Mobil Corp is one of the world's largest publicly traded international oil and gas companies.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

XOM's cumulative return is 77.78%, significantly lower than the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 119.91%.  The difference is -42.1%, placing it at the 38.8th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (where 100% represents the maximum historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500). This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market index.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (beta) and varying levels of alpha (outperformance relative to the market, adjusted for risk) over different time periods.  While some periods show positive alpha, others demonstrate significant negative alpha, suggesting volatility in its outperformance. The significant shifts in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) highlight the impact of market conditions and the energy sector's cyclical nature on XOM's performance. Notably, the high CAGR of 106% from 2020-2022 reflects the surge in oil prices during that period.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $106.83
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $108.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $109.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $112.76

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The recent price drop (-$2.50 from the previous close) reinforces this.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (50.76):**  Near the neutral level (50), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (-0.0268):** Negative, suggesting a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Divergence:**  A decrease in relative strength (-0.5) over the last 20 days points towards short-term bearish pressure. The significant price drop of -$2.50 reflects this downward pressure.  

The expected return of 4.8% represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment. This suggests a potential positive alpha over the longer term, despite the current underperformance.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some misses against expectations, particularly in the most recent quarter (2025-01-31).  While there have been some beats, the overall trend suggests some potential challenges in meeting projected earnings.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind these variances.

**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable, fluctuating around $88B in recent quarters.  Profit margins have been relatively consistent, though they experienced a dip in the Q4 2023 and a subsequent recovery. Equity and ROE (Return on Equity) show some volatility and a recent decline, potentially indicating adjustments in capital allocation or changing market conditions.



| Quarter     | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin | Equity (B) | ROE  |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|------|
| 2024-09-30  | $87.79       | 23.23%         | $268.59     | 3.21% |
| 2024-06-30  | $89.99       | 22.44%         | $268.40     | 3.44% |
| 2024-03-31  | $80.41       | 23.51%         | $205.25     | 4.00% |
| 2023-12-31  | $81.69       | 21.67%         | $204.80     | 3.73% |
| 2023-09-30  | $88.57       | 25.27%         | $199.70     | 4.54% |


**6) Conclusion:**

XOM has shown significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the recent past, although periods of strong outperformance have also been observed.  While the recent price movement shows bearish signs, technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment.  Earnings have shown some inconsistency in meeting expectations, and financial data reveals some volatility in profitability and capital metrics.   The projected long-term (2+ years) expected return of 4.8% suggests potential for outperformance over the S&P 500, but this needs to be considered in the context of the energy sector's volatility and the uncertainty surrounding future oil prices and regulatory changes. A comprehensive investment decision requires further in-depth analysis including qualitative factors beyond the provided data.
