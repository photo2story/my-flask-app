The difference is -44.4%, placing it at the 37.2nd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $111.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $117.67

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (13.04):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce back. However, this alone is not a strong buy signal.
* **PPO (-0.53):**  Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (-1.6):** Shows a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return is 0%, suggesting no significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is anticipated over the long term (2+ years).  Given the current price being below the moving averages and the negative PPO, this low expected return is understandable.  A 0% expected return suggests the market is pricing in no significant outperformance in the future.  There is no information on potential volatility affecting the expected return.
