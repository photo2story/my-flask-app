## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), one of the world's largest integrated oil and gas companies, shows a cumulative return significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While recent earnings have been strong and financial indicators show profitability, technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition.  Long-term investment may yield returns comparable to the S&P 500, but further analysis is warranted.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **Company Overview:** Exxon Mobil Corp is a multinational energy corporation engaged in exploration, production, refining, transportation, and marketing of petroleum and petrochemical products.

* **Cumulative Returns:**
    * XOM: 47.20%
    * VOO (S&P 500): 76.31%
    * **Difference:** -29.1%  (Relative Divergence: 55.6% indicating performance is towards the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500)

* **Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows fluctuating alpha (ranging from -0.5 to 0.7) and relatively stable beta (around 0.2-0.3), suggesting varied outperformance compared to the market and moderate sensitivity to market movements across different periods.  The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over time is notable.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $108.30
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $105.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $109.39
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $109.72

The price is slightly below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential short-term bearish pressure.  The recent price change of $2.80 (2.66%) from the previous close suggests a modest upward correction.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.98 (Potentially oversold, below 40)
* **PPO:** -0.0719 (Bearish signal)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +5.9% (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -4.5% (Expected to underperform S&P 500 over the long term)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO, combined with the negative expected return, suggest potential further downside, although the recent price increase and positive relative strength change might indicate a temporary rebound.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Recent earnings have been mixed, with some quarters exceeding expectations and others falling short.  Overall, a trend of slightly lower than expected EPS in recent quarters is observed.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, fluctuating around $80-$90 Billion. Profit margins are consistently high, above 20%, indicating strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has seen significant increase in recent quarters, while ROE has fluctuated but generally remains above 3%.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

XOM has demonstrated strong financial performance in terms of revenue and profit margins, with a relatively high return on equity.  However, its cumulative return significantly lags the S&P 500, suggesting underperformance compared to the broader market. Technical indicators point towards an oversold condition but also recent short-term bullish momentum.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further investigation, potentially requiring analysis of industry outlook, competitive landscape, and specific company-level risks.  While the company's financial health appears strong, investment decisions should consider the risk-reward profile carefully, taking into account the current market environment and individual investment goals.  More thorough fundamental analysis, along with a longer-term perspective, is recommended before making any investment decision.
