## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation.  Over the period analyzed, XOM's cumulative return (80.82%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (122.16%).  The difference is -41.3%, placing it at the 39.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max range). This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta data show considerable volatility in XOM's performance relative to the market (Beta ~0.1 suggesting low correlation with the market). While some periods show strong positive returns (e.g., 2020-2022), others exhibit significant negative returns (e.g., 2018-2020).  The consistently low alpha suggests that XOM has not consistently outperformed the market after adjusting for risk.  Note the considerable variation in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the period.

* **Closing Price:** $108.66
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $110.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $108.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $113.37

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent downward trend.  However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a more substantial decline over the longer term.  The recent price change (-$1.35) reflects a small drop from the previous close.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.52 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.39 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -7.0% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 4.3% (Long-term expected return exceeding the S&P 500)

The price action shows a recent small decline, aligning with the slightly negative relative divergence indicator.  However, the positive PPO suggests underlying bullish momentum. The long-term expected return is positive, but this should be considered in the context of the overall market risk and the company's inherent volatility.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

XOM's performance has been mixed. While it has shown periods of strong growth, it has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed timeframe.  The company's financial statements show relatively stable revenue and profitability, but with some fluctuations.  Technical indicators present a somewhat ambiguous picture, with some suggesting bullish momentum and others indicating a recent bearish trend. The projected long-term outperformance of the S&P 500 should be viewed cautiously considering the inherent volatility and underperformance observed relative to the market benchmarks. Further investigation into sector-specific factors and future oil price projections would be necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.
