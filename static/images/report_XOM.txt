**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO) Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** Exxon Mobil Corp is an integrated oil and gas company involved in exploration, production, refining, and marketing of petroleum products.
*   **Divergence:** XOM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The current divergence is -61.9% (VOO has returned 61.9% more than XOM cumulatively).
*   **Relative Divergence:** 26.2 (This indicates that the current divergence is relatively closer to the minimum divergence observed in the past data, suggesting XOM is performing closer to its worst-case scenario compared to VOO within the analyzed period).
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**
    *   The Alpha is generally negative, indicating underperformance relative to the market (S&P 500), except in the 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 periods.
    *   The Beta values range from 0.5 to 1.1, indicating XOM's price is generally less volatile than the market.  A Beta of 1.1 in 2018-2021 and 2019-2021 suggests slightly *higher* volatility than the market during those periods, while 0.5 in recent periods indicates lower volatility.
    *   CAGR varies significantly over the periods, with large negative returns in 2016-2018, 2017-2019 and 2018-2020, and very strong positive returns in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023.
    *   MDD (Maximum Drawdown) shows the potential downside risk. The MDD is high in the 2018-2020 and 2019-2021 periods, reflecting significant market downturns.
    *   Market Cap increased from 2016-2017 to 2025-2026 except for a drop in 2018-2020.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   The stock price is above all three simple moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day).  This suggests a short-term upward trend.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA, reinforcing the upward trend indication.
*   The recent market movement (price increasing from $122.91 to $124.61) confirms this upward momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **MRI of 0.7 (Medium Investment):** Suggests a moderate level of risk associated with investing in XOM.
*   **RSI of 62.01:** Indicates the stock is nearing overbought territory (above 70 is generally considered overbought).
*   **PPO of 0.16:** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) measures the momentum of a stock. 0.16 shows the price is slightly over its moving averages, supporting the short-term upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)" indicates that the investment algorithm recommends to buy the stock.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change of +5.9 (+):** Confirms the short-term upward movement ("단기상승" - short-term rise).
*   **Expected Return of -57.8%:** This is a *very* negative signal. It suggests that, based on current models, XOM is expected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the next two years.  This is a critical point of concern.  This high negative value could be because XOM rose dramatically in the past (due to high oil prices), making the reference point high and thus leading to a negative expected future return, so you need to check if this is true.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed Headlines:** The news headlines present a mixed picture:
    *   **Negative:** "Sell Exxon Stock Immediately" is a strong sell recommendation.
    *   **Positive:** "Exxon Mobil Stock: Buy Time Extended" is a buy recommendation.
    *   **Neutral/Informative:** The other headlines discuss Venezuela operations, integrated business model, and analyst perspectives, providing context but not necessarily a strong buy or sell signal.
*   **Key Takeaway:** The conflicting news highlights the uncertainty surrounding XOM's future. The Venezuela operation, lower oil prices, and analyst disagreements add to the complexity.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** The analyst consensus is a "Buy" (2.30 on a scale of 1-5).
*   **Target Price:** The average target price is $131.36, suggesting potential upside from the current price of $124.61.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Summary:** XOM is currently showing short-term upward momentum, supported by its price relative to its moving averages, RSI, PPO, and recent relative divergence change, which is contrary to the very negative expected return (-57.8%). Analyst consensus is "Buy" with an average target price above the current price.
*   **Key Concerns:**
    *   **Significant Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** XOM has drastically underperformed the S&P 500, and the expected return suggests this trend will continue.
    *   **Conflicting News Headlines:** The mixed news signals highlight the uncertainty surrounding the stock. The expected return of -57.8% shows a pessimistic outlook for XOM in the long term, and the recent news indicates that the news supports this outlook.
    *   **RSI Nearing Overbought:** A high RSI (approaching 70) may signal that the recent upward movement is unsustainable.

*   **Recommendations:**
    *   **Exercise Caution:** Given the significant underperformance, negative expected return, and conflicting news, investors should exercise caution before investing in XOM.
    *   **Due Diligence:** Thoroughly research the factors contributing to the negative expected return, including oil price forecasts, geopolitical risks (Venezuela), and XOM's long-term strategy.
    *   **Monitor Closely:** If already invested, closely monitor XOM's performance, news updates, and analyst ratings. The negative expected return should be a significant concern.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:** Explore other investment opportunities with more favorable growth prospects and expected returns.
*   **Additional Notes:** The large previous change (1.38) indicates that the fluctuation issues should be monitored.

In conclusion, while there are some positive short-term signals, the overall analysis paints a cautious picture for XOM due to significant underperformance and negative expectations. Further investigation and careful monitoring are warranted.
