A long-term investment decision requires careful consideration of the company's long-term growth prospects, future oil prices, and the overall market conditions.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before investing.  The current undervaluation relative to the S&P 500 might present an opportunity, but the risks need to be carefully assessed.
