## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), a major integrated oil and gas company, has shown a cumulative return of 76.39% over the period analyzed, significantly lagging the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 120.68%.  The difference represents a -44.3% underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided relative divergence metric of 37.2% indicates this underperformance is towards the lower end of its historical range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market. While 2020-2022 shows strong positive alpha,  other periods indicate underperformance (negative alpha). Beta consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting low correlation with market movements. Market capitalization fluctuated significantly over the years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $106.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $106.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $111.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $117.44

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 9.56 –  Indicates the stock is significantly oversold.
* **PPO:** -0.38 – Suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -4.2% - Shows a recent short-term decline.

The relatively low price of $106.49, coupled with oversold RSI and negative PPO, doesn't suggest an imminent sharp rebound.  A sustained rally would be needed to counter these indicators.  The expected return of 2.6% represents a projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming consistent  accumulation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some variability in EPS performance. While there were instances of exceeding expectations (e.g., 2024-08-02 and 2024-11-01), there were also instances of missing expectations (e.g., 2024-04-26 and 2023-10-27).  There's no clear trend of consistent growth or decline in EPS.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains high.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are generally healthy, though they show some variability quarter to quarter, potentially indicating sensitivity to commodity prices and operational efficiencies.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity shows significant increase in Q2 2024, possibly due to factors not explicitly provided. ROE is relatively stable but displays considerable volatility and is not consistently growing.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **News:** No recent earnings news was provided within the prompt, therefore no analysis can be presented.
* **Market Outlook:**  Not provided.
* **Analyst Opinions:** Not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

XOM currently shows signs of underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While the long-term expected return suggests a potential positive alpha, short-term technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) point towards a bearish sentiment. Earnings reports demonstrate inconsistent performance against expectations, with no strong upward or downward trends evident.  Financial data indicates healthy revenue and profit margins, but profitability metrics (ROE) demonstrate volatility.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits a complete assessment.  Further investigation into the factors contributing to revenue fluctuations and the volatility in ROE would be necessary for a more comprehensive analysis.

**8. Recommendation:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is recommended. While the long-term outlook might be positive based on the expected return, the short-term technical indicators and the inconsistent earnings performance suggest a wait-and-see approach before making significant investment decisions.  More information regarding market outlook and analyst opinions is needed to make a well-informed decision.  Close monitoring of upcoming news, especially earnings reports and any related announcements are essential.
