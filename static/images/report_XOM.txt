    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   Very negative Alpha and Expected Return, indicating concerns about long-term investment.
    *   High Maximum Drawdown suggests substantial risk.
    *   The significant divergence from S&P 500 should be a cause for concern.
    *   Recent drop in Price.
    *   The calculated beta of 0 may indicate a problem with the data.

*   **Recommendation:**

    *   Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is warranted. While some short-term indicators are positive, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the extremely negative expected return should be carefully considered.
    *   It is recommended to further investigate the reasons for the underperformance and the basis for the negative expected return before making any investment decisions.
    *   The high MDD indicates that there is high risk to the investment.

In summary, while there are some short-term positive signals, the long-term outlook for XOM, relative to the broader market, appears concerning based on this data. The high MDD suggests that the stock carries a higher degree of risk compared to the market.
