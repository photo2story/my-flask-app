The recent analyst upgrade and raised price target provide positive signals, but the negative long-term expected return and high historical MDD values should be considered. Investors should weigh the potential for short-term gains against the risk of long-term underperformance compared to the broader market. Investors might want to consider a diversified portfolio.
