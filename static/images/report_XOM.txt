## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) is one of the world's largest integrated oil and gas companies.  This report analyzes XOM's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and provides an outlook based on available data.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

* **XOM Cumulative Return:** 77.78%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 119.91%
* **Return Difference:** -42.13%  (XOM underperformed VOO by 42.13%).
* **Relative Underperformance:** 38.8% (This indicates XOM's underperformance is in the higher percentile of its historical range of under/outperformance against the VOO).

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows a volatile relationship between XOM's performance and the overall market (as reflected in the S&P 500).  While periods of significant outperformance (e.g., 2020-2022) exist, there are also periods of underperformance and even negative returns.  The considerable fluctuation in Alpha suggests that XOM's performance is not consistently predictable based on market movements alone. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally increased over the period, though it fluctuates.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $106.83
* **Last Market Price:** $106.96
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $108.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $109.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $112.76

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The small increase in the last market price compared to the previous close ($0.13) indicates minimal recent price volatility.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.76 (Near the neutral level, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** -0.0268 (Slightly negative, indicating bearish momentum but very close to neutral.)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -0.5 (Indicates a recent weakening in relative strength.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 4.8% (This represents the anticipated excess return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.)  The small price increase in the "Last-market" data does not significantly alter this long-term outlook.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

XOM has shown periods of strong performance but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.  Recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, supported by the moving averages and slightly negative PPO.  However, the RSI is near neutral, and the long-term expected return is positive, suggesting that long-term investors may see a positive return relative to the broader market.  Earnings have been inconsistent, and financial data reflects some volatility in revenue, profit margins, equity, and ROE.  Further investigation into the drivers of this volatility, considering macroeconomic factors and specific industry conditions affecting the energy sector, would be beneficial for a more complete analysis.  The long-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic, contingent on future performance and macroeconomic factors.
