## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Relative Strength:**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), a global energy giant involved in exploration, production, refining, and marketing of petroleum and petrochemical products, has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly.  The cumulative return of XOM (82.59%) lags behind VOO (112.74%) by 30.2 percentage points. The relative strength indicator (-30.2) places it in the 46.9th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests that while XOM has shown growth, it's been less robust than the broader market.

The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance over the years, with periods of strong growth alongside periods of significant decline. This highlights the volatility inherent in the energy sector and XOM's susceptibility to market cycles and commodity price fluctuations.  The consistently low Alpha (around 0.1) suggests that XOM's returns have largely tracked the market, with little outperformance.  The Beta, while varying slightly across periods, generally indicates sensitivity to overall market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the reporting date, XOM's closing price was $109.72. The stock price is currently above its 5-day ($108.25) and 20-day ($107.41) moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it is below its 60-day moving average ($114.35), indicating a potential longer-term bearish trend.  The recent price sits above the 20 day moving average, but slightly under the 60-day. This suggests a current upward trend but potential for downward price movements in the short term

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI (68.35) is approaching overbought territory (generally considered >70), suggesting potential near-term price correction. The PPO (0.59) indicates positive momentum, albeit not extremely strong. The recent relative strength divergence (+5.5) further supports the short-term upward trend. The 20-day relative strength divergence of +5.5 points to increasing positive momentum.   A projected 2.7% expected return from the current price, considering a long-term (2+ years) investment, suggests a possible underperformance compared to the S&P 500's historical average.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data shows a mixed picture. While actual EPS has generally exceeded expectations in several quarters, there are instances of underperformance. The recent trend suggests some potential earnings variability and dependence on external factors influencing oil prices and company performance. Further, the latest reported EPS is under expectations, which is a bearish sign.

|-------------|---------------|--------------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | $87.79       | 23.23             | $268.59     | 3.21    |
| 2024-06-30  | $89.99       | 22.44             | $268.40     | 3.44    |
| 2024-03-31  | $80.41       | 23.51             | $205.25     | 4.00    |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

XOM's recent performance has been mixed. While it exhibits short-term positive momentum, its longer-term performance lags behind the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest potential for near-term corrections despite some positive momentum.  Earnings show variability, and the recent decline in profitability paired with a decreasing ROE are concerning.  Overall, while XOM offers a potential long-term investment, caution is warranted given its relative underperformance and the mixed signals from recent financial results and technical analysis. A thorough review of macroeconomic conditions affecting the energy sector is crucial before making any investment decision.
