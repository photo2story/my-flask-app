## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation.  Over the period analyzed, XOM's cumulative return (82.34%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return (121.09%). The difference is -38.7%, placing it at the 41.1th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates that XOM underperformed the market benchmark considerably during this period.

The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance relative to the S&P 500, with periods of outperformance and significant underperformance (e.g., -43% CAGR from 2018-2020). The consistent Beta of approximately 0.1 suggests a low correlation with the overall market. A low alpha consistently near 0.1 across various periods indicates a slightly above-market return after accounting for market risk, but not substantial.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $109.57
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $109.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $109.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $112.88

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent minor upward trend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term rally within a longer-term downtrend. The price increased by $0.83 (0.76%) from the previous close, representing a minor positive change.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.94 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning slightly towards neutral territory.
* **PPO:** 0.13 – A positive PPO value indicates that the short-term momentum is slightly stronger than the long-term momentum.  
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +0.6 – This indicates a recent short-term upward trend relative to the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 4.3% – This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.

The recent price increase of $0.83 is not significant enough to be considered a sharp upward movement.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |

| 2024-08-02 | 2.14     | 2.01         | +0.13      |

| 2023-10-27 | 2.27     | 2.37         | -0.10      |

Exxon Mobil has consistently exceeded or met expectations in recent quarters, except for Q2 2024.  While there's some fluctuation, the overall trend shows a relatively strong EPS performance.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable with slight fluctuations. Profit margins have been strong and generally consistent, though showing a recent slight decrease.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has seen fluctuations, especially a large drop between Q1 and Q2 2024. ROE has also varied, but remains within a relatively stable range.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

XOM has shown mixed performance relative to the S&P 500. While recent earnings have been strong and the technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly positive short-term outlook, the long-term performance compared to the market has been disappointing.  The relatively low beta suggests it's less volatile than the overall market, but the lower-than-market returns raises questions about its long-term investment potential without a considerable shift in market dynamics favoring energy companies. The projected long-term outperformance (4.3%) needs to be considered cautiously given the past underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the drivers of recent earnings and future industry prospects is crucial before making any investment decision.  The significant drop in equity between Q1 and Q2 2024 warrants additional scrutiny.
