2025-12-31 - Analysis Report
Here's a breakdown of the Exxon Mobil (XOM) analysis, incorporating the provided data:

**1) Return Comparison: XOM vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Exxon Mobil Corp is one of the world's largest publicly traded international oil and gas companies.
*   **XOM Cumulative Return:** 25.63%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -79.5 (Relative Divergence: 16.1)

**Analysis:** XOM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The large negative divergence indicates a considerable difference in cumulative returns, with XOM lagging far behind VOO. The relative divergence of 16.1 suggests that the current divergence is relatively close to the most negative divergence seen in the historical data.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

The provided table shows the following trends over the various 3-year periods:

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Highly volatile, ranging from -34% to +48%, indicating inconsistent growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, between 65.6% and 81.8%, suggesting significant potential losses.
*   **Alpha:** Primarily negative, indicating underperformance compared to its benchmark. Positive Alpha only during 2020-2022 and 2021-2023.
*   **Beta:** Fluctuates, suggesting variable sensitivity to market movements. Generally, closer to 0 indicates a less market-sensitive investment.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** Demonstrates volatility, falling as low as 175.7B and reaching highs above 500B.

**Analysis:** Overall, this data suggests XOM has been a volatile and generally underperforming investment compared to the market. The high MDD values indicate a significant risk of capital loss. The negative alpha values, especially in recent periods, highlight the stock's failure to keep pace with market returns. The market capitalization has been growing over time.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 120.99
*   **Previous Close:** 120.53 (Change: +0.38)
*   **5-day SMA:** 119.854
*   **20-day SMA:** 118.0565
*   **60-day SMA:** 116.1088

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently above all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day). This suggests a short-term, mid-term and long-term uptrend. The recent positive change indicates some upward momentum.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 59.24 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.25 (Neutral)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 90% of cash (8 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.3 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -151.3% (Negative long-term outlook vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI and PPO are relatively neutral, not indicating strong overbought or oversold conditions. The hybrid signal recommends a buy. However, the negative recent relative divergence change points to a short-term downward trend. The very negative Expected Return suggests that, based on this analysis, XOM is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

The news headlines paint a mixed picture:

*   **Positive:** Articles highlight XOM as a potentially good long-term investment, hitting new 52-week highs, and being acquired by Apollon Wealth Management.
*   **Negative/Mixed:** Articles mention falling oil prices despite XOM's stock performance and discuss analyst targets, as well as factors to watch.

**Analysis:** The news suggests investor sentiment is mixed. While some see long-term potential, others are wary due to oil price volatility. The acquisition news could be seen as a positive signal. The disparity between XOM's stock price and oil prices warrants further investigation.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean Rating: 2.22)
*   **Target Price:** Average $131.56 (Upside potential from current price)

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating on XOM, and the average target price suggests potential upside. However, the range of target prices ($109 - $158) indicates some uncertainty in their projections.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis Summary:**

*   **Underperformance:** XOM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.
*   **Volatility:** Historical data shows high volatility (MDD) and inconsistent growth (CAGR).
*   **Technical Indicators:** Mixed signals. SMA indicate uptrend, neutral RSI/PPO.
*   **News Sentiment:** Mixed. Positive articles conflict with falling oil prices.
*   **Analyst Opinion:** "Buy" consensus with upside potential, but target prices vary.
*   **Expected Return:** Projected underperformance vs. S&P 500 in the long-term.

**Conclusion:** While XOM is currently experiencing an uptrend and analysts have a positive outlook, the historical underperformance, high volatility, and negative long-term return expectations suggest caution. The divergence from the S&P 500 remains significant. It is crucial to consider the conflicting news headlines and oil price volatility. The large negative expected return should give any investor serious pause. A deeper dive into the reasons behind the divergence between XOM's stock price and oil prices, and a thorough evaluation of the company's future prospects are recommended before making any investment decisions.
