## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation.  Over the observed period, XOM's cumulative return (85.25%) lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (116.43%). The difference is -31.2%, placing it at the 46.2nd percentile of historical divergence relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  This indicates that while XOM has shown positive growth, it has underperformed the broader market significantly during this time frame.

The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance, with some years exhibiting significant growth and others showing losses, highlighting the volatility inherent in the energy sector and its sensitivity to market conditions.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values further emphasize this risk.  The consistently low alpha (around 0.1) suggests that XOM's returns have largely tracked the market, with minimal outperformance.  The beta of approximately 0.1 is unusually low for a large-cap company like XOM and could warrant further investigation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the latest data:

* **Closing Price:** $111.32
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $109.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $107.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $114.09

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (70.60):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.81):** Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):**  A positive change of 4.3 points suggests a recent strengthening of relative performance.
* **Expected Return (2.9%):**  This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) for a buy-and-hold strategy.  The current price of $111.32 is relatively close to these averages and does not suggest a dramatic recent shift either upwards or downwards (no significant evidence of a sharp surge or decline).

**7. Overall Analysis:**

XOM has shown significant growth in certain periods, but its performance has lagged the S&P 500 overall. While recent price action indicates some short-term positive momentum, the long-term trend requires further observation.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction, while the projected long-term expected return shows a modest advantage over the S&P 500.  Earnings have been mixed, and financial data reveals some volatility in key metrics.  A more in-depth analysis of the company's long-term strategy, industry trends, and macroeconomic factors is necessary to form a well-informed investment decision. The unusually low beta value needs further investigation.
