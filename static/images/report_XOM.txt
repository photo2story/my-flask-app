## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

This report analyzes Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), a multinational oil and gas corporation engaged in exploration, production, refining, marketing, and transportation of petroleum products.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

XOM's cumulative return (81.17%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (121.78%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -40.6%, placing it at the 39.7th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates XOM has lagged behind the market benchmark considerably.  The provided alpha consistently around 0.1 suggests minimal outperformance relative to market risk (beta).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $108.47
* **5-day Moving Average:** $111.14
* **20-day Moving Average:** $116.17
* **60-day Moving Average:** $117.99

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (6.11):** Extremely oversold, indicating potential for a rebound but also high risk.
* **PPO (-0.73):** Negative, confirming the bearish trend.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -5.5%, showing recent weakening.

Given the extremely low RSI (6.11), the current price of 108.47 reflects a significant downturn and potentially oversold conditions.  The anticipated return of 0.0% suggests that, even with long-term investment (2+ years), the expected return is not expected to exceed that of the S&P 500. This is consistent with the historical underperformance against the benchmark.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data reveals some volatility in EPS and a mixed performance against expectations:

* **EPS Trend:**  EPS has fluctuated, with a downward trend since February 2024.
* **Beats and Misses:**  The company beat expectations in August and November 2024, but missed in April and October 2023, and February 2024.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows some volatility, but generally remains high. However, there's a slight downward trend in recent quarters.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have fluctuated, with no clear upward or downward trend.  The margin appears to have been higher in Q3 2023 than in other recent quarters.
* **Equity and ROE:** Equity decreased significantly between Q1 2024 and Q2 2024, though it has increased since then. ROE has also seen fluctuation but has trended downwards in recent quarters.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news is provided.  Information regarding market outlook and analyst opinions is missing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

XOM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the overall trend remains bearish.  Recent earnings have shown mixed results compared to expectations. Financial information demonstrates some volatility in key metrics like revenue, profit margin, equity and ROE. The absence of recent news and analyst opinions limits the scope of a comprehensive assessment.  The 0.0% expected return, even with long-term investment, is a significant concern and suggests that alternative investments might offer better potential returns.  Further analysis, incorporating missing data such as recent news, analyst opinions, and revenue growth trends would significantly improve the assessment.


**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, XOM presents a high-risk, potentially high-reward investment opportunity. The extremely low RSI suggests potential for a short-term rebound, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain given the company's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and lack of clear positive trends in its key financial metrics.  More detailed information is required for a more robust analysis and a clearer investment recommendation.
