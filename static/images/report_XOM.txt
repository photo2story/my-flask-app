    *   **Analysis:** XOM significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. The divergence of -80.7% indicates a substantial gap in cumulative returns.

    *   **Analysis:**  The Alpha/Beta table paints a mixed picture. The negative Alpha values in most periods suggest XOM is not generating excess returns compared to the market given its level of risk. The high MDD underscores the volatility and risk associated with investing in XOM. The Beta values, when significantly different from 1, indicate XOM does not move in perfect lockstep with the S&P 500.

The hybrid signal indicates a "buy" recommendation. The negative change in relative divergence indicates a short-term decline compared to the S&P 500.
