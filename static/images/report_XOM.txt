* **5-Day Moving Average:** $104.15
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $110.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $109.77

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price increase of $2.62 from the previous close suggests a potential short-term rebound.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.8 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.61 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +8.3 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -4.6% (The negative expected return is concerning, especially in light of the other technical indicators)

The recent price increase, while potentially positive short term,  needs to be considered in conjunction with the negative expected return and other bearish technical indicators.  Long-term (2+ years) investment may only provide returns slightly below the market average.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

XOM's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been mixed. While recent financial data shows strong revenues and profit margins, the negative expected return and bearish technical indicators (RSI, PPO) raise concerns about short-term prospects.  The mixed earnings results and fluctuating ROE further highlight the uncertainty. Long-term investors should carefully weigh the potential for above-market returns against the current market underperformance and negative expected return.  Further investigation into the reasons for the missed earnings expectations and the recent price increase is recommended before making any investment decisions.
