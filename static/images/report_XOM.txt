**0. Overview:** Exxon Mobil Corp is one of the world's largest publicly traded international oil and gas companies.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

XOM's cumulative return (79.79%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.63%. The difference is -40.8%, placing it at the 39.6th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-98.6% to 47.2%).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $108.43
* **Last Market Price:** $109.45 (a $0.94 increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $108.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $109.30
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $112.09

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. It is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a more pronounced longer-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 42.18 (Slightly below the oversold level of 30, suggesting the stock may be nearing a bottom, but not necessarily a strong buy signal.)
* **PPO:** 0.06 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, although weak.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.5 (Indicates a recent short-term decline.)

The price increase from the previous close shows a minor positive move, not a significant “jump”. The expected return of 5% over the long term (2+ years) represents an expected outperformance of the S&P 500, but this should be considered cautiously given the past volatility and the cyclical nature of the energy sector.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-01-31 | 1.67   | 1.77         | -0.10       |
| 2024-11-01 | 1.92   | 1.88         | +0.04       |
| 2024-08-02 | 2.14   | 2.01         | +0.13       |
| 2024-04-26 | 2.06   | 2.20         | -0.14       |
| 2024-02-02 | 2.48   | 2.21         | +0.27       |

Earnings have been mixed, with some quarters exceeding expectations and others falling short.  There’s no clear trend.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind these variations.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $87.79B   | 23.23%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $89.99B   | 22.44%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $80.41B   | 23.51%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $81.69B   | 21.67%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $88.57B   | 25.27%        |

Revenue is relatively stable, although showing some fluctuation. Profit margins are generally healthy but exhibit some variability, suggesting potential sensitivity to commodity prices and operating costs.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE    |
|---------|------------|--------|
| 2024-09-30 | $268.59B  | 3.21%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $268.40B  | 3.44%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $205.25B  | 4.00%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $204.80B  | 3.73%  |
| 2023-09-30 | $199.70B  | 4.54%  |

Equity has shown a significant increase, but ROE is relatively low and fluctuating. This may be due to increased investment or changes in accounting methods. Further analysis is warranted.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

XOM's performance has lagged the S&P 500 over the long term, although recent years have shown strong gains.  The company's financials indicate healthy revenue and profit margins, but earnings have been inconsistent.  Technical indicators suggest a potential bottoming out but not a strong bullish signal.  Long-term investment might be considered based on the expected return of 5%, provided that one is comfortable with the inherent volatility of the energy sector and recognizes the past underperformance relative to the market.  Before any investment decision, deeper fundamental analysis is strongly recommended, including a thorough assessment of future oil prices and geopolitical risks.
