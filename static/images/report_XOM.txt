2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Exxon Mobil (XOM) based on the provided data:

**1. Return Analysis:**

*   **XOM Overview:** Exxon Mobil Corp is one of the world's largest publicly traded international oil and gas companies.
*   **Cumulative Return:** XOM's cumulative return (29.12%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (91.00%).
*   **Divergence:** The current divergence (-64.5) is substantial. The relative divergence of 23.7 indicates that the current divergence position is near the bottom of its historical fluctuation range. This suggests that the degree of underperformance is more than just the difference.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided table shows a wide range of historical performance.
    *   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, showing positive gains in 2020-2022 (50%) and 2021-2023 (39%), but notable losses in other periods (e.g., 2018-2020: -32%).
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Demonstrates volatility.
    *   **Alpha:**  Inconsistent.  Notably negative Alpha in periods like 2016-2018 (-19%), 2017-2019 (-23%), 2018-2020 (-53%), 2019-2021 (-44%), 2022-2024 (-14%), 2023-2025 (-75%) suggests underperformance relative to its benchmark (S&P 500) adjusted for risk. Positive Alpha indicates outperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Mostly between 0.5 and 1.1.  A Beta close to 1 suggests XOM's price moves similarly to the market (S&P 500), while values below 1 implies XOM is less volatile than the S&P 500.
    *   **Cap (B):**  The company's market capitalization has fluctuated over these periods, growing significantly in recent years.

**Analysis of Return and Alpha/Beta:** XOM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with the majority of periods showing negative Alpha. The Beta values indicate its volatility is generally comparable to, or slightly less than, the market. The wide variations in CAGR and MDD reflect the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry and its sensitivity to macroeconomic factors.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $122.65
*   **Recent Performance:** Last market showed an increase of $1.92.
*   **Moving Averages:** The 5-day SMA (120.724) is above the 20-day SMA (118.465), which is above the 60-day SMA (116.343). This indicates a short-term upward trend.

**Analysis of Stock Price:** The recent increase in stock price, combined with the alignment of the SMAs, suggests a current bullish momentum for XOM.

**3. Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment).
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 59.43. This is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), but is not there yet.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.3338. Indicates a slight bullish momentum, as the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Suggests a 90% buy with the remaining as cash, indicating positive outlook given the MRI.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** +2.6 (+): Short-term increase indicating a short-term rise.
*   **Expected Return:** -66.1%. This is a *significant* projected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.
*   **Price Fluctuation:** The previousClose and change values indicate recent price volatility.

**Analysis of Indicators:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. The RSI indicates strengthening momentum, while the PPO supports a bullish signal. However, the extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting that the model predicts significant underperformance compared to the market (S&P 500) over a longer investment horizon. The fluctuation in price highlights the volatile nature of the stock.

Given the contradictory signals, a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals, future strategies, and the reasons behind the negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions. Also, investigate the headlines that contradict the data trends.
