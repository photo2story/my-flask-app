**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Exxon Mobil Corp is an American multinational oil and gas corporation.  Over the analyzed period, XOM underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by 28.6%, although this underperformance is relatively moderate compared to its historical range of divergence (-98.5% to 47.3%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different time periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others show negative alpha.  The beta fluctuates, suggesting varying sensitivities to market movements.  The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth and performance.  The high CAGR in 2020-2022 (106%) indicates a period of strong growth, potentially driven by the rebound in energy prices.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of $110.15 shows a slight upward trend.  The price is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a relatively positive short-term momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 58.6 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.  The PPO of 0.11 indicates a slightly bullish momentum. The recent 20-day relative divergence increase of 4.1 points towards a short-term upward trend. The price change of $0.63 indicates a modest increase, not a sharp jump. The expected return of 4.4% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 represents a potential advantage for long-term investors.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings per share (EPS) shows some variance compared to expectations.  While some quarters exceeded expectations, others fell short.  This inconsistency warrants further investigation into the underlying factors driving these fluctuations.  Overall, the trend suggests a somewhat volatile but mostly stable earnings performance.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-01-31 | 1.67 | 1.77 |
| 2024-11-01 | 1.92 | 1.88 |
| 2024-08-02 | 2.14 | 2.01 |
| 2024-04-26 | 2.06 | 2.2 |
| 2024-02-02 | 2.48 | 2.21 |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, though it fluctuates slightly quarter to quarter.  Profit margins are generally high and consistent, suggesting good profitability.  Equity has seen a notable increase from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024, followed by a slight decrease in Q4 2024.  Return on Equity (ROE) is positive but shows some volatility, potentially reflecting the energy sector's cyclical nature.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $81.06B | 21.28% |

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Exxon Mobil (XOM) exhibits a mixed performance. While it has shown periods of significant growth and high profitability, its overall return has lagged behind the S&P 500.  The recent price action suggests some positive momentum, supported by technical indicators.  However, the inconsistent earnings performance and variability in alpha and beta warrant further analysis and consideration of market conditions before making investment decisions. The long-term projected outperformance against the S&P 500 warrants attention for long-term investors, but this should be weighed against the inherent risks of the energy sector and the potential for future volatility.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended.
