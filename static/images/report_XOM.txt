2025-12-29 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Exxon Mobil (XOM) based on the data you provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Exxon Mobil Corp is one of the world's largest publicly traded international oil and gas companies.
*   **Return Rate:** XOM's cumulative return is 23.68%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 103.21%.
*   **Divergence:** The current divergence between XOM and VOO is -79.7, with a relative divergence of 15.9. This indicates that XOM's performance is far below VOO's, and the divergence is currently near its historical minimum.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   The Alpha values are largely negative, indicating underperformance relative to the market on a risk-adjusted basis, except for 2020-2022 and 2021-2023. The extremely negative Alphas in recent periods (2023-2025) are concerning.
    *   The Beta values fluctuate around zero, suggesting that XOM's price movement has not closely mirrored the broader market. The 1.2 Beta for 2023-2025 suggests XOM moved more than the market.
    *   CAGR has been volatile, ranging from -34% to 48%.
    *   MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, suggesting significant potential for losses. It means that the maximum value of the stock has dropped to more than 65% in these periods.
    *   Capitalization shows the size of the company to be relatively consistent for the past 10 years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 119.11
*   **Recent Performance:** The stock price decreased slightly, from 119.22 to 119.11 in the last market day.
*   **Moving Averages:** The 5-day SMA (118.52) is above the 20-day SMA (117.54), which is above the 60-day SMA (115.83). This suggests a short-term upward trend, but the proximity of the averages indicates the trend may be weak.

**3) RSI, PPO Index Indicators and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** A score of 1.0 suggests high investment recommendation.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 58.15 is neutral, neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.1122 is slightly positive, which could indicate the stock is starting to trend upwards.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends a 90% buy of available cash, but notes that it is a "safe" choice with a moderate MRI of 0.80.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** A negative divergence change (-2.3) suggests a short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** The very low expected return of -152.2% is extremely concerning and suggests significant downside risk.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   The news headlines present a mixed picture:
    *   Some articles highlight Exxon Mobil's dividend streak and potential attractiveness after a multi-year rally, which are positive.
    *   Others discuss oil's year-end slide and Exxon's 2030 plan, which could be neutral or negative depending on the plan's reception.
    *   Articles about stock holdings being boosted by Cwm LLC and Busey Bank are generally positive.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** The analyst consensus is "Buy" with a mean rating of 2.22, suggesting optimism about the stock's future performance.
*   **Target Price:** The average target price of $131.56 is above the current price, implying potential upside.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

The analysis paints a somewhat contradictory picture of XOM.

*   **Negative Factors:**
    *   **Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500:** This is a major red flag.
    *   **Negative Alpha values in many periods:** Shows XOM underperforms even when considering risk.
    *   **High Maximum Drawdown:** High potential for losses.
    *   **Concerningly low expected return:** -152.2%
    *   **Recent negative divergence:** Suggests short-term downward pressure.
*   **Positive Factors:**
    *   **Analyst Buy rating:** A source of optimism.
    *   **Target price above current price:** Suggests potential upside.
    *   **High Investment Recommendation:** MRI score shows that current investment is recommended.

*   **Neutral Factors:**
    *   **Recent news is mixed:** Some positive, some neutral, some negative.
    *   **RSI is neutral.**
    *   **Hybrid Signal recommends a buy, but characterizes it as "safe."**

*   **Overall Recommendation:** Given the stark underperformance against the S&P 500, negative historical performance (alpha), the alarming expected return, and the mixed news, caution is advised. The positive analyst ratings and target price provide *some* counterweight, but the risks appear to outweigh the potential rewards. A very deep dive into *why* analysts remain bullish despite the data is warranted before making any investment decision. If, after further investigation, the analyst consensus proves accurate, the potential for long-term capital appreciation may exceed the risk.
