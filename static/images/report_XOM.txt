*   **Mixed News:** While dividends and new projects are positive, divestitures, regulatory scrutiny, and the Rosneft situation create uncertainty.
*   **Technical Indicators:**  While recent price action is positive, the recent relative spread change and expected return raise concerns.

Given the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the potential for continued underperformance indicated by the negative expected return, a **cautious approach** is warranted.

*   **Existing Holders:** Consider re-evaluating your position, especially if you are focused on long-term growth.
