## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), a major multinational oil and gas corporation, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Exxon Mobil's cumulative return of 74.76% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return of 114.28% over the analyzed period.  The difference is -39.5%, placing it at the 40.4th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500. This indicates that XOM's performance has lagged behind the broader market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $105.51
* **5-day Moving Average:** $107.85
* **20-day Moving Average:** $114.20
* **60-day Moving Average:** $118.12

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 3.72 (extremely oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.84 (negative momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.6% (short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests that, given the current data, no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term (2+ years) via a buy-and-hold strategy.)

The extremely low RSI indicates the stock is heavily oversold, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible. However, the negative PPO and downward trend confirmed by moving averages suggest caution.  The current price of $105.51, being below the moving averages, does not indicate a significant recent sharp jump or drop.  Further analysis is needed to determine if a sharp rebound is likely.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some volatility in EPS, with some quarters exceeding expectations and others falling short:

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| 2024-11-01 | 1.92   | 1.88         | Beat       |
| 2024-08-02 | 2.14   | 2.01         | Beat       |
| 2024-04-26 | 2.06   | 2.20         | Miss       |
| 2024-02-02 | 2.48   | 2.21         | Beat       |
| 2023-10-27 | 2.27   | 2.37         | Miss       |

There's no clear trend in EPS growth; performance has been inconsistent, with both beats and misses against expectations.  More data is needed to establish a robust trend.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates around $80-90 Billion, showing some inconsistency. Profit margins show variability, fluctuating between 21.67% and 25.27%, indicating some sensitivity to market conditions.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows some increases and decreases, while ROE also shows some variability.  A more complete picture would require analysis over a longer time period.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions. This information was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Exxon Mobil's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While recent earnings have shown some beats, the overall trend is inconsistent. Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a short-term bounce, but the downward price trend and negative momentum indicators raise concerns. Further analysis is needed, including a review of recent news, analyst opinions, and a more comprehensive look at longer-term financial data, to make informed investment decisions.  The current data does not provide strong evidence to support a long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500.
