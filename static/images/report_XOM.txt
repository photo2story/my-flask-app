The Alpha values show mostly negative returns relative to the market benchmark, except for 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods.  The Beta values generally indicate a relatively low sensitivity to market movements (less than 1),  except in the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $111.81
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $110.04

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent small positive change (+$0.24) is not significant enough to indicate a reversal of this trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.46 (Medium to High Risk)
* **RSI:** 31.75 (Suggests oversold conditions, potentially indicating a bounce but not necessarily a sustained uptrend.)
* **PPO:** -1.45 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -9.5% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -22.6% (Significantly lower than the expected return of the S&P 500 over the same period)

The technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook. The low RSI might suggest a short-term bounce, but the negative PPO and significant negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 are cautionary.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

XOM's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500. While the company shows healthy revenue and profitability, several indicators suggest a bearish outlook in the short to medium term.  Technical indicators suggest potential oversold conditions, but the negative expected return and consistent underperformance relative to the market are major concerns.  A long-term (2+ years) investment might be considered only with a high risk tolerance given the projected negative alpha and the current market positioning.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the company's future projections and strategic plans, would be needed before making any investment decisions.  The significant drop in equity from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024 warrants further investigation.
