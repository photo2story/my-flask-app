## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation.  The cumulative return of XOM (97.11%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (128.86%) resulting in a difference of -31.8%.  This places XOM at the 50.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range of maximum and minimum divergence.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $117.66 (Last-market: $117.64)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $119.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $119.18
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $117.67

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term.  However, the 60-day average is almost identical to the closing price indicating potential support at this level.

**3. Technical Indicators and Divergence:**

* **RSI (40.72):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.18):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-2.7):**  Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% suggests no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term (2+ years) based on current information.  Given the negative PPO and negative relative divergence this is a very conservative estimate.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The recent earnings have shown some mixed results. While some quarters surpassed expectations (e.g., 2024-08-02 and 2024-02-02), others fell short (e.g., 2024-04-26 and 2023-10-27). The most recent earnings (2024-11-01) slightly exceeded expectations ($1.92 vs. $1.88). Overall, the earnings trend seems relatively stable but further analysis is needed to determine if the trend will continue.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, with profit margins fluctuating slightly around 23%.  A slight dip is noticeable in Q4 2023 but overall profitability is consistently strong.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown fluctuations but ROE has remained somewhat consistent, though decreased from Q3 2023. Further analysis of the equity fluctuations and any related disclosures would be beneficial.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires accessing recent news articles from sources like Shacknews and Finbold within the last two days.  Please provide access to these articles for a thorough analysis.)*  Without access to recent news, I cannot comment on specific events impacting the stock price.  A lack of recent significant negative news might help explain the relatively stable price near the 60-day average despite the negative technical indicators.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

XOM's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 recently, but it shows a relatively stable financial profile with consistent revenue and profitability. Technical indicators point to potential short-term weakness, but the RSI suggests oversold conditions. The expected return of 0% shows no significant outperformance over the long term is anticipated. However, this depends heavily on future oil prices and the global macroeconomic environment. The recent earnings show some inconsistencies but the most recent slightly exceeded expectations. Further analysis of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial to develop a comprehensive outlook.  The lack of significant negative news in the past two days might explain the stability around the 60-day moving average.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the information provided, a neutral to slightly bearish stance might be warranted in the short term. The relatively low RSI suggests that a short-term bounce is possible but the negative PPO indicates that momentum is still downward.  Long-term investors might consider accumulating XOM shares if they believe in the long-term prospects of the energy sector, but the data doesn't show any indication of outperformance versus the S&P 500.  More detailed fundamental analysis, including examination of the company's future capital expenditures, exploration efforts, and debt management strategies, would provide a clearer outlook on its long-term growth potential.  Further, access to real-time news and analyst reports is crucial for a more complete assessment.
