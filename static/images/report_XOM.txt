**0. Overview:** Exxon Mobil Corp is one of the world's largest integrated energy companies, involved in exploration, production, refining, marketing, and transportation of oil and natural gas.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

XOM's cumulative return is 45.97%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 72.42%.  This results in a current return gap of -26.4%.  The relative divergence of -26.4% sits at the 57.7th percentile of historical divergence, suggesting it's not unusually far below the S&P 500's performance within the observed range (max: 28.9%, min: -101.8%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others demonstrate negative alpha.  The beta generally hovers around 1, indicating a similar level of market volatility.  Significant changes in market capitalization (Cap(B)) are observable, reflecting the company's performance and market conditions.  The high CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 reflect the substantial price increase during this period.  Note that MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values are surprisingly high, indicating significant potential risk.

Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) point towards bearish sentiment, although the relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend.  The high MDD values highlight substantial risk.  Long-term investment decisions should consider the company's fundamentals, the future of the energy sector, and broader market conditions, rather than solely relying on the provided short-term analysis.  Further analysis with more comprehensive data is recommended before making any investment decisions.
