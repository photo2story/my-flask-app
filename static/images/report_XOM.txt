**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta â‰ˆ 0.1 consistently, suggesting low correlation with the overall market) and modest alpha (around 0.1) indicating slightly better returns than the market would predict based on its beta.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

XOM has shown periods of strong performance but underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent earnings have generally been positive, the company's performance remains highly susceptible to oil price fluctuations.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly positive short-term outlook, but the long-term projection requires a more detailed consideration of geopolitical factors affecting the energy sector and overall market conditions.  The expected return of 2.9% above the S&P 500 over the long term is a possibility but carries inherent risk.  A diversified investment strategy should be considered.  More in-depth fundamental analysis and consideration of industry trends are necessary for a complete evaluation.
