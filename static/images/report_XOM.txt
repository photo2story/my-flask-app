**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (beta consistently around 0.1, indicating low correlation to market movements) and a low alpha, suggesting underperformance relative to its risk level.  Noteworthy is the exceptionally high CAGR (106%) in 2020-2022 which is likely attributable to oil price increases during this period. This high return is an outlier and needs to be considered in context with the inconsistent returns in the other periods.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

XOM's performance has been mixed. While it has shown strong growth in certain periods, particularly during the oil price surge of 2020-2022, it has generally underperformed the S&P 500.  Recent earnings have been mostly positive, but the company's overall performance relative to the market needs to be considered. The low Beta indicates low correlation to market movements, making it a relatively stable investment compared to a market tracking ETF, however the low Alpha suggests that this stability hasn't translated into outsized returns.  The expected long-term return is positive but needs to be considered in context with the overall risk profile of the company. Further due diligence and analysis are needed before making any investment decision.
