## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

* **Ticker:** XOM (Exxon Mobil Corp)
* **Company Overview:** Exxon Mobil Corp is one of the world's largest publicly traded international oil and gas companies.
* **Cumulative Return (XOM):** 85.71%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 85.44%
* **Return Difference (XOM - VOO):** 0.27%
* **Relative Divergence:** 67.2% (Indicates XOM's performance is in the upper 67.2 percentile of its historical range relative to VOO).


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

XOM's cumulative return slightly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  However, the relative divergence suggests that while currently slightly above VOO, this outperformance is not exceptionally high compared to its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500.

The alpha/beta analysis shows significant variation in performance across different periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market, indicated by a positive Beta), others show negative alpha, suggesting sensitivity to market conditions. The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in recent years (2020-2024) reflects the positive impact of rising energy prices. However, the high maximum drawdown (MDD) in some periods highlights the inherent risk associated with the energy sector.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Exxon Mobil has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters, particularly in early 2024. However, there's a slight miss in the most recent quarter (2025-01-31). This could be due to several factors including fluctuating oil prices and overall market conditions.  Further analysis is required to determine the sustainability of this trend.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-01-31 | 1.67 | 1.77 | -0.10 |
| 2024-11-01 | 1.92 | 1.88 | +0.04 |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has been relatively stable in recent quarters, with some fluctuations. Profit margins have also been generally consistent, although showing some minor quarter-to-quarter variability.  Equity shows a significant increase between March 2024 and September 2024.  ROE (Return on Equity) is relatively low compared to the profit margin, which could indicate potential areas for improvement in capital efficiency.

| Quarter | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $81.06  | 21.28% |
| 2024-09-30 | $87.79  | 23.23% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

XOM shows a slightly better performance than the S&P 500 over the long term but with significant short-term volatility. The recent earnings have been strong, but the most recent quarter shows a miss compared to expectations. While the long-term expected return is positive relative to the S&P 500, the recent price drop and negative short-term indicators suggest caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price drop and a more in-depth analysis of the company's future prospects and the energy market are necessary before making any investment decisions.  The relatively low ROE compared to profit margins warrants further investigation into capital allocation efficiency.
