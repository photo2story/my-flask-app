This report analyzes Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), a major integrated oil and gas company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Exxon Mobil's cumulative return (77.81%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (117.62%). The difference is -39.8%, placing it at the 40.3rd percentile of its historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a scale where the minimum underperformance is -98.6% and the maximum is 47.2%).  This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market over the analyzed period.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta â‰ˆ 0.1), with periods of both outperformance and significant underperformance. Alpha is consistently low, near 0.1, indicating limited outperformance compared to the benchmark.  The varying CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) underscores this volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $107.74
* **5-day Moving Average:** $107.25
* **20-day Moving Average:** $108.50
* **60-day Moving Average:** $115.85

The price is slightly below its 20-day moving average and considerably below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a downward trend in recent price action.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (34.15):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (0.34):**  Suggests a potential bullish signal, though relatively weak.
* **Relative Strength:** The recent 20-day relative strength change of +1.5% points to short-term upward momentum.  However, the substantial gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average hints at a potentially larger downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2.9%):** This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.  This is a relatively modest expectation, given the current underperformance relative to the benchmark.  The provided data does not account for potential future market shifts or company-specific risks.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data shows some volatility:

* **EPS Trend:** Generally declining from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024.
* **Beats and Misses:**  The company beat EPS expectations in some quarters (2024-11-01, 2024-08-02, 2024-02-02) and missed in others (2024-04-26, 2023-10-27). The consistent pattern is not easily identified.  Further analysis would be needed to understand the contributing factors to this variability.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:** Relatively stable, with slight fluctuations between quarters. No clear upward or downward trend is immediately evident from this limited data.
* **Profit Margin:** Shows some fluctuation, with a peak in Q3 2023 and a recent dip in Q2 2024.
* **Equity:**  Significant drop in equity from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024.  This may reflect a number of business or accounting factors that require further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*No recent news or analyst opinions are provided in the input data.* This information is crucial for a comprehensive assessment and should be obtained from reliable financial news sources.

**7. Summary:**

Exxon Mobil's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While some technical indicators suggest potential short-term upside, the long-term trend seems negative based on the significant divergence from the 60-day moving average.  Recent earnings have been mixed, showing inconsistency in both revenue and profit margins.  The equity position shows a sharp drop which warrants further investigation.  A crucial piece of this analysis is missing:  recent market outlook and news/analyst sentiment. A more complete picture requires additional data on the market context and company-specific news before making a well-informed investment decision.  The low expected return, combined with the underperformance relative to the market, suggests a cautious approach.
