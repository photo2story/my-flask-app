## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation.  Over the period analyzed, XOM's cumulative return (85.50%) lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (120.36%). The difference is -34.9%, placing it at the 43.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates that XOM underperformed the broader market during this time, although its performance was not in the extreme lower tail of historical comparisons.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the S&P 500 across different time periods.  While some years show positive alpha (outperformance), others show significant negative alpha.  The beta consistently hovers around 0.1, indicating low sensitivity to overall market movements.  However, the consistency of the alpha needs further investigation because the provided Cap(B) value seems constant throughout the years which is unrealistic.  More reliable historical data would be necessary for a comprehensive analysis.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $111.47
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $111.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $108.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $113.84

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent stability. However, it is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term downtrend. The recent price drop of -$0.76 (from the previous close)  shows a minor negative change, not substantial enough to indicate a sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.22  (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.83 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -2.9% (Short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 3.4% above the S&P 500. This suggests potential outperformance, but it's crucial to remember that future returns are uncertain.

The slight price drop is consistent with the indicators;  the RSI is approaching overbought, the recent relative strength is negative.  This suggests a potential short-term price correction, rather than a more severe downturn.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 2024-11-01 | 1.92    | 1.88        | +0.04       |
| 2024-08-02 | 2.14    | 2.01        | +0.13       |
| 2024-04-26 | 2.06    | 2.20        | -0.14       |
| 2024-02-02 | 2.48    | 2.21        | +0.27       |
| 2023-10-27 | 2.27    | 2.37        | -0.10       |

Exxon Mobil has generally exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters, although the most recent quarter showed a slight miss. This suggests a degree of consistency in exceeding expectations, which is a positive sign.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

Revenue has been relatively consistent, although there is some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.  Profit margins have also fluctuated but generally remain healthy and high.

**Capital and Profitability:**

Equity has shown some fluctuation, possibly due to buybacks or other capital allocation decisions. Return on Equity (ROE) is generally above 3%, showing decent profitability considering the capital employed.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

XOM has shown mixed performance relative to the S&P 500. While its long-term expected return surpasses the S&P 500, its recent performance has been weaker, and its current valuation is reflected in the technical indicators (RSI approaching overbought levels).  Consistent profitability and occasional exceeding of EPS expectations suggest a resilient company. However, the provided data lacks sufficient depth for a fully comprehensive analysis and lacks critical elements such as dividend yield, which is relevant to such a stock.  Further research, including valuation metrics and industry analysis, is needed before forming a strong investment opinion.  The apparent inconsistencies in the alpha and beta values in the initial table along with a constant market capitalization value warrants further clarification.
