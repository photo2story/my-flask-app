## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

This report analyzes Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), a major integrated oil and gas company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Exxon Mobil's cumulative return of 99.87% lags behind the S&P 500's return of 123.86% over the analyzed period. The difference is -23.99%, placing it at the 55.65th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max range).  This indicates that XOM's underperformance is relatively moderate compared to its historical performance range against the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent Alpha and Beta values across different time periods, indicating varying levels of outperformance (Alpha) and market sensitivity (Beta).  While recent periods (2021-2024) show positive returns and a relatively low Beta, earlier periods show periods of significant underperformance relative to the market.  This highlights the cyclical nature of the energy sector and its sensitivity to commodity prices.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $119.31
* **5-day Moving Average:** $119.84 (slightly above the closing price, suggesting a recent minor downward trend)
* **20-day Moving Average:** $118.51 (below the closing price, suggesting a potentially bullish short-term trend)
* **60-day Moving Average:** $117.15 (significantly below the closing price, reinforcing the potential bullish short-term trend)

The price is above all three moving averages, implying a potentially upward trending price movement.  However, the proximity of the 5-day average suggests a potential for short-term price consolidation or minor correction.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (55.12):**  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The market is relatively neutral.
* **PPO (0.14):** A positive value suggests a bullish momentum, albeit weak.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (0.13):** Shows a positive short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  This indicates that the model anticipates no significant alpha generation over the S&P 500 in the long term (2+ years). This is consistent with the historical data showing periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the benchmark.

Given the closing price of $119.32 is close to the recent highs and the positive short-term trend indicators, there's no significant evidence of an abrupt price surge or drop.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows a mixed picture. While EPS has generally exceeded expectations in recent quarters, there's some variability. The most recent EPS (1.92) was slightly above expectations (1.88), but previous quarters showed both positive and negative surprises.  This suggests potential volatility in future earnings announcements, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in the energy sector.

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable with minor fluctuations, and profit margins vary slightly quarter-to-quarter.  ROE is also variable, indicating fluctuations in profitability relative to shareholder equity.  These fluctuations are typical for commodity-based businesses, sensitive to prices and market conditions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Exxon Mobil's performance has lagged the S&P 500 in the long term, despite showing periods of significant outperformance. Recent positive price momentum and relatively strong earnings suggest a potentially bullish short-term outlook.  However, the long-term outlook remains uncertain, given the cyclical nature of the energy industry and the volatility inherent in oil prices. The expected return of 0.0% against the S&P 500 indicates that long-term investors should expect returns comparable to the market index, without significant outperformance.  Thorough analysis of recent news, analyst sentiment, and geopolitical factors is crucial for informed investment decisions.

**8. Conclusion:**

XOM presents a mixed investment case.  While short-term indicators suggest potential upside, the long-term performance relative to the broader market is less clear.  Potential investors should carefully weigh the short-term positive momentum against the inherent risk and volatility associated with the energy sector and the uncertainty of long-term alpha generation. A diversified investment strategy would likely be preferable to concentrating heavily in this stock.  Further due diligence and consideration of personal risk tolerance is essential.
