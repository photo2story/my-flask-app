## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM), a multinational oil and gas corporation, has shown a cumulative return of 85.12% over the analyzed period.  This lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO), which achieved a cumulative return of 120.91%.  The difference is -35.8%, placing it at the 43rd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 based on provided data.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta consistently near 0.1, indicating low correlation with the market).  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others reveal significant underperformance, particularly during 2018-2020.  The high CAGR of 106% in 2020-2022 is likely due to the oil price surge but was followed by lower returns.  Note that the Alpha values remain consistently close to zero.

* **Closing Price:** $110.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $112.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $116.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $118.09

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 6.37 – Extremely oversold, suggesting potential for a bounce but also highlighting risk.
* **PPO:** -0.64 – Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** -2.2 –  Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% –  This implies no expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment at the current price.  Given the oversold RSI and the significant underperformance against the S&P 500, a re-evaluation of the 0.0% expectation is warranted. A 0% expected return suggests a neutral or possibly slightly negative outlook.  The $110.84 price is not dramatically above or below recent averages; it does not signal a dramatic price shift, but rather continues the downward trend indicated by moving averages.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Exxon Mobil's recent earnings show some variability.  While EPS generally exceeded expectations in earlier quarters (e.g., 2024-02-02 and 2024-08-02),  more recent quarters (2024-04-26 and 2024-11-01) show some misses. There's no clear trend, and variability is observed in the differences between actual and expected EPS.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates but generally remains high, though a slight decline is observed from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are generally strong, ranging from 21.67% to 25.27%, reflecting profitability but exhibiting some volatility.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity shows significant increase from 2023-12-31 to 2024-06-30, followed by a relative decrease, reflecting variability in the company's financial position. ROE follows a similar pattern, indicating variability in the return generated on shareholder equity.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

XOM currently shows signs of underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While some quarters have shown strong earnings and high profit margins, there's a lack of consistent growth. The extremely oversold RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce but doesn't necessarily signal a sustained upward trend.  The negative PPO and relative divergence further reinforce the short-term bearish sentiment.  Long-term investment prospects depend on future oil prices and the company's ability to maintain profitability in a fluctuating market.  The 0% expected return should be viewed cautiously, considering the current market position.  Further investigation into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.  The absence of revenue growth trends and consistent EPS growth patterns warrants further consideration before making any investment decisions.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the data, a long-term investment in XOM requires careful consideration.  The significant underperformance relative to the market, combined with the mixed recent earnings results and the extremely oversold RSI (which could indicate further downside before a potential rebound), suggests a cautious approach.  A wait-and-see strategy, monitoring key factors like oil prices, future earnings reports, and analyst sentiment, is recommended before committing significant capital.  Thorough due diligence, including analysis of industry trends and competitive landscape, is essential before making any investment decision.
