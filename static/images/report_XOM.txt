## Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) is an integrated oil and gas company.  Over the period analyzed, XOM's cumulative return (85.12%) lagged significantly behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return (120.91%), resulting in a difference of -35.8%.  The relative divergence (-35.8%) places it in the 43rd percentile of its historical performance range against the S&P 500.  While this indicates underperformance relative to the broader market, it's important to consider the volatility and sector-specific factors impacting energy stocks. The provided CAGR data shows significant swings in performance year over year, highlighting the cyclical nature of the energy sector.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $110.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $112.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $116.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $118.09

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** -0.64 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.2% (Short-term downward trend)

The extremely low RSI suggests the stock might be due for a rebound, but the negative PPO and downward relative divergence suggest caution. Given the current price of $110.84 is below the moving averages, it does not indicate a rapid rebound or decline, but rather a continuation of the bearish trend.
