2025-12-25 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the Exxon Mobil (XOM) data you provided, followed by a comprehensive analysis:

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **XOM Overview:** Exxon Mobil Corp is an integrated oil and gas company that explores for, produces, and refines crude oil.
*   **XOM Cumulative Return:** 21.17%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -79.7 (Relative Divergence: 15.9)

**Analysis:**  XOM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period assessed, with a substantial negative divergence. The relative divergence of 15.9 suggests this level of underperformance isn't the worst it's been historically within the given data range, but it's far from the best.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta    | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuating, with significant negative periods interspersed with positive growth.
*   **MDD:**  High Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) indicate significant price volatility and potential risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is often negative, suggesting underperformance relative to its benchmark after accounting for risk.  However, in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 the Alpha was positive.
*   **Beta:** Beta varies, trending from negative to positive, indicating changing sensitivity to market movements over time.  A Beta around 1.0 would indicate movement in line with the market.  Less than 1.0 indicates less sensitivity to the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization fluctuates, reflecting the company's changing valuation.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 116.69
*   **Last Market Data:** Price 119.22, Previous Close 119.42, Change -0.17
*   **5-day SMA:** 116.62
*   **20-day SMA:** 116.86
*   **60-day SMA:** 115.47

**Analysis:**  The price is slightly below the 20-day SMA. The 5-day SMA is very close to the current close, so no recent trend can be determined. The 60-day SMA is below both, suggesting a longer-term upward trend, even though there has been a recent short-term pullback. The 'change' is relatively small, indicating no recent sharp price movement.

**3. Indicators Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 54.45
*   **PPO:** -0.164
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (8 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -2.3 (Negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -152.2%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The medium investment recommendation suggests a moderate level of confidence in the current market conditions.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 54.45 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A slightly negative PPO suggests a mild downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests buying, which contrasts with the expected return.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The short-term decline in relative divergence supports the PPO indication of a downtrend.
*   **Expected Return:** The expected return of -152.2% is extremely concerning and suggests analysts have very low confidence in future performance relative to the market.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Oil Price Rebound and Strategic Updates**
*   **2030 Plan, Buybacks, and 2026 Oil Forecasts**
*   **43-Year Dividend Streak**
*   **Buy The Stock When It Is Not Going Anywhere**
*   **Exchange Traded Concepts LLC Grows Stake**
*   **Resilience in a Soft Commodity Pricing Environment**

**Analysis:**

*   The news is a mixed bag. Some articles highlight strategic plans and resilience, while others suggest stagnation ("not going anywhere").
*   The continued dividend streak is a positive sign for income investors.
*   A growing stake by Exchange Traded Concepts could be a bullish signal.
*   Focus on oil price forecasts and 2030 plans show the importance of oil price predictions on stock prices.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.22)
*   **Target Price:** 131.56 (Avg) / 158.00 (High) / 109.00 (Low)

**Analysis:**

*   Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating on the stock, but the target price range is very wide, indicating uncertainty.
*   The average target price of $131.56 represents a potential upside from the current price of $119.22.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Underperformance:** XOM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and this is a key concern.
*   **Volatility:** The high MDD values highlight the stock's volatility.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators give mixed signals, with a neutral RSI, a slightly negative PPO, a short-term decline in divergence, and a "Buy" hybrid signal that is hard to correlate with an expected return of -152%.
*   **News:** The news is a mixed bag, reflecting both positive and negative aspects of the company.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analyst ratings are generally positive, but target prices are not reliable.
*   **Major Red Flag:** The Expected Return (%) of -152.2% is a massive red flag. It contradicts the buy signal and the analyst consensus. This suggests a potentially significant disconnect between current market sentiment and the longer-term outlook for the company, or that analysts are overly optimistic or do not take into account all available information.

**Conclusion:**

While analysts have a buy consensus, the data suggests caution is warranted. The underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high volatility, and, most importantly, the negative expected return are significant concerns. Investors should carefully weigh these factors against any potential upside from strategic plans or positive analyst sentiment before making an investment decision. More investigation is warranted to understand the -152.2% return estimate. This level of negative expectation would suggest that the existing model used to provide the return and risk scores may be invalid, and more research should be done into the underlying data before using it for trading or analysis.
