2026-01-06 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) based on the provided data:

**1. Performance Overview & Divergence:**

*   **Company Overview:** Exxon Mobil Corp is an integrated oil and gas company that explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas, manufactures petroleum products, and transports and sells crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products.
*   **Performance:** XOM's cumulative return (29.12%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (91.00%).
*   **Divergence:** The current divergence of -61.9 indicates a substantial performance gap compared to the S&P 500. The relative divergence of 26.2 suggests that this divergence, while significant, is not at its historical worst within the analyzed period.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table Interpretation:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuates significantly. Periods like 2020-2022 showed strong growth (50.0%), while others experienced losses (e.g., 2018-2020 at -32.0%).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Reflects risk. The period 2018-2020 saw a very high MDD of 50.2%, indicating substantial potential losses during that time.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative for periods prior to 2020-2022, suggesting underperformance relative to its benchmark. The periods 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 saw positive Alpha, indicating outperformance. The most recent periods (2022-2025) show negative Alpha again.
*   **Beta:** Generally hovers around 0.8 to 1.1. A Beta above 1 suggests XOM's price tends to amplify market movements (more volatile than the market). A Beta below 1 suggests less volatility than the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** Has generally increased over the periods, suggesting overall growth in company size, but it's important to note the data doesn't cover the most recent years fully.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Price:** Current price is $125.36, a significant increase from the previous close of $122.65.
*   **Moving Averages:** The 5-day SMA (120.724) is above the 20-day SMA (118.465), which is above the 60-day SMA (116.343). This indicates a recent uptrend.

**3. Indicator Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 suggests a medium investment recommendation based on the MRI.
*   **RSI:** 59.43 is approaching the overbought territory (typically above 70), but is still in a neutral zone.
*   **PPO:** 0.33 indicates that the 20-day EMA is slightly above the 60-day EMA, confirming the uptrend indicated by the SMAs.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Recommends a 90% buy with 0% cash, indicating a bullish stance based on the current analysis. It also suggests a small monthly investment.
*   **Divergence Change:** A recent 5.9 (+): 단기상승 (short-term rise) indicates a recent increase in performance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** A very negative expected return of -57.8% is highly concerning. This suggests the model predicts significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Venezuela Crude Access:** Several articles highlight potential increased access to Venezuelan crude oil, which could impact XOM's operations and profitability. This is a significant external factor.
*   **Market Breakout:** One article suggests XOM is breaking out at the start of the new year, signaling a potential buying opportunity.
*   **Venezuela Geopolitical Risk:** News about U.S. strikes in Venezuela and a potential capture claim for Maduro indicates geopolitical risks that could impact oil markets and XOM.
*   **Oil Market Predictions:** The Motley Fool article suggests keeping an eye on oil market predictions, implying volatility and uncertainty.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** The CNBC article references analyst Jay Woods' view that XOM is a buy.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Leaning towards a "Buy" rating (2.22 on a 1-5 scale).
*   **Target Price:** Average target price of $131.32 suggests potential upside from the current price. However, the wide range ($109-$158) indicates differing opinions.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No information provided on recent rating changes.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

XOM is currently experiencing an uptrend, driven by recent news and potentially increased access to Venezuelan crude. Analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy" rating, and the short-term technical indicators are positive.

However, several points of concern remain:

*   **Long-Term Underperformance:** XOM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the expected return is alarmingly negative. The Alpha analysis highlights periods of underperformance.
*   **Geopolitical Risks:** The situation in Venezuela adds uncertainty and potential volatility to XOM's operations.
*   **Oil Market Volatility:** The overall oil market remains subject to volatility and external factors, as highlighted by the "3 Bold Oil Market Predictions" article.

**Conclusion:**

XOM presents a mixed picture. Recent positive price action and analyst sentiment might entice short-term investors. However, the negative expected return and significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 should give long-term investors pause. The geopolitical risks in Venezuela and oil market uncertainty further complicate the outlook.
