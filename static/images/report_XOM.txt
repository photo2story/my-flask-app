The difference is -33.4%, placing it in the 49.1st percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently low or zero alpha values across the analyzed periods, suggesting the stock's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta).  Beta values are not directly shown; however, the Alpha values suggest that the stock has not significantly outperformed or underperformed the market.  The significant variations in CAGR and MDD across the years reflect the volatility inherent in the energy sector.

The price is slightly below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, and significantly below its 20-day moving average, suggesting a slight downward trend in the short term. The jump from the last market price to the closing price indicates a recent positive price movement.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0%. This suggests that, based on the provided data, no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term in the context of a buy-and-hold strategy. The lack of specific long-term forecasts necessitates this conservative outlook.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Exxon Mobil's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, though not significantly relative to historical context.  Technical indicators suggest a slightly bearish outlook in the short term.  Earnings have been mixed, with some beats and misses against expectations. Financial information reveals some fluctuation in revenue and profitability but demonstrates the company's general financial strength.  Lack of recent news and detailed market outlook prevents a more comprehensive assessment.  The extremely low projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 (0%) suggests that the provided data does not support a strong long-term investment case relative to the market index, at least in the context of the timeframe analyzed.  Further investigation into potential future growth opportunities is required for a more robust assessment.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the data limitations, a definitive investment recommendation cannot be made.  Further research is needed to assess the company's long-term growth prospects, explore the reasons behind the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and better understand the current market outlook for the energy sector before any investment decision is undertaken.
