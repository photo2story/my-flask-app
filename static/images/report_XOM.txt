The projected long-term expected return of -36.6% against the S&P 500 indicates significant underperformance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals some volatility. While some quarters exceeded expectations (e.g., 2024-11-01, 2024-08-02), others fell short (e.g., 2025-01-31, 2024-04-26).  Overall, there is no clear upward or downward trend in EPS performance against expectations.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

XOM has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While financial statements show strong revenue and profit margins, the stock's price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend. The high market risk indicator and negative long-term expected return raise significant concerns.  Further investigation into the reasons for underperformance against the market is warranted before considering investment.  The oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the overall outlook remains bearish based on the provided data.  A long-term investment strategy in XOM, based on the provided data, would appear risky, given the projected underperformance against the S&P 500.
