**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of XOM ($107.37) is below both its 5-day ($106.43) and 20-day ($108.93) moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  It's also below the 60-day moving average ($109.69), indicating a longer-term downtrend. The recent price change (-$0.86) reflects a slight decrease.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 36.49 suggests the stock might be oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. The PPO of 0.10 is a relatively weak signal.  The recent increase in relative divergence (+3.3) hints at a short-term upward trend.  However, the negative expected return of -4.9% for long-term (2+ years) investment relative to the S&P 500 is concerning.  The market risk indicator (MRI) suggests medium risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

XOM's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly, despite relatively strong financial fundamentals.  While some technical indicators (RSI) suggest potential oversold conditions, the negative expected return and inconsistent earnings raise concerns.  The recent price movement indicates a downward trend. Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance relative to the market is needed before making any investment decisions.  The medium risk assessment from MRI should be taken seriously.  A long-term investment strategy should carefully consider the significant underperformance against the benchmark.
