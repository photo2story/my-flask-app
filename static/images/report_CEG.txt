**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Constellation Energy Corp (CEG) is an energy company involved in electricity generation, transmission, and retail sales.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **CEG Cumulative Return:** 245.30%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 38.80%
* **Return Difference:** 206.50% (This represents the difference in cumulative returns between CEG and VOO at the last date of the provided data.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 83.9% (This indicates CEG's performance is significantly higher than the VOO, placing it in the top 84% of its historical performance range relative to VOO.  It does *not* imply it's 83.9% better than VOO in an absolute sense.)


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2022-2024  | 141.0%  | 12.0% | 108.0% | -0.1 | 70.0  |
| 2023-2025  | 207.0%  | 12.0% | 144.0% | 0.0  | 99.3  |

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) indicates strong growth.  A negative Beta in 2022-2024 suggests counter-cyclical performance (performing well even when the market is down), while a Beta of 0.0 in 2023-2025 suggests minimal correlation with the overall market during that period.  The high Alpha values further underscore substantial outperformance compared to a benchmark. The increasing market capitalization indicates growth and investor confidence.  However, note that these are backtested results and may not predict future performance.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $317.30
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $315.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $312.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $269.75

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively close proximity of the 5 and 20-day moving averages to the closing price indicates relatively strong momentum in the short term.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.86 (Approaching overbought territory; potential for a short-term pullback)
* **PPO:** -0.63 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum, though this is relatively weak.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.9 (Positive, suggesting continued short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 23.6% (This represents a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with a long-term investment strategy.  It is important to note that this is an *estimate* and not a guaranteed return.)
* **Price Change:** The recent price increase of $1.86 indicates a short-term positive move. It's not a sharp spike to classify as a "sudden surge."

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-11-04 | 3.83  | $4.77B      |
| 2024-08-06 | 2.58  | $4.41B      |

| 2024-11-04 | 2.27  | $5.31B      | *(Note: This entry appears duplicated.)*

There is a noticeable fluctuation in both EPS and revenue. The most recent quarter (2024-11-04) shows a significant increase in EPS and a slight decrease in revenue. Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind these fluctuations.  The duplicated data needs clarification.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $6.55B   | 28.95%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $5.47B   | 28.09%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.16B   | 20.42%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $5.80B   | 6.14%         |
| 2023-09-30 | $6.11B   | 22.76%        |

Profit margins show fluctuations, with a significant drop in Q4 2023.  Revenue also fluctuates but generally remains strong.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE       |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $12.57B  | 9.55%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $11.43B  | 7.12%     |
| 2024-03-31 | $11.20B  | 7.88%     |
| 2023-12-31 | $10.93B  | -0.34%    |
| 2023-09-30 | $11.67B  | 6.27%     |

Equity has generally increased, and ROE (Return on Equity) shows positive numbers except for a negative value in Q4 2023.  This negative ROE warrants further investigation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

CEG has shown exceptional performance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by its significantly higher cumulative returns and high Alpha values.  The company demonstrates strong revenue and, generally, positive profit margins, though some quarterly variations exist.  However, the negative ROE in Q4 2023 and the fluctuating earnings require further analysis to understand the underlying drivers.  While the recent price action is positive and technical indicators suggest short-term strength, the RSI is nearing overbought territory, hinting at a potential pullback. The long-term outlook, based on the provided expected return, appears promising, but investors should carefully consider the risks involved and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions. The duplicated data point in the earnings section requires clarification.
