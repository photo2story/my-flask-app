## Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**  This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE), a leading clean energy company, based on provided financial data.  We will compare its performance to the S&P 500 (VOO), assess recent price movements, and evaluate key financial indicators.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) is a leading clean energy company focused on electricity generation and energy delivery.

* **Cumulative Return (NEE):** 71.74%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 76.18%
* **Return Difference:** -4.44% (NEE underperformed VOO by 4.44 percentage points)
* **Relative Divergence:** -19.0% (NEE's performance is at the 19th percentile relative to its historical performance compared to VOO, indicating underperformance relative to its historical range).  This means that NEE's current underperformance compared to VOO is relatively low compared to its historical range of under/outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for NEE over various periods, even exceeding 100% in one instance (2019-2021). However, recent years (2021-2025) show negative CAGRs and increased volatility, evidenced by significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures.  Beta values suggest high market sensitivity, especially in more recent years, exceeding 0.5,  meaning price movements tend to be amplified in relation to overall market trends.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 45.0% | 68.2% | 13.0% | 0.0 | 67.4 |
| 2016-2018  | 34.0% | 61.2% | 13.0% | 0.0 | 77.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 74.0% | 61.2% | 40.0% | 0.1 | 109.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 88.0% | 61.4% | 58.0% | 0.2 | 142.9 |
| 2019-2021  | 129.0% | 61.4% | 69.0% | 0.2 | 176.4 |
| 2020-2022  | 43.0% | 66.3% | 34.0% | 0.3 | 161.3 |
| 2021-2023  | -63.0% | 66.3% | -84.0% | 0.5 | 120.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -39.0% | 72.6% | -59.0% | 0.4 | 146.4 |
| 2023-2025  | -63.0% | 72.6% | -77.0% | 0.4 | 136.5 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $66.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $66.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $68.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $69.81

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent 1.02% increase from the previous close might be a temporary rebound.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 39.87 (Approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound)
* **PPO:** -0.28 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.2 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** 186.5% (This is a very high expected return. The basis for this figure needs further clarification and likely requires considering additional risk factors.)  This high expected return should be interpreted cautiously.


The recent price increase (1.02%) might indicate a short-term bounce, but the overall technical indicators suggest caution. The 186.5% expected return is exceptionally high and requires further justification.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |

**5) Financial Information:**

|---------|------------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $50.10B   | 2.40%        |

Equity is relatively stable, while ROE (Return on Equity) varies.  Further investigation into the factors driving ROE fluctuations is needed.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

NEE has shown strong historical growth but recently experienced significant volatility and underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  While some positive indicators like earnings exceeding expectations exist, negative CAGRs, high MDD, and relatively weak recent technical indicators suggest caution.  The extremely high projected long-term return needs substantial additional justification and context.  Before making any investment decisions, a more thorough analysis of the underlying factors contributing to the recent underperformance, and a critical review of the exceptionally high expected return, is necessary.  Consider consulting with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
