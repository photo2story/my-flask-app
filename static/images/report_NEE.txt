## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Stock Review

**0. Overview:** Nextera Energy Inc. is a leading clean energy company focused on electricity generation and distribution.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return (41.58%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 89.44%.  The difference is -47.9%, placing it at the 13th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on provided data (range of -65.5% to 69.4%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results. While CAGR shows strong growth in several periods (reaching 92% between 2019-2021), recent years (2021-2025) show substantial negative returns (-70%, -42%, -27%).  Alpha is positive in recent years, suggesting outperformance relative to the market during those periods *despite* overall negative returns. Beta consistently exceeds 1, indicating higher volatility than the market.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows steady growth.  The consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlights significant periods of risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $70.92
* **Last Market Price:** $70.54 (a decrease of $0.54 or 0.76%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $70.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $71.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $70.22

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4382 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 39.58 (Approaching oversold territory; below 40)
* **PPO:** -0.196 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.8 (Short-term upward trend)

The recent price drop of $0.54 reflects some negative market sentiment.  The combination of a relatively low RSI, negative PPO, and medium market risk indicates caution. The expected return of 29.4% over the long term (2+ years) represents a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this projection needs careful consideration given the recent negative performance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE's performance has been volatile, underperforming the S&P 500 significantly in recent years despite showing periods of strong growth previously.  While recent earnings have generally exceeded expectations, the stock price is currently below its moving averages, and technical indicators suggest caution.  The high Beta underscores the stock's volatility. The projected long-term outperformance needs careful consideration given the recent negative trends.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the sustainability of the high profit margins are crucial before making any investment decisions. A thorough risk assessment is essential, considering the high Maximum Drawdown seen in historical data.
