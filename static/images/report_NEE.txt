NEE shows a mixed performance picture. While the company demonstrates strong fundamentals, including healthy profit margins and a sizable equity base, recent stock performance has lagged the S&P 500.  The high expected return suggests potential for long-term growth, but the currently overbought conditions (RSI) and recent underperformance relative to the market require careful consideration.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price jump and continued monitoring of key financial metrics are crucial before making investment decisions.  The high projected long-term return should be viewed cautiously in light of the recent underperformance.  A thorough analysis of industry trends and competitive landscape is highly recommended.
