## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Stock Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) is a leading clean energy company focused on electric and gas utilities and renewable energy generation.  The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) recently, but shows signs of potential long-term growth, with a high expected return exceeding the S&P 500.  However, recent price action indicates some short-term weakness, and further analysis is warranted.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return (50.29%) lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (56.30%) by approximately 6 percentage points. This places the stock at the 22.3rd percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500, relative to the maximum and minimum historical differences (95.3% and -35%, respectively).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a positive alpha (0.4 for the 2023-2025 period), indicating that NEE has outperformed the market in some periods, exceeding the benchmark return. The beta generally hovers around 0.6 to 1.0, suggesting moderate market sensitivity. However, the significant negative CAGR in the last two periods is a significant concern. The substantial maximum drawdowns (MDD) throughout the analyzed periods also highlights considerable risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE presents a mixed picture. While the long-term expected return is high and the company shows strong profitability and relatively stable revenue, recent price action, negative CAGRs, and high MDDs raise concerns about short-term performance and risk. The conflicting signals from technical indicators and the divergence between the high expected return and recent performance highlight the need for further investigation before making investment decisions.  A thorough analysis of the reasons behind the recent underperformance and the sustainability of the high expected return is crucial.  Investors should consider their risk tolerance and time horizon carefully before investing in NEE.
