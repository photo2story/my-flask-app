## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Stock Report

This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc (NEE), a leading clean energy company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return (71.74%) slightly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 76.18%.  The difference (-4.4%) places it at the 19th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500 (ranging from -31.1% to 109.2%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows significant year-over-year variability in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  While the CAGR has been impressive in several periods (reaching 129% between 2019-2021),  the recent periods (2021-2025) show significant negative returns.  The Beta values, generally above 0, indicate a higher sensitivity to market movements than the overall market.  The steadily increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth over time.  The relatively low alpha values (except for the final years shown) suggest that, historically, the stock's performance wasn't significantly outperforming the market benchmark after accounting for its beta.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $66.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $66.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $68.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $69.81

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price increase of $1.02 (from $65.64) indicates a minor upward bounce, but it's essential to watch for sustained momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 39.87 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.28 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +1.2 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 186.5%  This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon (2+ years). This is a significant projection and requires further examination of the assumptions used to derive this estimate.  The recent price increase does not drastically alter this projection.

| 2024-01-25 | 0.52   | 0.49          | 0.03       |

NEE has generally exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters, except for Q2 2024.  However, the relatively small differences between actual and expected EPS values should be interpreted cautiously without understanding the context.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE shows a mixed picture.  While it boasts strong profitability and high margins, its recent performance relative to the S&P 500 has been weaker, and recent periods show significant negative returns.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition and potential short-term upward movement, but the long-term outlook depends heavily on the validity of the projected 186.5% excess return. The variability in CAGR and high beta suggest considerable market risk.  Further investigation into the underlying drivers of this projected return and a deeper dive into the company's future growth prospects and risk factors are essential before making any investment decisions.  The recent earnings have generally been positive, exceeding expectations in some quarters.  However, the long term performance projection requires much deeper analysis of macro and micro economic factors affecting the clean energy sector in particular, and the general economic conditions that can drive market performance.
