**7. 종합분석 (Overall Analysis)**

NEE has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, as evidenced by the negative return discrepancy and recent negative alpha. The moving averages suggest a possible short-term downward trend. However, the MRI indicates a low-risk environment, and the expected return is very high, suggesting substantial long-term outperformance potential. Recent news indicates increased scrutiny and volatility.  The company has generally met or exceeded EPS expectations, and maintains strong profit margins.  However, the declining ROE trend is something to monitor.

**Recommendation:**

While the recent underperformance and volatility are concerning, the high expected return suggests NEE could be a compelling long-term investment opportunity.  Investors should carefully monitor news and company announcements, particularly regarding regulatory changes and business developments.  Further investigation into the reasons for the declining ROE is warranted.  The recent price increase should also be carefully monitored.
