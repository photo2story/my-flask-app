*   **Beta:** Beta, which measures volatility relative to the market, has been increasing, suggesting NEE has become more correlated with the overall market in recent years.

*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence indicates a short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return (109.3%) suggests significant potential upside if held long-term. However, this should be carefully considered in the context of recent underperformance.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and a mean rating of 1.92. The average target price of $90.69 suggests potential upside from the current price of $80.41. However, the low target price of $56 indicates a significant degree of uncertainty among analysts. The lack of information about recent rating changes makes it harder to assess the current trend in analyst sentiment.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Nextera Energy (NEE) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently. The CAGR has declined sharply, and Alpha has turned strongly negative. The stock is currently trading in a short-term downtrend, although the RSI suggests it is approaching oversold conditions.

While the MRI and the hybrid signal indicate a buy recommendation, these should be viewed with caution considering the negative trends in CAGR and Alpha.

The analyst consensus remains positive with a "Buy" rating, and the average price target suggests potential upside. However, the range of target prices is wide, indicating uncertainty. Recent news is mixed, with positive developments related to AI data centers and EPS targets, but also potential headwinds from a rotation into value stocks and potential negative sentiment surrounding the Exxon project.

**Overall, while the long-term expected return is high, the recent performance and technical indicators suggest caution. Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before investing in NEE.** The positive analyst ratings and potential upsides should be balanced with the observed negative trends and recent underperformance. The AI data center boom could be a potential turning point if Nextera Energy can capitalize on it effectively.
