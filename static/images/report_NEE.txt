Without revenue information for a full analysis of revenue growth trends, complete assessment is limited.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 recently, although technical indicators suggest it might be oversold.  Earnings have shown some volatility, with a mixture of beats and misses relative to expectations.  Financial information shows strong profitability margins but fluctuating ROE and revenue numbers.  The absence of recent news and analyst sentiment makes a comprehensive assessment difficult.  The consistently low Alpha values suggest that the stock has not historically outperformed the market, supporting the current underperformance. More data (especially on revenue trends and recent market sentiment) is crucial for a robust investment decision.
