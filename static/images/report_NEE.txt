**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, showing a negative deviation.  Technical indicators suggest the stock might be oversold, but this should be considered alongside the fact that the overall trend (as seen by the moving averages) is downward. While the company shows high profit margins and growing equity, the fluctuating ROE and mixed EPS performance require deeper analysis.  Missing information regarding recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions limits the scope of a comprehensive assessment.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative alpha and the fluctuations in ROE is necessary before reaching any definitive conclusions about the investment's viability. The lack of a clear upward trend in earnings and recent price action below moving averages caution against aggressive investment strategies. A thorough due diligence process incorporating broader market and industry factors is strongly recommended before making investment decisions.
