## Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) is a leading clean energy company.  The provided data shows NEE's cumulative return at 82.70% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 117.56%.  This represents a difference of -34.9%.  The relative divergence of -12.0% indicates that NEE's performance is below the S&P 500, but within the historical range of its performance relative to the index.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant year-over-year fluctuations, with several years of strong performance followed by recent significant declines.  The consistently near-zero Alpha suggests that NEE's performance closely tracks the market (Beta is quite high, indicating significant market sensitivity),  with little to no outperformance.  The high beta figures throughout the years confirm this observation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $72.49
* **Last Market Price:** $72.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $74.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $77.91

The price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price is minimal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 32.66 - This suggests the stock is in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.31 - This indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +2.4 - Indicates a short-term upward trend.

The provided expected return is 0.0%.  A longer-term (2+ years) buy-and-hold strategy may not yield significant outperformance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data and the historical Alpha values.  The fact that the Last Market Price ($72.91) is slightly higher than the closing price is not a significant jump to indicate a sudden price surge.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals some inconsistencies:

* **EPS vs. Expected EPS:**  While some quarters exceeded expectations (e.g., 2024-04-23, 2024-10-23), others fell short (e.g., 2024-07-24).  Overall, the trend isn't clearly upward or downward.
* **EPS Trend:** EPS shows volatility, and the most recent quarter's EPS is only slightly higher than the previous one.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue has fluctuated but generally shows a positive trend, with the latest quarter showing the highest revenue recorded.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins generally remain high but have fluctuated quarter to quarter.
* **Equity and ROE:**  Equity shows a steady increase, while ROE has shown significant variability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions within the last two days were provided.  To assess the recent market outlook and analyst opinions, additional research is required.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, indicated by a negative relative divergence. While some quarters show strong earnings, others fall short of expectations and the overall trend isn't consistently upward.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is potentially oversold, but bearish momentum is present.  High beta shows high market sensitivity.  The lack of consistent positive alpha suggests that outperformance relative to the market is not guaranteed. Further research is needed to validate the current market outlook and analyst opinions before making any investment decisions.  Long-term investors should carefully consider the risks associated with high market sensitivity and fluctuating earnings before investing.
