The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals interesting trends:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 45.0% | 68.2% | 13.0% | 0.0 | 67.4 |
| 2016-2018  | 34.0% | 61.2% | 13.0% | 0.0 | 77.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 74.0% | 61.2% | 40.0% | 0.1 | 109.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 88.0% | 61.4% | 58.0% | 0.2 | 142.9 |
| 2019-2021  | 129.0% | 61.4% | 69.0% | 0.2 | 176.4 |
| 2020-2022  | 43.0% | 66.3% | 34.0% | 0.3 | 161.3 |
| 2021-2023  | -63.0% | 66.3% | -84.0% | 0.5 | 120.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -39.0% | 72.6% | -59.0% | 0.4 | 146.4 |
| 2023-2025  | -63.0% | 72.6% | -77.0% | 0.4 | 137.2 |


NEE shows periods of strong outperformance (high CAGR and Alpha) followed by significant underperformance.  The Beta, indicating market sensitivity, has generally increased over time.  The large market capitalization (Cap(B)) suggests it's a relatively stable, established company.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $66.64
* **5-day Moving Average:** $66.19
* **20-day Moving Average:** $67.90
* **60-day Moving Average:** $69.65

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend or at least a short-term pullback. The recent price increase (Last-market data indicates a 3.03% increase) might signal a temporary reversal, but further observation is needed.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.92 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.21 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +1.5 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 184.1% (significantly higher than S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years))

The combination of a relatively low RSI, negative PPO, and medium market risk suggests caution. However, the positive short-term momentum and significantly higher expected return suggest a potentially favorable long-term outlook.  The recent 3.03% price increase could be a bounce within a larger downward trend, requiring further analysis.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 예상 EPS | Difference |

Equity has steadily increased.  ROE shows some volatility but generally remains positive, indicating profitability.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

NEE shows a mixed picture. While long-term projections suggest significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, the recent underperformance relative to the market and some negative short-term indicators (RSI, PPO) warrant caution. The company demonstrates consistently high profit margins, but recent revenue and EPS figures show some weakness. A deeper dive into the reasons for the recent underperformance and Q4 2024 revenue decline is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high expected long-term return, however, remains an attractive feature, especially for long-term investors.  Further analysis of industry trends and potential catalysts affecting NEE is crucial.
