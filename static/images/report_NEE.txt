**6) Overall Analysis:**

NEE's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been mixed, with recent underperformance.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, supported by price being below its moving averages and a high market risk indicator. However, the company shows consistently strong profit margins and generally positive EPS surprises.  The high projected long-term expected return warrants further investigation into its underlying assumptions.  The significant volatility and high beta suggest considerable risk associated with this investment.  Further analysis of the macroeconomic factors affecting the clean energy sector is also recommended before making any investment decisions.
