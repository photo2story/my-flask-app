## Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) Stock Review

**0. Overview:**

Nextera Energy Inc. is a leading clean energy company focused on electricity generation and energy delivery.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return (70.29%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (121.84%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -51.6%, placing it at the 4th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results. While CAGR was consistently high between 2015 and 2021,  the significant negative returns in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 indicate volatility and underperformance compared to the market (high beta values during these periods). Alpha values, while positive for many years, are not consistently high, suggesting that the outperformance is not always significant and could be attributed to market factors.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows generally upward trends.

NEE has consistently beaten or met EPS expectations in recent quarters.  However, the data provided lacks the context to fully assess earnings quality and the long-term implications.


| Date       | EPS   | Expected EPS | Beat/Meet/Miss |
|------------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 2025-01-24 | 0.53  | 0.53          | Meet             |
| 2024-10-23 | 1.03  | 0.98          | Beat             |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.96  | 0.98          | Miss             |

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of total revenue and gross profit data significantly limits the ability to perform a comprehensive financial analysis.  This crucial information is necessary to assess the company's financial health and profitability.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NEE has shown periods of strong growth but also significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in recent years, particularly in 2021-2023. While recent earnings have generally met or exceeded expectations, the lack of key financial data and the extremely high projected long-term return (2543%) raise concerns. The current technical indicators suggest an oversold condition and bearish momentum, but this should be interpreted cautiously without more comprehensive financial information. Further investigation into the methodology used to calculate the expected return of 2543% is crucial before drawing any investment conclusions.  The high beta during periods of underperformance suggests significant market sensitivity. A thorough analysis requiring complete financial statements and a deeper understanding of the methodology behind the projected return is necessary for a more informed investment decision.
