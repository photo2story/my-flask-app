Nextera Energy Inc. is a leading clean energy company.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), NEE underperformed significantly over the period reviewed, lagging by 16.55%.  While the relative divergence suggests that this underperformance isn't exceptionally unusual compared to its historical performance against VOO, it's still a notable difference.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different periods.  While some periods exhibited positive alpha (outperformance), others, especially recently (2021-2025), showed negative alpha and high beta, indicating higher risk and volatility.  The significant negative CAGR in recent years (-72%, -39%, -47%) is particularly concerning. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has fluctuated but generally increased.  The high MDD values highlight the significant drawdowns experienced by the stock.

* **20-day Moving Average:** $71.25
* **60-day Moving Average:** $70.18

The stock is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The significant price drop of -$7.25 (-10%) from the previous close is a noteworthy negative event indicating potentially increased volatility and further downward pressure.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693, indicating a high-risk environment.
* **RSI:** 32.04, suggesting the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a bounce.

* **Recent Relative Divergence:** 7.6 (+), implying a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 55.4% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500.  This should be considered with caution given the recent negative performance.  The significant recent price drop warrants further investigation into underlying reasons.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-01-24 | 0.53    | 0.53         | 0          |
| 2024-10-23 | 1.03    | 0.98         | 0.05       |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.96    | 0.98         | -0.02      |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.91    | 0.78         | 0.13       |
| 2024-01-25 | 0.52    | 0.49         | 0.03       |

Generally, EPS has exceeded expectations, especially in the last two quarters (2024-04-23 and 2024-10-23). However, this positive trend needs to be analyzed in the context of the overall market downturn and NEE's significant stock price decline.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $5.38B   | 55.28%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.57B   | 64.35%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $6.88B   | 64.13%        |

Revenue fluctuates, but profit margins remain high.  Recent revenue is lower than the previous year, which may be a contributing factor to the stock's poor performance.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity    | ROE    |
|-------------|-----------|--------|

| 2023-12-31 | $47.47B  | 2.55% |

Equity has steadily increased, but ROE fluctuates.  The lower ROE in recent quarters indicates a decrease in profitability relative to equity.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

NEE has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, despite generally positive earnings.  The high market risk indicator, the bearish technical indicators (RSI and PPO), and the large recent price drop indicate considerable risk.  While the long-term expected return is positive, the current market conditions and recent negative CAGR numbers warrant caution.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons for the recent sharp decline in stock price and the inconsistent performance.  Investors should carefully consider the high volatility and risks before investing.
