## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Stock Review

This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc (NEE), a leading clean energy company focused on electricity generation and distribution.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

NEE's cumulative return is 82.88%, while the S&P 500's is 122.16%.  The difference is -39.3%, indicating NEE underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.  The relative divergence of -39.3% places it in the 9th percentile of the historical range (-52.1% to 90%). This suggests that while NEE underperformed, the magnitude of underperformance isn't exceptionally extreme compared to its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha values consistently show near zero, indicating NEE's returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta). Beta values generally range from 0.679 to 1.474 which shows substantial market sensitivity.  The highly volatile CAGR and MDD figures highlight significant swings in performance across the years analyzed. The very high negative CAGR values in recent years (-81%, -33%, -12%) are of particular concern.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $72.83
* **5-day Moving Average:** $70.43
* **20-day Moving Average:** $70.60
* **60-day Moving Average:** $73.90

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent price increase but potentially a short-term trend reversal or consolidation.  The significant positive change from the previous close ($5.20) indicates a recent rapid upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 53.45. This indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions, suggesting a neutral market sentiment.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.50.  A positive value suggests upward momentum, although the relatively low value indicates this momentum might be weakening.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.6.  This indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 266.2%. This represents a substantial long-term (2+ years) expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 assuming a long-term, consistent investment strategy. The high magnitude of this estimate requires further investigation into the methodology and underlying assumptions.  It could be driven by an exceptionally optimistic future outlook. Given the recent negative CAGR, this high estimate requires scrutiny.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nextera Energy shows strong fundamental performance with consistent revenue growth and high profit margins. However, the stock's recent performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, despite generally positive earnings.  The high expected return requires careful consideration given the recent underperformance.  The significant volatility and the large swings in performance across the provided years are serious concerns.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of the projected long-term return and the reasons for the recent substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  A thorough evaluation of the risk-reward profile is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The recent price surge needs to be interpreted cautiously given the recent negative trend.
