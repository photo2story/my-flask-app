The hybrid signal is very positive. The analyst consensus is a "Buy" with a target price offering upside.

While the technical indicators and analyst sentiment are positive, the recent underperformance, the Q3 earnings miss, and high MDD should be carefully considered. Investors should weigh the potential upside against the downside risks before making an investment decision.
