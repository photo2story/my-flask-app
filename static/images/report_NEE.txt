Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) is a leading clean energy company.  The cumulative return of NEE (86.48%) lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (122.07%) by 35.6 percentage points as of the last data point.  This places its relative divergence at 11.5% based on the provided historical range.  While NEE has shown strong growth, it has underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data reveals significant fluctuation in NEE's performance over different periods, ranging from a high of 108% to a low of -81%. This highlights the volatility inherent in the energy sector, especially within renewable energy. The consistently low Alpha suggests NEE's returns are largely explained by market movements (high Beta).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $73.99
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $74.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $76.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $79.42

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, indicating a downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 37.60 - Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.19 - Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.1% - Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The provided data does not support a specific expected return.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy, while potentially mitigating short-term volatility, cannot guarantee outperformance of the S&P 500 given the historical underperformance and the uncertain nature of future energy markets.  A 0.0% expected return implies that, based on historical performance relative to the S&P 500, there is no statistically significant expected outperformance.

The current price ($73.99) is not significantly far from its moving averages to suggest a dramatic price shift (e.g., sharp rebound or drop) based solely on this data. Further analysis and context are required.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data shows some variability:

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE has demonstrated strong revenue and profitability, showcasing the value of the company. However, its stock performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 over the given period, resulting in a negative alpha. Recent price action suggests a downward trend. Technical indicators (RSI, PPO) point towards an oversold condition, hinting at potential short-term upside, but this should be considered in light of the historical underperformance against the broader market.  The provided financial information doesn't present a conclusive revenue growth picture, requiring further investigation to determine long-term sustainability.  There are no current 2 day news provided.  Further analysis including more recent data, analyst opinions, and market outlook is needed before drawing definitive conclusions about NEE's investment prospects.  The expected return of 0% underscores the need for careful consideration before committing capital, given its past relative underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
