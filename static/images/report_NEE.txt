**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE shows strong profitability and revenue generation. However, recent performance significantly lags the S&P 500.  The high beta indicates substantial market risk.  While earnings have been consistently meeting or exceeding expectations, recent negative CAGR and the projected long-term return of 281.4% need critical evaluation and further investigation to confirm their validity.  The high expected return should be treated with caution and requires detailed justification. The significant negative returns in the 2021-2025 period are a major cause for concern.  Before investing, further research is needed, including a deeper dive into the reasons behind the recent underperformance and the projected long-term outperformance, along with a comprehensive risk assessment.
