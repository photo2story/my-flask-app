The table shows highly variable CAGR, indicating significant volatility.  Alpha values fluctuate, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (Beta).  The substantial negative CAGR in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 is a major concern.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $72.83
* **5-day Moving Average:** $71.16
* **20-day Moving Average:** $69.70
* **60-day Moving Average:** $70.32

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  The significant positive change from the previous close (+4.03) indicates a recent price jump.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 69.21 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.43 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.5% (Short-term upward trend)

The relatively high RSI and positive PPO suggest some bullish momentum, but the RSI nearing overbought levels hints at potential near-term correction. The substantial price change (4.03) suggests a recent sharp increase, potentially a short-term price jump.  The projected long-term (2+ years) expected return of 96.8% is significantly higher than the S&P 500, but requires further analysis to determine its validity.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE has shown significant volatility in recent years, with periods of strong performance and substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While recent earnings have generally been positive,  revenue fluctuation and the recent price jump warrant careful monitoring.  The high long-term expected return should be viewed with caution without further supporting analysis.  The high profit margins are a positive sign, but the declining revenue and variable ROE raise concerns.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price jump and the Q4 2024 revenue decline is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high projected long-term return needs to be carefully evaluated alongside the underlying financial and operational risks.
