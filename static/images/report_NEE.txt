**6) Overall Analysis:**

NEE shows a complex picture. While its recent earnings have been positive and its profit margins remain substantial, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. High beta values indicate substantial volatility. The recent price increase shows short-term upward momentum, but the long-term trend needs further assessment.  A more thorough investigation into the company's future growth prospects, regulatory environment, and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided 20% long-term expected return requires substantial supporting evidence and should be treated with caution.  The provided data is insufficient for definitive conclusions and further detailed analysis is needed.
