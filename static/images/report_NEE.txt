**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |

| 2023-2025  | -14.0%  | 76.1%  | -79.0%  | 0.4   | 173.3  |

**Analysis:** This table presents a mixed picture.

*   **High Growth Periods:** The period from 2017-2021 showed strong growth (CAGR) coupled with significant alpha generation. These periods also had relatively low Maximum Drawdown (MDD) except for 2018-2020.
*   **Recent Underperformance:** More recent periods (2021-2025) have seen negative CAGR, significant negative alpha, and high MDD. This indicates a period of substantial underperformance and increased risk.
*   **Beta:** The Beta has been relatively low, suggesting NEE's price movements have not been strongly correlated with the overall market.
*   **Capitalization:** The company's capitalization has generally increased over the periods, peaking in 2019-2021 and declining somewhat after.

## 2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:

*   **Current Close:** 84.95
*   **Last-Market:** Price: 83.215, Previous Close: 83.39, Change: -0.21
*   **5-day SMA:** 85.391
*   **20-day SMA:** 84.5407
*   **60-day SMA:** 80.8936

**Analysis:** The stock price closed at 84.95, with the last market price slightly lower at 83.215. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which in turn is above the 60-day SMA. This *could* indicate a short-term upward trend, as the more recent prices are higher on average than the longer-term prices. However, the small difference between the SMAs suggests this trend may not be strong or sustained.

## 3. Indicator Analysis:

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 46.09
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.109
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (11 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -2.7 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 56.4%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation based on the market risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 46.09 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, sitting in a neutral zone.
*   **PPO:** A slightly negative PPO (-0.109) indicates that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, further reinforcing some possible short term decline,
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests buying 100% with cash, which is contradictory with the recent news of decline divergence.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change confirms recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The 56.4% expected return over the long term is attractive, but should be considered carefully in the context of the recent underperformance.

**Analysis:** Analysts generally have a "Buy" rating on NEE, and the average target price (91.00) is higher than the current price, suggesting potential upside. However, the wide range of target prices (56.00 to 103.00) indicates uncertainty among analysts.

## 5. Comprehensive Analysis:

NEE has underperformed the S&P 500 recently. The technical indicators present a mixed picture with RSI in neutral zone. The recent news is also mixed, with articles raising concerns about NEE's historical performance offset by the announcement of an investor conference focused on long-term growth. Analyst opinions are generally positive, with a "Buy" consensus and a higher average target price, but a significant range of price targets reflects uncertainty.

**Overall, the current situation suggests caution. While the long-term expected return is attractive and analysts are generally positive, the recent underperformance, negative relative divergence, and critical news articles warrant careful consideration. The investor conference on December 8th could provide valuable insights into the company's plans to address its challenges and capitalize on future opportunities.**
