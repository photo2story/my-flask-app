**6) Overall Conclusion:**

NEE's recent performance has been underwhelming compared to the S&P 500. While the company shows strong revenue and profit margins, its significant underperformance and high negative CAGR in recent years raise concerns. The oversold RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, but the negative PPO and relative strength divergence indicate a bearish short-term trend.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return requires further investigation and validation.  A deeper analysis of the factors driving the recent underperformance is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Careful consideration should be given to the volatility of the stock and the uncertainty surrounding the long-term return projections.
