This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc (NEE), a leading clean energy company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return (78.06%) lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (108.99%) by 30.9%.  This places NEE at the 14.9th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -52.1% and a maximum of 90%).


The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly variable performance over time. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been strong in several periods (reaching 108% between 2019-2021), the more recent years (2021-2025) reveal significant negative returns (-81%, -33%, and -17%).  The Beta is consistently high, indicating significant market sensitivity.  The Alpha, while generally positive, is not consistently high, suggesting that NEE's outperformance relative to the market is not consistently substantial.  Market capitalization has generally increased, but there are fluctuations reflective of the volatile returns.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $70.85
* 5-day Moving Average: $70.38
* 20-day Moving Average: $69.37
* 60-day Moving Average: $70.52

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent minor upward trend.  However, the price is slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating some potential for further correction.  The recent price change shows a decrease of $1.075 from the previous close, reflecting a short-term downward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* RSI: 54.4  (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* PPO: 0.41 (Positive, suggesting a bullish trend)
* Relative Strength Change (20-day): +4.9% (Short-term upward momentum)
* Expected Return (Long-term, vs. S&P 500): 129.8%

The technical indicators suggest a relatively neutral to slightly bullish outlook.  The positive PPO and recent relative strength suggest upward momentum. However, the recent price drop should be considered. The high expected return needs to be viewed in the context of the significant historical volatility evidenced in the Alpha/Beta analysis.  This high expected return indicates a potentially superior return over the long-term compared to the S&P 500, but it must be considered within the context of the substantial risk indicated by the high beta and recent price volatility.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE exhibits strong financial fundamentals with high profit margins and generally increasing equity.  However, the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500 is inconsistent, and recent returns have been negative. The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity. While the long-term expected return is high, it's crucial to acknowledge the substantial risk inherent in the stock's volatility.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in NEE.  Further analysis, including a deeper examination of the drivers of recent negative returns and the sustainability of the high profit margins, is recommended.
