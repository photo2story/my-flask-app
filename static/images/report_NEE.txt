**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return is 52.29%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) achieved 66.36%.  This represents a negative difference of -14.1%, placing it at the 16th percentile of its historical range (-35% to +95.3%).  While underperforming the S&P 500 over this period, the relative underperformance is not extreme compared to its historical volatility.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance over different periods.  While some periods demonstrate significant outperformance (e.g., 2019-2021 with an Alpha of 0.2 and CAGR of 115%), others show significant underperformance, especially recently (2021-2025, with negative CAGR and high Alpha). The Beta consistently remains high (above 0.0), indicating high sensitivity to market movements. Market capitalization has generally increased over the periods analyzed.  The high and inconsistent Alpha suggests periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $65.86
* **20-day Moving Average:** $69.24
* **60-day Moving Average:** $70.01

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price drop of $1.36 (-1.36%) from the previous close indicates short-term bearish momentum.

NEE exhibits a mixed performance. While long-term projections suggest significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, short-term indicators point to a bearish trend.  The company's financial health appears strong, with consistently high profit margins. However, the recent underperformance relative to the market and high market risk (MRI) warrant caution.  A long-term investment strategy might be suitable, despite the current short-term downturn,  but careful monitoring is advised due to the volatility observed.  Further investigation into the drivers behind the recent underperformance is recommended before making any investment decisions.
