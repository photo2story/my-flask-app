**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $72.14
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $70.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $71.54
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $70.23

The price is slightly above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, it is also above its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term overbought condition. The significant price change from the previous close (+2.36) suggests recent market activity which warrants further investigation into the causes.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **MRI:** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.41 (Slightly below neutral; not significantly oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.0107 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum, though very weak)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +5.7% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 20.0% (This is a high expected return and should be considered cautiously.  It needs to be compared to the risk.  This 20% is an excess return relative to the S&P 500)

The recent price increase warrants attention. While the positive PPO and relative divergence suggest short-term upward momentum, the relatively low RSI and medium risk MRI suggest caution. The high expected return, 20% above S&P 500, requires further justification and risk assessment.
