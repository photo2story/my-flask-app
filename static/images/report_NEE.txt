**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE has shown significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the recent past, particularly in 2021-2024, which contrasts with strong performance in prior years. While recent earnings have been generally positive, the negative price trend and market sensitivity (high beta) are concerns.  However, strong profitability, a high projected long-term excess return, and an RSI nearing oversold territory suggest potential for a recovery.  Further analysis, considering factors beyond the provided data, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The long-term outlook, particularly considering the expected return, remains relatively positive, but significant short-term volatility should be expected.
