    *   60-day: 72.7505
*   **Analysis:** The stock price is slightly up in the last session (change of 0.68). However, the price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.

**3. Market Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3324 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 40.74 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** -0.1771 (Below zero, indicating a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_70% Sell 70.0% of holdings" -  This is a strong sell signal, recommending a significant reduction in holdings. The caution is reinforced by the MRI value.

*   **Expected Return:** 2874.1% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

The RSI is approaching oversold levels, which *could* suggest a potential bounce, but it's not a reliable signal on its own.  The PPO confirms the downtrend.  The large "change" of 0.68 reflects the day's volatility, but the overall trend seems negative. The extremely high expected return should be viewed with skepticism and requires careful consideration of the underlying assumptions.

**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

NEE presents a mixed picture. Here's a summary:

*   **Negative Trends:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative Alpha, recent price downtrend (below moving averages), bearish Hybrid Signal, and negative change in relative deviation all point to short-term weakness. The increasing Beta suggests higher market sensitivity.
*   **Positive Factors:** Strong analyst consensus ("Buy"), consistent EPS beats, high profit margins, and a potentially oversold RSI offer some hope for a rebound. The MRI indicating "Low Risk" market could be misinterpreted since it is not company risk factor.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** The analyst target prices are significantly higher than the current price, but some news headlines are cautious, and the Hybrid Signal is strongly bearish.
*   **Financial Health:** The company appears financially sound, with strong revenue and profit margins.

**Conclusion:**

NEE is currently facing significant headwinds, as evidenced by its underperformance and bearish technical indicators. While the company's financials appear healthy and analysts remain largely positive, the short-term outlook is uncertain. The extremely high "expected return" should be critically evaluated for its validity. A cautious approach is warranted, and investors should carefully weigh the conflicting signals before making any decisions. Recent news and analyst reports highlight the divided opinions surrounding the stock.
