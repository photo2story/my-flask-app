**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $67.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $66.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $67.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $69.55

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price increase of $0.95 (from $66.64) indicates a potential short-term rebound, but the overall trend seems to be downward.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.24 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.0247 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.4 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 205.2% (This represents potential S&P 500 outperformance over the long term,  but requires careful consideration given the recent negative performance).  The significant positive expected return should be viewed with caution given the recent negative CAGR and the need for a longer historical data analysis to validate this prediction.

The recent price increase of $0.95 might be a temporary bounce, but it's not enough to override the bearish signals from the moving averages and other indicators.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-04-23 | 0.99    | 0.969         | 0.021      |
| 2025-01-24 | 0.53    | 0.53          | 0          |
| 2024-10-23 | 1.03    | 0.98          | 0.05       |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.96    | 0.98          | -0.02      |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.91    | 0.78          | 0.13       |

Recent earnings have mostly met or exceeded expectations, except for Q3 2024.  However, this data alone doesn't fully explain the recent negative stock performance.  Further analysis of the underlying business factors is needed.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $5.38B    | 55.28%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.57B    | 64.35%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.07B    | 59.61%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.73B    | 59.36%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.88B    | 64.13%        |

Revenue fluctuates, but profit margins remain consistently high, indicating strong profitability.  However, the decrease in revenue in the last quarter (2024-12-31) is notable and needs further investigation.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE       |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $50.10B   | 2.40%     |
| 2024-09-30 | $50.05B   | 3.70%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $49.14B   | 3.30%     |
| 2024-03-31 | $48.64B   | 4.66%     |
| 2023-12-31 | $47.47B   | 2.55%     |

Equity is relatively stable, but ROE shows some variation.  The recent decrease in ROE could be linked to the lower revenue in the last quarter.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 recently, despite strong profitability and generally positive earnings.  The recent price movement suggests a bearish trend, supported by technical indicators. The significant long-term expected return should be approached cautiously considering recent negative performance.  Further investigation is needed to understand the factors driving the recent underperformance, particularly the negative CAGR observed in the most recent years.  A deeper dive into the business fundamentals and macroeconomic conditions affecting the clean energy sector is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.  This report only presents a superficial analysis based on the limited data provided.
