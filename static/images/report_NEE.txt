Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) is a large, publicly traded utility company engaged in clean energy production and distribution.  Over the period analyzed, NEE's cumulative return (106.66%) lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) return of 126.85%.  The difference is -20.19%, placing it at the 20.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates NEE underperformed the S&P 500 during this period, although its relative performance has varied considerably over time (max outperformance: 98.39%, max underperformance: -50.77%).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $77.36 (Last Market: $77.34)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $76.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $77.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $81.09

The price is slightly above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it is below its 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend in the medium term.  The close proximity to the 20-day moving average suggests a relatively stable price environment recently.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.04 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.31 (Positive; suggests upward momentum, but relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -13.41% (Negative; indicates a recent weakening relative to the S&P 500)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This is a stated expected return relative to the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment; it does not imply a 0% total return.)

The slightly positive PPO and neutral RSI suggest a relatively balanced market sentiment.  The negative relative divergence points to underperformance in the recent past.  The reported 0.0% expected return represents the predicted excess return over the S&P 500, not the overall expected return. A 0% excess return implies that NEE is expected to perform similarly to the S&P 500 over the long term, according to the model used to generate this expectation. There is no indication of a recent sharp price movement (either a sudden surge or plunge) based on the data provided.


**4. Recent Earnings & Outlook:**

The earnings show some variability. While recent quarters have exceeded expectations (Q3 2024 EPS slightly above expectations), some earlier quarters missed slightly.  Overall, the earnings appear generally in line with or slightly exceeding expectations, suggesting a reasonably stable performance.  Further analysis would be required to provide a more complete outlook.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, although its historical performance relative to the index has varied.

The expected 0% excess return relative to the S&P 500 should be considered within the context of its risk profile and its role in a diversified portfolio.
