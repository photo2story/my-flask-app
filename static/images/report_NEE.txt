**1. Performance Comparison:**

NEE's cumulative return (78.06%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (108.99%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -30.9%, placing it at the 14.9th percentile of the historical range (-52.1% to 90%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying Alpha and Beta values across different periods.  While Alpha is mostly positive (indicating outperformance relative to the market),  the high Beta values (especially in 2021-2023) suggest NEE is significantly more volatile than the market.  The recent negative CAGR values indicate a period of underperformance.  The high MDD (maximum drawdown) values highlight substantial risk.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $70.52

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent minor downward trend.  The price is also below the previous day's closing price, indicating a recent small decline (-1.075).

**6. Summary:**

NEE shows strong financials with high profit margins and increasing equity. However, its stock performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 recently, exhibiting higher volatility than the market. While earnings have been consistently good and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term upward trend, the significant underperformance compared to the market and high historical maximum drawdowns highlight considerable risk. The extremely high projected long-term return requires further scrutiny and should be interpreted with caution.  A thorough review of the justification for the projected return and a deeper analysis of the company's long-term growth prospects are necessary before making any investment decisions.
