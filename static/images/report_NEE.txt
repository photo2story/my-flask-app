| 2023-2025  | -10.0%  | 72.6%  | -54.0% | 0.0   | 156.9  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuating CAGR indicates inconsistent growth over the periods analyzed.  The recent negative CAGR figures are concerning.
*   **MDD:** High MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values in recent periods (66.0% and 72.6%) indicate significant price declines, pointing to increased volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Negative Alpha values, particularly in recent years, suggest NEE has underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to 0 or slightly above indicate NEE's price movements are not strongly correlated with the market.  This can be seen as a defensive characteristic, but also limits upside potential during market rallies.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market Cap shows some increasing trend for a period, but the trend is changed recently

*   **20-day Moving Average:** 72.4735
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 72.4977

**Analysis:** The price is slightly down from the previous close. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which is a short-term bullish signal. All the moving averages are positioned close to each other, which may mean the price is entering a consolidation phase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Signals**

*   **RSI:** 75.55 (Overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.7591

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Igridance Change:** 3.9 (Positive - Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 541.4%

**Analysis:**

*   The low MRI suggests relatively low market risk.
*   The RSI being in overbought territory (above 70) indicates the stock might be due for a pullback.
*   A PPO above 0 indicates the price is above its moving average, which is generally bullish.
*   The 'Hybrid Signal' suggests a buy recommendation (90% of cash), categorized as "Safe," given the low MRI.
*   The positive change in relative deviation indicates short-term outperformance against the S&P 500 recently.
*   The high Expected Return (%) should be considered with caution. It indicates a very optimistic long-term outlook compared to the S&P 500, and such high projections are rarely accurate.  It's important to understand the assumptions behind this calculation.
*   The price change of -0.43 is relatively small and does not indicate a significant volatility event.

**7. Overall Analysis and Recommendations**

NEE has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, reflected in its negative cumulative return and Alpha.  However, recent short-term price action is showing signs of recovery, and the technical indicators provide mixed signals. The company has demonstrated consistent earnings performance and maintains strong profit margins.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Underperformance:** Address the reasons for underperformance relative to the S&P 500. Is it sector-specific, company-specific, or a combination?
*   **Volatility:** Be aware of potential volatility, as indicated by news reports and MDD in the Alpha/Beta analysis.
*   **Overbought RSI:**  A potential pullback could be imminent.
*   **Long-Term Potential:** While the "Hybrid Signal" is positive and the long-term "Expected Return" is very high, the latter should be treated with skepticism until supported by more concrete evidence.

**Recommendation:**

The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a cautious "Buy" with a focus on risk management given the potential for a pullback and the need to understand the long-term potential. Investors should closely monitor news and earnings reports and consider the broader economic outlook for the energy sector. Additional research into NEE's specific strategies and competitive landscape is recommended before making any investment decisions.
