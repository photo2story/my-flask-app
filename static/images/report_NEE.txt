## Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) Stock Review

This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE), a leading clean energy company, based on the provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return (53.72%) underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (66.94%) by 13.22 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -13.2% places NEE in the 16.7th percentile of its historical range (max: 95.3%, min: -35.0%). This suggests NEE's performance has lagged the market recently, though not exceptionally so within its historical context.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows a mixed performance. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) was impressive in several periods (reaching 115% between 2019-2021), recent years (2021-2025) show significant negative returns (-64%, -41%, -61%).  Alpha values generally increased over time, suggesting potential outperformance, but this is countered by periods of large negative returns and high maximum drawdown (MDD). Beta consistently remains high, indicating significant market sensitivity.  The company's market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth except in the final years of analysis.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $67.58
* **5-day Moving Average:** $67.16
* **20-day Moving Average:** $69.93
* **60-day Moving Average:** $70.07

The closing price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The recent price increase of $5.41 (from $64.11) indicates a relatively sharp rebound after a period of decrease.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk) – indicates elevated market risk.
* **RSI:** 40.35 – approaching oversold territory (below 30), potentially suggesting a buying opportunity.
* **PPO:** -0.8255 – negative value signifies bearish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +1.0 – Suggests short-term upward movement.
* **Expected Return:** 181.1% – A very high long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500.  The significant increase in price ('change': 5.41) might have inflated this number. Further investigation to validate the basis of this high expected return is required.

EPS has generally exceeded expectations, except in one quarter, indicating a positive trend in earnings.  However, the most recent EPS (0.53) is considerably lower than previous quarters, suggesting possible market concerns.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some volatility but remains generally high, while profit margins are consistently strong (above 55%), indicating healthy profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has grown steadily, and ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates but generally stays above 2%, suggesting reasonable efficiency in using equity to generate profits.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

NEE's performance shows a mixed bag. While exhibiting strong profitability and consistent revenue, its recent stock price performance has lagged the S&P 500, with a considerable negative return in the last few years.  Technical indicators present a mixed signal, with RSI suggesting oversold conditions while PPO and the higher MRI points to bearish momentum and market risk.  The substantial projected long-term return requires further scrutiny.  The high Beta underscores its sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Investors should carefully weigh the company's strong fundamentals against the recent underperformance and market risk before making any investment decisions.  Further research into the underlying reasons for the recent decline and the basis of the high expected return is crucial.
