## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc (NEE), a leading clean energy company focused on electricity generation and distribution,  based on provided financial and performance data.  We will assess its performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), examine recent price movements, and evaluate key financial indicators.


**1) Performance vs. S&P 500:**

NEE's cumulative return is 54.47%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) achieved 71.02%.  This represents a difference of -16.6 percentage points.  Considering the provided historical range of divergence (max: 84.8%, min: -50.8%), NEE's current relative divergence is 25.2%. This means NEE's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is in the lower quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance relative to the market (S&P 500) over different time periods.  While it shows periods of strong outperformance (positive alpha),  recent years (2021-2025) indicate considerable underperformance with negative CAGR and high negative alphas, suggesting significant market sensitivity (high Beta) and underperformance during market downturns. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally increased over the period.  The significant negative CAGR in recent years needs further investigation.



**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $66.91
* **Last Day Change:** -$7.25 (significant daily drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $70.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $71.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $70.18

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend. The substantial one-day drop (-7.25) warrants further investigation into potential news or events that may have triggered this decline.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk) – indicating relatively high market volatility.
* **RSI:** 32.04 (below 30, oversold condition) – Suggests the stock may be undervalued and potentially due for a rebound, but it's crucial to consider the other factors.
* **PPO:** -0.35 (negative, bearish) –  Consistent with the bearish trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.6% (short-term upward trend) – This suggests a recent slight recovery from previous lows, but in the context of other indicators needs careful consideration.
* **Expected Return:** 55.4% (long-term, over 2 years, relative to S&P 500) – A positive outlook for long-term investors, assuming the market recovers and NEE returns to its long-term growth trajectory.  This needs careful consideration given the recent negative performance and the high risk indicators.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 2025-01-24 | $0.53    | $0.53        | $0         |
| 2024-10-23 | $1.03    | $0.98        | $0.05       |
| 2024-07-24 | $0.96    | $0.98        | -$0.02      |
| 2024-04-23 | $0.91    | $0.78        | $0.13       |
| 2024-01-25 | $0.52    | $0.49        | $0.03       |

Recent earnings have generally exceeded expectations, particularly in Q2 and Q1 2024. However, this positive trend needs to be considered alongside the recent negative price movements and high risk indicators.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates quarter to quarter, but profit margins consistently remain high (above 55%), indicating strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown steady growth, but ROE fluctuates, suggesting some variability in profitability relative to equity.  A thorough investigation into the drivers of the ROE fluctuations would be beneficial.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

NEE shows a mixed picture. While historically it has demonstrated periods of strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500 and maintains high profitability, recent performance has been considerably weak. The large negative one-day price movement requires deeper analysis.  The high market risk indicator (MRI), low RSI, negative PPO, and recent negative CAGR raise concerns. However, the positive expected long-term return and relatively strong earnings performance provide some counterbalance.  A more thorough investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the significant daily price drop is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Furthermore, a deeper dive into the company's strategy and long-term prospects would be needed to fully assess its risk and return profile.
