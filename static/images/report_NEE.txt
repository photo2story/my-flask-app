**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

*   **Summary:** NEE has shown strong earnings performance and robust revenue and profitability. However, recent stock performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, with negative returns in recent periods. Technical indicators suggest potential short-term bearish momentum, while the Market Risk Indicator remains low.
*   **Investment Recommendation:** Given the negative short-term indicators and relative underperformance, a cautious approach is warranted. The "Hybrid Signal" aligns with this, suggesting a high cash position. The long-term "Expected Return" is attractive, but requires a disciplined and consistent investment strategy.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Monitor News:** Stay updated on news and company announcements to assess potential risks and opportunities.
    *   **Evaluate ROE Decline:** Investigate the reasons behind the declining Return on Equity to understand the efficiency of capital deployment.
    *   **Long-Term Accumulation:** Consider a long-term accumulation strategy to capitalize on the potential outperformance indicated by the "Expected Return." However, remain vigilant about market conditions and adjust the investment strategy as needed.
