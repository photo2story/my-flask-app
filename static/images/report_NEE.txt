## Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) is a leading clean energy company, generating and delivering electricity through renewable sources and advanced technologies.

Over the measured period, NEE's cumulative return (103.96%) lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) return (123.86%) by 19.9 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -19.9% places it at the 20.7th percentile of its historical range (max: 98.39%, min: -50.77%).  This suggests that while NEE has performed well, it has underperformed the broader market recently, relative to its own historical performance.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant fluctuations in performance across different periods. While some periods showcased exceptional growth (e.g., 2017-2019 with 120.6% CAGR), others experienced negative growth (2021-2023 with -12.4% CAGR).  The Alpha values indicate periods of outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha) compared to the market, largely driven by its Beta, which shows NEE's sensitivity to market movements. The Beta fluctuates between 0.2 and 0.9, indicating varying degrees of market correlation.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures in several periods indicate significant potential for risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $76.35
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $75.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $78.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $81.25

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The proximity to the 5-day moving average indicates some short term support, however, the distance from the other moving averages signals a need for additional upward momentum to reverse the bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 32.44 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.34 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -14.67 – Shows a recent downward trend in relative performance compared to the benchmark.

The closing price of $76.34 is not significantly different to trigger a "sudden jump" or "sudden drop" analysis, considering it's near the 5-day moving average.  The expected return is stated as 0.0%, implying no significant expected alpha over the S&P 500 in the long term (2+ years) based on the provided data. This needs further analysis with more comprehensive models.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The most recent earnings report (2024-10-23) showed an EPS of $1.03, exceeding the expected EPS of $0.98.  While some quarters have surpassed expectations, others have fallen short.  Overall, the earnings are reasonably stable, but lack a consistent upward trend.  Further information is needed to project future performance definitively.  A more detailed look at the drivers of revenue and profit margin changes over time is necessary for a full evaluation.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information shows relatively consistent revenue and profit margins over the past year. Profit margins remain above 59%, displaying a strong operational efficiency. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) shows fluctuations, suggesting some variability in efficiency of capital utilization.


**6. Revenue and Profitability Analysis:**

Revenue is fairly consistent with fluctuations within a $6B-$7.5B range.   Profit margins are stable and high, generally above 60%.  This demonstrates a robust and profitable business model.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of these numbers and to forecast future trends.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

NEE has demonstrated a history of strong growth in several periods, but recent performance has lagged the S&P 500.  While the company exhibits sound financial fundamentals,  with high profit margins and consistent revenues, recent price action and the lower than market return suggest some cautiousness. Technical indicators signal potential for a short-term bounce, but the overall trend appears somewhat bearish.  A thorough analysis of recent news, analyst ratings, and a deeper dive into the drivers of financial performance are crucial for forming a robust investment conclusion.  The provided data points to a potentially undervalued stock with a history of outsized performance but needs further analysis to determine the overall investment outlook for the long term.
