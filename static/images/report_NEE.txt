*   **Expected Return:** 3906.2% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500, if dollar-cost averaging)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a low-risk environment. The RSI indicates an oversold condition, which could signal a potential buying opportunity. The negative PPO reinforces the downtrend. The hybrid signal recommends a high cash position, reflecting a cautious outlook. The negative change in relative spread further supports the recent underperformance. The extremely high expected return is an interesting point, suggesting potential for long-term outperformance if a dollar-cost averaging strategy is employed. However, such a high figure should be viewed with skepticism and further investigated.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Dividend Champion:** Highlighted as a dividend stock to watch.

**Analysis:** Recent news presents a mixed picture. The Goldman Sachs rating is positive. The dividend champion mention is also generally positive for long-term investors. However, the Morningstar report and broader market news warrant deeper review.

**7. 종합 Analysis**

NEE is currently underperforming the S&P 500, and recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend. However, the RSI indicates an oversold condition, and analyst consensus is "Buy" with a potentially significant upside. The MRI indicates low market risk. Earnings have been consistently meeting or exceeding expectations, and financial metrics like revenue and profit margins appear strong.

The hybrid signal's recommendation to sell 70% of holdings and the recent negative change in relative spread suggest caution. The very high expected return should be carefully scrutinized.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted.

*   **Potential positives:** Strong earnings, analyst "Buy" consensus, oversold RSI, dividend champion status, and low market risk.
*   **Potential negatives:** Underperformance vs. S&P 500, short-term downtrend, cautious hybrid signal, and concerns around the extremely high expected return.

A deeper investigation into the reasons for the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the basis for the very high expected return is recommended before making any investment decisions. The Morningstar report and other news headlines should be reviewed for additional context.
