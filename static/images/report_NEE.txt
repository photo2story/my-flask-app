**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

While showing periods of high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), recent years (2021-2025) show significant negative returns and high maximum drawdowns (MDD).

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $70.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $73.90

The price is currently above its 5 and 20-day moving averages, but below its 60-day moving average, suggesting potential short-term upward momentum, but possibly a longer-term downtrend.  The recent significant price increase (5.2% from the previous close) indicates a possible short-term bullish trend that warrants further analysis.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.45 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.50 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.6 (Suggests a recent short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 266.2% (This represents a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years).  However, the reliability of this projection needs to be further evaluated based on the methodology used to derive this estimate).  The high expected return should be viewed cautiously, particularly given the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters, except for Q2 2024. This positive trend, though interrupted in a recent quarter, suggests a relatively strong financial performance.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows some fluctuation. Profit margins are consistently high, above 59%, indicating strong profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily increasing. ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, suggesting potential variability in the efficiency of capital utilization.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE exhibits a mixed performance profile. While demonstrating periods of significant growth and consistently high profit margins, recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500.  The high expected long-term return needs further investigation to assess the reliability of such a high projection.  The positive earnings surprises suggest a healthy underlying business, but the volatility and recent underperformance compared to the market warrants a closer look at the underlying drivers of the business before investment decisions are made.   The technical indicators present a mixed signal, and further analysis is needed to confirm any short-term trends.
