## Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) is a leading clean energy company.  The cumulative return of NEE is 79.68%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 115.96%.  This represents a difference of -36.3%.  The relative divergence of -36.3% places NEE at the 11.1 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating underperformance compared to the benchmark.

**Analysis of provided Alpha/Beta Table:**  The provided data shows inconsistent performance, with significant CAGR fluctuations and periods of high and low Maximum Drawdown (MDD).  The consistently near-zero alpha suggests NEE's performance is largely correlated with the market (high beta), with minimal alpha generation (outperformance beyond market returns).  The extremely negative CAGR in 2021-2023 is a significant concern.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $71.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $72.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $77.41

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, indicating a potential bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 35.33 (Below 50, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.08 (Positive, but close to zero, indicating weak momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 223.6% (This figure requires clarification. Is this an absolute return or an excess return relative to a benchmark?  The timeframe is also unclear.)

Given the current price of $71.76 is below the moving averages, the positive short-term relative divergence might signal a potential short-term rebound, but the low RSI and near-zero PPO suggest a lack of strong buying pressure. The high expected return of 223.6% requires further context and justification.  No information in the provided data explains this high figure.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some quarter-to-quarter EPS variability.  While EPS has generally trended upward, there were instances of misses in expectations (Q2 2024, Q1 2024).  However, the most recent quarter (Q3 2024) beat expectations.  There is no revenue data provided, so we cannot comment on revenue growth trends.

| 2024-07-24 | 0.96 | 0.98         | Miss       |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.91 | 0.78         | Beat       |

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue has shown some volatility, with a peak in Q3 2023 and a decline in Q2 2024 before increasing again in Q3 2024. Profit margins are consistently high, though they fluctuated slightly quarter-to-quarter. Equity has generally increased, reflecting company growth. ROE also fluctuates, suggesting variability in profitability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Therefore, a current market outlook and recent performance highlights cannot be assessed based on the given information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE's performance has lagged the S&P 500 over the period shown.  While recent earnings have shown some strength with a beat in the latest quarter, the overall picture is mixed, reflecting inconsistent growth, and periods of substantial negative performance.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but without strong momentum. The high expected return claim needs further clarification. Further information on news, analyst sentiment, and long-term growth prospects is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation.  The significantly negative CAGR in 2021-2023 is particularly concerning and warrants deeper investigation.

**8. Recommendation:**

Based solely on the limited data provided, a definitive buy or sell recommendation cannot be made. Further analysis, including information on revenue growth, long-term growth prospects, competitive landscape, and risk factors, is needed before forming a sound investment opinion.  The substantial discrepancies between years in the alpha/beta analysis require further context and explanation.  Consideration should be given to the negative CAGR recorded in 2021-2023.  The unexpectedly high expected return (223.6%) requires validation and context before it can be considered credible.
