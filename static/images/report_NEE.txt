**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within 2 days) earnings news is provided.  The lack of information on market outlook and analyst opinions limits a comprehensive assessment of current sentiment.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE has shown significant historical volatility and a recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While the company exhibits high profitability and growing revenue,  recent price action and some mixed earnings results point to a potentially uncertain outlook in the near term.  The high long-term expected return should be viewed with skepticism. The relatively low RSI suggests that the stock might be oversold and a short-term bounce-back may be possible, but further analysis of factors outside this dataset (e.g., industry trends, regulatory changes) is needed for a thorough evaluation.  The significant negative CAGR over the 2021-2023 period is a major concern. The high beta suggests increased sensitivity to market fluctuations, which adds to the risk profile.
