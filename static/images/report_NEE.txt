* **5-day Moving Average:** 73.93
* **20-day Moving Average:** 75.95
* **60-day Moving Average:** 79.11

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 37.39 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, but this is not conclusive on its own.)
* **PPO:** -0.28 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -2.0 (Indicates a recent weakening in relative strength.)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term, vs. S&P 500):** 0.0%  (This indicates no expected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term based on the provided data.  This should be considered preliminary given the short time-frame.)
* **Price Consideration:** The current price of 73.62, being below the moving averages, does not indicate a significant recent price jump or drop, but rather a consistent downward trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a mixed picture in terms of EPS performance. While the company beat expectations in some quarters (2024-04-23 and 2023-10-24), it missed in others (2024-07-24). EPS growth isn't consistently upward, suggesting potential underlying challenges in the company's profitability.  It's crucial to note that this analysis is limited to the provided data; a broader context including revenue growth figures would enhance understanding.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows some fluctuation but a general upward trend.  However, a more thorough analysis including YoY growth rates would be beneficial.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are generally high and relatively stable, suggesting a profitable business model. However, a slight decrease is observed in Q2 2024.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity is increasing, but ROE shows significant variability and a downward trend in the most recent quarters.

A deeper dive into these figures, incorporating industry benchmarks and peer comparisons, would provide a more informed assessment of the company's financial health.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions are provided within the given context.  Access to real-time news sources would be necessary to provide information on recent market outlooks and analyst sentiment.  The absence of recent earnings news within the last two days suggests that no significant news affecting the stock price was released recently.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE currently shows mixed signals. While the company has a strong business model with high profit margins and growing revenue, its recent stock performance has underperformed the S&P 500 considerably. Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, and the inconsistent EPS results warrant further investigation. The lack of recent news hinders a complete picture.  Long-term investors should carefully consider the volatile recent performance and the lack of significant expected outperformance versus the S&P 500  before making an investment decision.  Additional research into revenue growth trends, industry comparisons, and macroeconomic factors affecting the clean energy sector are necessary.
