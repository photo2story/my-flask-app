**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period considered, showing a cumulative return 45.7% lower than the benchmark.  The relative underperformance puts it at the 4.5th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results. While CAGR was consistently high from 2015-2021,  alpha values suggest the outperformance was mostly due to market-wide trends (high Beta values). The dramatic negative CAGR in 2021-2023 highlights significant downside risk. The recent decline in CAGR and the increased Beta in the last few periods indicate increasing market sensitivity.  The substantial market cap (Cap(B)) growth reflects overall expansion, but profitability isn't necessarily reflected in stock price performance over the last 2 years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $69.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $69.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $72.64

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price increase from the previous close (2.09%) might be a temporary bounce within this trend.  Further observation is necessary.


**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI:** 46.59 (slightly below neutral; indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.0997 (negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.2% (indicates short-term downward trend)

The combination of a slightly below neutral RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests a bearish short-term outlook. The recent price increase could be a temporary rebound or a false signal.  More data is needed to confirm the direction of the trend.  The high expected return is a long-term projection and doesn't negate the current bearish technical signals.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE demonstrates strong financial fundamentals with consistent revenue and profitability. However, recent stock performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The high projected long-term return needs to be weighed against the current bearish technical indicators and the recent periods of significant underperformance relative to the market. The substantial negative CAGR from 2021-2023 is particularly concerning.  Further investigation into the drivers of this underperformance, alongside careful monitoring of market trends and technical indicators, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  While the long-term outlook based on the expected return is optimistic, current indicators suggest caution.  A more thorough risk assessment is needed to evaluate the viability of a long-term investment strategy.
