## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Investment Review

This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc (NEE), a leading clean energy company, based on provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) is a leading clean energy company focused on electricity generation and distribution.  The cumulative return of NEE is 77.91%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 120.36%.  This results in a difference of -42.4%, placing it at the 6.8th percentile of the historical spread between NEE and VOO's performance.  While NEE has shown strong growth, it has underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR data shows significant fluctuations in NEE's performance over the years, ranging from extremely high growth to significant losses.  The consistently near-zero Alpha suggests that the stock's performance is largely explained by market movements (Beta), rather than outperformance driven by company-specific factors.  However, the high beta indicates significant volatility and sensitivity to overall market trends. The significantly negative CAGR in recent years raises concerns.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 39.0% | 9.8% | 12.0% | -0.0 | 146.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 44.0% | 9.8% | 29.0% | -0.0 | 146.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 80.0% | 8.1% | 48.0% | -0.0 | 146.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 90.0% | 35.6% | 57.0% | -0.0 | 146.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 116.0% | 35.6% | 36.0% | -0.0 | 146.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 33.0% | 35.6% | 25.0% | -0.0 | 146.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -61.0% | 40.4% | -85.0% | -0.0 | 146.0 |
| 2022-2024  | -71.0% | 40.4% | -92.0% | -0.0 | 146.0 |
| 2023-2025  | -41.0% | 38.4% | -112.0% | -0.0 | 146.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $70.85
* 5-day Moving Average: $70.05
* 20-day Moving Average: $70.76
* 60-day Moving Average: $74.52

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term bullish momentum. However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* RSI: 44.51 (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions).
* PPO: 0.33 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum).
* 20-Day Relative Strength Divergence: +1.3 (Short-term upward trend).
* Expected Return (2+ years): 368.9% (This exceptionally high figure requires further scrutiny and justification, as it implies a substantial outperformance of the S&P 500 which is unlikely).  The provided data does not support this excessively high projected return.

The small price increase from the previous close is not significant enough to suggest a dramatic shift in market sentiment (no sudden surge or fall observed).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters, particularly in Q1 and Q2 of 2024, demonstrating relatively strong performance. However, recent quarters have shown a slowing of EPS growth.

| Date       | EPS   | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|-------|-------------|------------|
| 2024-10-23 | 1.03  | 0.98         | +0.05      |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.96  | 0.98         | -0.02      |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.91  | 0.78         | +0.13      |
| 2024-01-25 | 0.52  | 0.49         | +0.03      |
| 2023-10-24 | 0.94  | 0.86         | +0.08      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has shown some fluctuations but generally remains strong. Profit margins are consistently high, indicating efficient operations. ROE, while fluctuating, is generally positive but not exceptionally high, suggesting a moderate return on invested capital.  A more detailed analysis would be needed to fully understand the drivers of profitability and equity growth.


| Quarter     | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | $7.57        | 64.35%         | $50.05      | 3.70    |
| 2024-06-30  | $6.07        | 59.61%         | $49.14      | 3.30    |
| 2024-03-31  | $5.73        | 59.36%         | $48.64      | 4.66    |
| 2023-12-31  | $6.88        | 64.13%         | $47.47      | 2.55    |
| 2023-09-30  | $7.17        | 61.66%         | $47.09      | 2.59    |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE shows a mixed picture. While it has demonstrated strong revenue and profit margins, and has exceeded earnings expectations in several recent quarters,  its recent performance significantly lags the S&P 500, and its high beta suggests considerable market risk.  The extremely high projected return of 368.9% over two years is not supported by the historical data and requires serious re-evaluation.  Further investigation into the factors driving the recent negative CAGR is necessary before any investment decision can be made.  Caution is advised given the volatility and recent underperformance relative to the market.  The provided data alone is insufficient for a confident long-term investment recommendation.  Additional due diligence is critical.
