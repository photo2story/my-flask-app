**7. Overall Assessment:**

NEE presents a mixed picture. While it has a history of outperforming the S&P 500 and strong financial fundamentals, recent performance (2021-2025) shows a decline in CAGR and Alpha. The stock is currently showing bullish momentum in the short-term, fueled by positive news and analyst sentiment. However, the overbought RSI suggests a potential pullback.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Strengths:** Solid financials, consistent earnings beats, positive analyst ratings, leadership in clean energy.
*   **Weaknesses:** Recent underperformance relative to historical data, overbought RSI.
*   **Recommendation:** A cautious approach is warranted. Consider the potential for a short-term pullback due to the overbought RSI. Long-term investors may find NEE attractive due to its strong fundamentals and growth potential in the renewable energy sector, but should carefully monitor performance trends and consider diversifying their portfolio. The high expected return should be viewed with skepticism and as a potential upside scenario.
