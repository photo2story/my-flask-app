This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE), a leading clean energy company, based on the provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return (71.30%) underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (76.08%) by 4.78 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -4.8% places it in the 18.7th percentile of its historical range (max: 109.2%, min: -31.1%).  While underperforming recently, this is not exceptionally unusual given its historical fluctuation.

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows significant variations in CAGR and MDD across different periods.  Alphas are generally positive, indicating outperformance relative to the market (Beta), although recent years show higher Betas suggesting increased market sensitivity.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap) reflects company growth.  The negative CAGRs in the last three periods (-63%, -39%, -63%) are concerning and require further investigation into underlying factors.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

NEE's closing price is $65.64, down $2.99 (-4.42%) from the previous close ($67.66).  The stock is trading below its 5-day ($66.70), 20-day ($68.63), and 60-day ($69.84) moving averages, indicating a potential downward trend.  This suggests a recent period of bearish pressure.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The MRI of 0.41 suggests a low to medium risk.  The RSI (39.13) is below 40, indicating oversold conditions. The negative PPO (-0.35) further supports the bearish trend. The positive 20-day relative divergence change (+1.2) suggests short-term upward pressure, despite overall negative trends.  The significant price drop from the previous close (-$2.99) indicates a recent period of downward pressure, lacking a clear sign of sharp recovery or decline.  The projected long-term (2+ years) expected return of 191% against the S&P 500 is extremely high and requires careful consideration of its derivation and underlying assumptions.  It is crucial to remember that these are projections and not guarantees.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

NEE has consistently exceeded or met EPS expectations in recent quarters, except for a slight miss in Q2 2024. While there is a considerable jump in the EPS from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025, this should be further analyzed considering the company's seasonal revenue trends.

|------------|-------|----------|
| 2025-01-24 | 0.53  | 0.53      |

| 2024-01-25 | 0.52  | 0.49      |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some volatility, but generally remains strong. Profit margins are consistently high, indicating good profitability.  Equity has been steadily increasing, although ROE fluctuates.  The decrease in ROE from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024 warrants further review.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

NEE shows a mixed performance. While the company exhibits strong profitability and consistent EPS beats (except for a minor miss in Q2 2024),  recent price action indicates a bearish trend.  The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the last three periods warrants close attention. Further investigation into the reasons for the declining CAGR and the exceptionally high projected long-term return is necessary.  Investors should carefully assess the risks associated with the current market conditions and the company's recent performance before making any investment decisions.  The high projected return should be treated with significant skepticism unless supporting data is provided.  Analyzing sector-specific factors and macroeconomic influences will provide a more comprehensive understanding of NEE's future prospects.
