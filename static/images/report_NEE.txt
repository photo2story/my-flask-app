## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Stock Review

This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc (NEE), a leading clean energy company focused on electricity generation and distribution.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return of 53.61% lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) at 66.69% by 13.08 percentage points.  Considering the historical range of the relative divergence (max: 95.3, min: -35.0), the current -13.1 point difference places NEE at the 16.8th percentile relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates NEE's underperformance relative to the market, though it's important to note the relatively recent downward trend.


The Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results. While CAGR has been strong in some periods (reaching 115% from 2019-2021), more recent periods (2021-2025) show significant negative returns.  The beta consistently sits above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market. The relatively consistent and elevated Alpha suggests the stock has generated returns that exceed those expected from its beta alone, at least in earlier periods.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $69.96

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $2.86 (from $65.81) indicates a moderate upward swing, requiring further observation to confirm if this is a trend reversal or a temporary fluctuation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE's performance has been mixed. While it boasts strong profitability and high profit margins, recent negative CAGR and a significant underperformance against the S&P 500 raise concerns.  The high projected long-term return should be viewed with considerable skepticism given the recent underperformance and volatility.  Further investigation into the drivers of the recent negative returns and a more detailed risk assessment are crucial before making any investment decisions. The relatively high beta and the mixed technical indicators point to a need for caution. While the long-term outlook for clean energy remains positive, NEE's current situation requires closer monitoring.  The high expected return needs significantly more robust justification and should not be taken at face value.
