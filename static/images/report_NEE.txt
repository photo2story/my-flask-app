## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Stock Review

**0. Overview:** Nextera Energy Inc. is a leading clean energy company focused on electricity generation and delivery.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

NEE's cumulative return (77.15%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (117.28%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -40.1%, placing it at the 8.4th percentile of the historical range of differences (max: 90.0%, min: -52.1%). This indicates NEE's performance lagged behind the broader market.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating Alpha and Beta values across different time periods.  While Alpha is generally positive, indicating some outperformance, it's not consistently high. Beta values are mostly above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market.  The significant negative CAGR (-81%) and substantial Maximum Drawdown (-104%) in the 2021-2023 period are notable red flags.  The recent periods also show negative CAGR suggesting underperformance against the broader market.  The high beta suggests that NEE's performance is strongly correlated with market movements but amplifies those movements.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2015-2017  | 36.0% | 6.8% | 8.0% | -0.0 | 67.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 36.0% | 6.8% | 17.0% | 0.0 | 77.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $70.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $70.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $71.75

The price is slightly below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term. The recent price change (-$1.09) indicates a minor decline.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (48.92):**  Indicates the stock is nearing oversold territory, but not quite there.
* **PPO (0.37):**  A positive value suggests a bullish momentum, though relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+8.0):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend.

The significant negative price change in the `Last-market` data does suggest recent price weakness potentially countering the positive PPO and relative strength change.  A deeper analysis of the price chart would be helpful to ascertain a definitive trend.

The expected return of 261.9% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a very high estimate and needs further validation given the recent performance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently exceeded EPS expectations, except for the quarter ending 2024-07-24 and 2024-01-25. While this is generally positive, the recent earnings aren't exceptionally strong.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-01-24 | 0.53 | 0.53 | 0.00 |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has been fluctuating, showing no clear trend.  Profit margins are consistently high, indicating strong profitability.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NEE has shown strong profitability and consistent earnings beats. However, its recent stock performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, with concerning negative CAGRs in recent years and high volatility (reflected in the Beta).  While the technical indicators present a mixed picture, the recent price drop and lagging market performance raise concerns. The high projected long-term return requires further scrutiny.  A more in-depth analysis including a review of industry trends, competitive landscape, and management outlook is necessary before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The current data suggests a cautious approach.
