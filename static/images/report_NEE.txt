**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return slightly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The relative deviation suggests this underperformance falls within the typical historical range of fluctuations relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of significant outperformance (e.g., 2019-2021 at 129%), recent years (2021-2025) show substantial negative returns. The Beta consistently remains above 0, indicating higher volatility than the market. The market cap has generally increased over the years but shows some fluctuation.  The relatively low Alpha values, especially in earlier years, suggest NEE's performance has often closely tracked the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $64.68
* **Previous Close:** $66.31
* **Change:** -$1.63 (A 2.46% drop)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $66.40
* **20-day Moving Average:** $68.07
* **60-day Moving Average:** $69.75

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The recent drop of $1.63 reflects a notable price decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.64 (Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory.)
* **PPO:** -0.3772 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Recent Relative Deviation Change (20-day):** +4.2% (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 164.3% (This represents a significant potential outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term, however this projection requires further validation)

The technical indicators paint a somewhat bearish picture, with the RSI and PPO suggesting downward momentum. However, the recent positive change in relative deviation and the projected long-term expected return indicate potential for recovery.  The significant recent price drop warrants further investigation into potential underlying causes.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE shows a mixed performance picture. While it has historically demonstrated periods of strong growth and outperformance relative to the S&P 500, recent performance has been weaker.  The negative recent price movement and bearish technical indicators suggest caution. However, the long-term expected return remains optimistic, provided the underlying drivers for that projection are valid.  Further due diligence is needed to assess the sustainability of long-term growth projections.  Understanding the reasons for recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the significant recent price drop is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A deeper dive into sector-specific factors, competitive landscape, and potential regulatory changes would further refine the analysis.
