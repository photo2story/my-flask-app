This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc (NEE), a leading clean energy company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return (71.74%) slightly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (76.18%) by 4.44 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -4.4% places it in the 19th percentile of its historical range (-31.1% to 109.2%), indicating it is somewhat underperforming compared to its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows significant variability in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across different periods, ranging from a substantial positive return (129%) to significant negative returns (-63%).  While Alpha values suggest outperformance relative to the market (Beta > 1), it's crucial to note the considerable volatility.  The Beta values are largely stable, though, demonstrating that the stock tends to be highly sensitive to market movements. Market cap consistently increased until 2023, suggesting general growth before a recent possible market downturn.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $68.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $69.81

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.02 (from $65.64) suggests a short-term bounce; however, this may be short-lived.

* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +1.2 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** 186.5% over the long-term (2+ years), exceeding the S&P 500.  This should be treated with caution, as high expected returns are generally coupled with correspondingly high levels of risk.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NEE shows mixed signals.  While its long-term projected return is high and earnings have generally been positive, recent performance has lagged the S&P 500 and technical indicators suggest a potentially bearish short-term outlook.  The significant volatility in CAGR and the relatively high beta underscore the risk associated with this investment.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and time horizon before investing in NEE, focusing on long-term growth potential rather than short-term market fluctuations.  Further research into the factors contributing to the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is recommended.
