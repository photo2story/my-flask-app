*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  This shows the average annual growth rate over the period.  Notice the steep drop in recent periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** This indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  NEE has seen significant drawdowns in recent years.
*   **Alpha:** This measures the investment's performance relative to a benchmark (presumably S&P 500).  Positive alpha indicates outperformance, negative indicates underperformance. The recent negative alpha suggests significant underperformance compared to the market.
*   **Beta:** This measures the investment's volatility relative to the market. A beta near zero suggests NEE's returns are relatively uncorrleated with the broader market (S&P 500 in this case).
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** This indicates the approximate company market capitalization.

**Analysis:**  NEE had strong performance from 2017-2021. The recent periods (2021-2025) show significantly negative CAGR and very negative Alpha, indicating a significant period of underperformance compared to the market.  High MDD values also suggest greater risk.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 80.53
*   **Previous Close:** 80.27
*   **Change:** 0.32
*   **5-day SMA:** 80.29
*   **20-day SMA:** 81.31
*   **60-day SMA:** 83.06

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 5-day SMA, but below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This *could* indicate a short-term upward trend, but the longer-term trend (represented by the 60-day SMA) is still downward.

**3. Indicators Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium to High Investment Recommended). *Note:  An MRI of 0.9 is interpreted as "High Investment Recommended" despite its risks.*
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 56.17 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.0591 (Bearish - although close to zero)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (11 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)"
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.6 (Indicates recent short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 108.7% (Long-term, potentially significant outperformance over S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI is surprisingly high, suggesting a favorable investment environment, even though the stock is not doing that well relative to VOO.  The RSI is neutral, the PPO is slightly bearish, and divergence change indicates a recent downtrend. However, the expected return is very optimistic for long-term investors.
