**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NEE shows a mixed performance picture.  While historically demonstrating strong growth and potential outperformance, recent periods show significant losses. Its high beta suggests significant market sensitivity. The absence of key financial data (revenue and gross profit) significantly limits a thorough evaluation. The high expected return should be treated with caution due to the volatility and the unavailability of comprehensive financial information.  Further investigation into the company's fundamentals and the reasons for recent negative returns is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The medium risk classification from the MRI should be carefully considered in the context of its high volatility.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering this stock.
