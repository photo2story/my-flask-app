**6. News and Recent Issues:**  This section requires additional information.  No recent earnings news within the last two days was provided.  Information about market outlook and analyst opinions is needed to complete the analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE shows a mixed performance. While it has historically demonstrated strong growth in certain periods (as seen in the CAGR data), its recent performance relative to the S&P 500 is lagging and has shown some downward trends. Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition, but this should be considered alongside the overall market outlook and fundamental analysis.  The company demonstrates consistently high profit margins and increasing revenue.  However, EPS growth is inconsistent, and recent quarters have shown mixed results against analyst expectations.  The high expected return figure needs further justification and context.  Further information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions would greatly enhance the investment assessment.  More data, particularly regarding revenue growth trends (not just the provided quarterly revenue numbers) are needed to support the 202.4% projected long-term return.
