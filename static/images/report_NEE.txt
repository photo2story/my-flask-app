This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE), a leading clean energy company, based on provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return (41.44%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 89.25%.  The divergence is -47.8%, placing it at the 13.1 percentile of historical divergence relative to the S&P 500 based on a range of -65.5% to 69.4%.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta significantly higher than 1 in several periods) and positive alpha in recent years, suggesting potential outperformance but also significant risk.  High maximum drawdown (MDD) values highlight considerable volatility. The consistently high beta indicates that NEE's returns are highly correlated with the overall market performance. The very negative CAGR in recent years (-70%, -42%, -27%) is a very concerning trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE shows strong financial fundamentals with high profit margins and relatively stable equity. However, the stock's recent performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility and substantial negative returns over the last few years. While the long-term expected return is positive, the current technical indicators and recent negative CAGR suggest a bearish outlook in the short to medium term. Investors should carefully consider the significant risk associated with NEE before investing, focusing on the longer-term potential growth while acknowledging the substantial downside risk.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent underperformance is crucial before making any investment decisions.
