**Analysis:**  NEE shows high CAGR in several periods, indicating strong growth potential.

* **RSI:** 40.92 (Approaching oversold territory)

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE has shown periods of exceptional growth but recently underperformed the S&P 500. While the company exhibits strong profitability and a promising long-term outlook (184.1% expected return), recent negative CAGR and technical indicators suggest short-term caution.  The significant price increase on the last market day warrants attention, potentially indicating a reversal of the downward trend, but further observation is needed to confirm.  A comprehensive analysis requires deeper investigation into the company's future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and potential risks.  The long-term expected return is promising, but investors should carefully consider the short-term volatility and risk before making investment decisions.
