**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $65.81
* **Previous Close:** $66.72
* **Change:** -$1.36 (-2.04%)  This represents a relatively small daily decline.
* **5-day Moving Average:** $65.86
* **20-day Moving Average:** $69.24
* **60-day Moving Average:** $70.01

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.89 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.72 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.3% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 189.7%  This suggests a significant potential outperformance of the S&P 500 over a 2+ year investment horizon, *but this must be interpreted cautiously given the recent negative performance and high market risk indicator.*

The negative price change and overall indicators suggest bearish sentiment.  The high expected return should be considered in the context of the high risk indicated by the MRI and the recent underperformance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE shows a mixed picture.  While recent earnings have been positive, the stock price has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the past few years and is currently showing bearish technical indicators. The high beta indicates substantial market sensitivity.  The high expected return over the long term needs to be weighed against the considerable current risks highlighted by the negative recent performance, high market risk indicator, and bearish technical indicators. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the recent underperformance and to assess the validity of the long-term expected return.  More complete data, particularly YoY comparisons, would allow for a more thorough and nuanced assessment.
