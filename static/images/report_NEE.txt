The predicted long-term (2+ years) expected return of 2543% against the S&P 500 seems exceptionally high and requires further scrutiny.  This prediction's reliability needs validation.  The provided data does not support this dramatic expected return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

NEE has consistently exceeded or met EPS expectations in recent quarters.  While this is positive, it doesn't fully explain the recent underperformance against the market.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-01-24 | 0.53 | 0.53 | 0.00 |
| 2024-10-23 | 1.03 | 0.98 | 0.05 |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.96 | 0.98 | -0.02 |

| 2024-01-25 | 0.52 | 0.49 | 0.03 |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins show some fluctuations. ROE is also inconsistent, with a decline in recent quarters.  Further investigation into the causes of these fluctuations is necessary.


| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity | ROE |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $7.57B | 64.35% | $50.05B | 3.70% |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.07B | 59.61% | $49.14B | 3.30% |
| 2024-03-31 | $5.73B | 59.36% | $48.64B | 4.66% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.88B | 64.13% | $47.47B | 2.55% |
| 2023-09-30 | $7.17B | 61.66% | $47.09B | 2.59% |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NEE's recent performance has significantly lagged behind the S&P 500. While past performance showed strong growth, recent negative CAGR and a high beta suggest increased market sensitivity.  While the company shows consistent earnings and relatively stable revenue,  further analysis is needed to understand the reasons for the recent underperformance. The extremely high projected future return is unrealistic based on the provided data.  The oversold RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, but the overall trend requires careful consideration before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence, including analyzing macroeconomic factors and the competitive landscape, is crucial.
