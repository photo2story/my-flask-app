## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) is a leading clean energy company focused on electricity generation and distribution.  The provided data shows that NEE's cumulative return (77.68%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's return (118.37%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -40.7%, placing it at the 8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows high growth in some years but extremely negative growth in recent years (-61%, -71%, -41% from 2021-2025).  The alpha consistently remains around 0, suggesting its returns are primarily driven by market movements (beta is high at around 146, indicating high market sensitivity).  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlights significant periods of losses, especially in recent years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last market close, NEE's price is $70.76. The 5-day moving average is $69.27, the 20-day moving average is $70.75, and the 60-day moving average is $74.72. This indicates a recent slight decline, as the price is below all three moving averages.  The price is relatively close to the 20-day MA suggesting moderate short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (43.09):** This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.  However, it's not significantly below 30, so the strength of this signal is moderate.
* **PPO (0.214):** A positive PPO value suggests bullish momentum, though relatively weak.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent positive shift in relative divergence suggests short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (309.3%):** This extraordinarily high long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs significant scrutiny.  Such a high figure may be based on very optimistic assumptions and should not be taken as a guaranteed outcome. Itâ€™s crucial to understand the underlying model and assumptions used for this projection.  The current price near the 20-day MA and slightly below the 60-day MA doesn't clearly support this high expectation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

NEE's recent earnings have shown some variability. While EPS has generally exceeded expectations, the most recent quarter showed a slight miss.  The positive trend appears to be continuing but at a slower pace than previous quarters. The Q3 2024 EPS beat the estimate, showing positive momentum that is worth monitoring going forward.

| Date       | EPS   | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| 2024-10-23 | 1.03  | 0.98         | +0.05       |
| 2024-07-24 | 0.96  | 0.98         | -0.02       |
| 2024-04-23 | 0.91  | 0.78         | +0.13       |
| 2024-01-25 | 0.52  | 0.49         | +0.03       |
| 2023-10-24 | 0.94  | 0.86         | +0.08       |


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has been relatively stable, fluctuating slightly between quarters. Profit margins remain consistently high, indicating strong profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is growing steadily, and ROE shows some fluctuation but generally indicates positive return on investment.  However, ROE is relatively modest considering the high profit margins.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE's performance has lagged the S&P 500 in recent periods showing a significant underperformance compared to the market. The high expected return is a significant outlier and demands further investigation of the model used to arrive at that figure. While technical indicators suggest potential short-term upward movement, the longer-term trend is less clear, and the high market sensitivity (beta) suggests vulnerability to market downturns.  Fundamental data shows strong profitability and revenue, although ROE is relatively modest compared to the profit margins.  A more thorough analysis, including a deeper dive into the expected return calculation and a consideration of macroeconomic factors and industry trends, would be necessary to draw conclusive investment recommendations.
