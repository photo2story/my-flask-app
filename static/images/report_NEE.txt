## Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) is a leading clean energy company.  The provided data shows NEE's cumulative return at 73.84% is significantly lower than the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 122.83%. The difference is -49.0%, placing it at the 2.2nd percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  While NEE exhibited strong CAGR in several periods (2017-2019 reaching 80%),  recent performance (2021-2025) has been significantly negative. The consistently near-zero alpha suggests its performance largely tracks the market, but with lower returns than the S&P 500 index. The Beta consistently around 1 indicates a similar volatility compared to S&P 500.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $69.23
* **5-day Moving Average:** $70.14
* **20-day Moving Average:** $70.58
* **60-day Moving Average:** $74.04

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent 1.08% increase shows a minor rebound from the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 41.31 – Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.1788 –  A positive value suggests a bullish signal.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -4.5% – Shows a short-term downward trend.

The provided 'change' from the previous close (1.08%) shows a small price increase, which should be considered within the broader downward trend indicated by the moving averages. The extremely high expected return of 1211% over a long-term horizon (2+ years) appears exceptionally optimistic and needs further justification and should be treated with caution.  It's crucial to consider the risks associated with such a projection.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some variability, but generally, NEE has exceeded or closely met EPS expectations in recent quarters.  While a slight miss in Q2 2024 is noticeable, the overall trend demonstrates consistent performance near or above expectations.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue has fluctuated between $5.73B and $7.57B over the last four quarters, while profit margins have remained relatively high, consistently above 59%.
* **Capital & Profitability:**  Equity shows steady growth, though ROE has been fluctuating.  The ROE, while positive, is not exceptionally high, suggesting moderate returns on invested capital.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500. While the company has demonstrated consistent profitability and steady revenue, the recent downward trend in price and the negative performance relative to the market need to be considered. Although some technical indicators point toward potential short-term upward movement, the long-term outlook depends on various factors, including the energy market, regulatory changes, and the company's strategic execution. The extraordinarily high projected return should be viewed with considerable skepticism.  Further research into the basis of that projection is necessary. Investors should proceed with caution and perform thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.
