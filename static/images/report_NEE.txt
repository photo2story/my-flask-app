While NEE showed a strong cumulative return of 83.04%, VOO achieved 108.62%, resulting in a -25.6% divergence.  This places NEE in the 18.6th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, based on a range of -52.1% to +90%. Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind this underperformance.

Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) is a leading clean energy company focused on electric utilities and renewable energy sources.

The provided data shows a substantial underperformance of NEE compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return difference (-25.6%) highlights this divergence.  The Alpha values suggest that NEE has generally underperformed the market (negative alpha in some periods), but the high Beta consistently shows it's sensitive to overall market movements.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.16
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.70

The price is above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term uptrend. However, it’s relatively close to the 60-day average, suggesting the trend might be less certain in the medium term.  The significant price increase from the previous close (+$4.03, ~5.75%) indicates a recent rapid upturn that requires investigation for potential triggers.

* **Relative Strength (20-day):** +9.5% (Short-term upward trend)

The RSI is nearing overbought levels, suggesting a potential correction might be due. The positive PPO confirms the bullish momentum, yet the high expected return warrants further scrutiny. The recent significant price increase needs further examination to identify driving factors behind this potential sharp rebound.

NEE has consistently exceeded or met EPS expectations in recent quarters, showcasing relatively strong earnings performance.  However, the most recent quarter's EPS is lower, and more data is needed to determine if this is a trend or an anomaly.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates across quarters but remains relatively high; Profit margins are consistently strong and above 55%, demonstrating good profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity is growing steadily; ROE is also variable but generally indicates reasonable returns on investment. The overall financial health appears sound, but the ROE variability should be explored to determine the factors influencing this fluctuation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE shows a mixed performance.  While its financial statements suggest robust profitability and steady growth in equity, its stock price underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period.  Recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations in most quarters.  However, the high expected long-term return needs further justification and deeper analysis of market factors impacting NEE's relative performance.  The recent price surge warrants careful investigation to identify the underlying causes.  Technical indicators suggest a possible short-term overbought condition, indicating potential price corrections.  Further research is needed to determine the long-term investment potential, considering the volatility and relative performance against the broader market.  A thorough examination of sector-specific factors, regulatory changes, and competitive landscape would enhance the analysis.
