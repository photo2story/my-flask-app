| 2023-2025  | -25.0%  | 76.1% | -91.0% | 0.4  | 165.7 |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR was strong in the 2017-2021 period but has significantly declined in recent years, showing negative returns for the 2021-2025 periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  MDD is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, which represents performance above the benchmark, is strongly negative in the most recent periods (2021-2025), indicating substantial underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta is relatively low, suggesting that NEE's price movements are less correlated with the overall market. This is somewhat contradictory, given its large drawdown percentages.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Cap in Billions):** The market cap fluctuated and decreased more recently, reflecting investor sentiment.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 79.54
*   **Previous Close:** 80.85
*   **Change:** -1.62
*   **5-day SMA:** 80.73
*   **20-day SMA:** 82.692
*   **60-day SMA:** 82.7649

The current price is below all the Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which could indicate a short-term downward trend.  The recent decline suggests bearish momentum.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 28.68 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.4476
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (11 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 3.5 (+) (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 80.8% (Long-term)

The RSI suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.  The PPO is negative, reflecting bearish momentum, but not extremely so. The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy recommendation (although MRI is lower than expected, which can be a confusion).  The positive change in relative divergence over the last 20 days suggests a potential short-term rebound.  The expected return of 80.8% suggests strong long-term potential, but should be weighed against the risks shown in previous data.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **AI Data Center Boom and EPS Growth:** Positive news highlighting growth opportunities.
*   **NRG vs. NEE Comparison:**  Suggests potential competition and need to evaluate relative attractiveness.
*   **How Good Has NEE Stock Actually Been?:** Potentially critical analysis of past performance, requiring further investigation.
*   **Massachusetts Battery Start-Up to List on Stock Exchange:** While not directly about NEE, it reflects the dynamic landscape of the renewable energy sector.
*   **UBS Lowers Price Target, Maintains Buy Rating:** Mixed signal – maintaining a "Buy" rating is positive, but a lowered price target suggests some concern.
*   **NEE and Exxon Major Project:** Could be a positive catalyst, but the stock fell after the announcement, requiring further investigation.

**4.2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.87)
*   **Opinions:** 21
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 91.05 / 103.00 / 56.00

The analyst consensus is a "Buy," with an average target price significantly above the current price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates some uncertainty among analysts. The lowered price target by UBS tempers this positive outlook.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

NextEra Energy (NEE) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Signals:** NEE has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, with negative CAGR, high MDD, and negative Alpha values over the last several years. The stock price is below key moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend.
*   **Positive Signals:** The stock appears oversold based on RSI.  There's an expected high long-term return (80.8%). Analyst consensus remains a "Buy," with a target price well above the current level. Recent relative divergence has increased, suggesting a potential short-term recovery. The news about AI data center growth and the Exxon project could act as positive catalysts.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **Volatility:** The high MDD indicates that NEE is a volatile investment.
    *   **Underperformance:**  The underperformance compared to the S&P 500 needs to be carefully considered.  Is it a temporary setback, or a sign of deeper issues?
    *   **Catalysts:** The potential for growth in AI data centers and the partnership with Exxon could be significant drivers of future performance.
    *   **Analyst Opinions:**  While the consensus is "Buy," the lowered price target and wide range in target prices suggest caution.
    *   **News:** Analyze the "How Good Has NEE Stock Actually Been?" article from The Motley Fool to better understand the past performance and future prospects. The drop in price after the Exxon announcement needs investigation to understand the market's reaction.

**Conclusion:**

NEE presents a potentially attractive long-term investment opportunity, particularly given the analyst consensus and expected return.  However, the high volatility, recent underperformance, and mixed news require careful consideration and further due diligence before making an investment decision. Investors should weigh the potential rewards against the risks and closely monitor the company's progress in capitalizing on growth opportunities. The current MRI indicates a medium investment rating. The RSI suggests it is oversold, while the hybrid signal suggests buying. This may be a good entry point.
