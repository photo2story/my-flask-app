## Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) Stock Review

This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE), a leading clean energy company, based on the provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return (71.45%) underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (82.57%) by 11.1 percentage points.  Considering the historical range of the relative divergence (max: 109.2, min: -31.1), the current -11.1% underperformance represents the 14.3rd percentile.  This indicates that NEE's relative performance is currently in the lower portion of its historical range against the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance relative to the market (Beta) and varying levels of outperformance (Alpha) over the years.  While exhibiting high CAGR in some periods (e.g., 2019-2021: 129%), recent years show negative returns (-63% in 2021-2023, -39% in 2022-2024).  Noteworthy is the substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the period.  The negative returns in the recent past may explain some of the underperformance relative to the S&P 500.

NEE's performance has been mixed. While it boasts strong revenue and profit margins, recent returns have lagged behind the S&P 500.

The extremely high projected long-term return requires careful review of its calculation methodology.  A deeper dive into the factors influencing the recent negative CAGR and the extremely high expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation is needed to ascertain whether the current underperformance is a temporary dip or a sign of longer-term challenges.
