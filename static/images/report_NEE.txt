## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) is a leading clean energy company.  As of the last data point, NEE's cumulative return (108.39%) lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (129.57%) by 21.2%.  This places its relative performance at the 19.8th percentile based on historical data (range: -50.8% to 98.4%).

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows consistent positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) across most periods, ranging from 1.1 to 1.6, indicating NEE has generally outperformed the market.  However, the Beta is consistently above 1, implying higher volatility than the overall market.  The significant negative CAGR (-4.3% and -3.0%) in the most recent periods (2021-2023 and 2022-2024) is concerning and warrants further investigation into the underlying factors.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values during those periods also reflect significant price declines.  The increase in Beta in the last two periods might signal increased sensitivity to market downturns.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Price:** $77.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $76.67
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $76.20
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $80.42

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The relatively close proximity of the 5-day and 20-day averages indicates some consolidation, while the gap to the 60-day average implies a more substantial pullback.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (65.79):**  Indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a near-term pullback.
* **PPO (0.49):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, though it's relatively low.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-7.6%):** Shows a recent downward trend in relative performance compared to the market.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  This suggests that at the current valuation, the market does not expect significant outperformance over the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon. This is likely impacted by the recent underperformance.  A 2-year plus horizon would require deeper analysis incorporating future growth projections and market conditions.  The current price ($77.49) doesn't indicate a dramatic recent event (no extreme price jump or crash).

**4. Recent Earnings & Forecasts:**

The earnings reports show mixed results.  While the actual EPS has generally exceeded the expected EPS, the trend is concerning. The most recent quarter (2024-10-23) shows a slight beat on EPS but is less impressive than previous periods, especially compared to the significant EPS beat during 2024-04-23. Further analysis is required to understand the reasons behind the fluctuation, considering macroeconomic conditions and sector-specific trends.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows:

* **Strong Revenue Growth:** Consistent high revenue growth.
* **Profit Margin Fluctuation:**  Slight variability in profit margins, potentially influenced by operational costs or market conditions.
* **Stable Equity:** Relatively stable equity levels.
* **ROE Fluctuation:** Return on Equity fluctuates, indicating variability in profitability relative to shareholder investments.

Further investigation into the drivers behind these fluctuations (e.g., cost of capital, debt levels, and market competitiveness) is recommended.

**7. Summary:**

NEE has historically shown strong performance, often outperforming the S&P 500, evidenced by its positive alpha. However, recent performance has been weak, with negative CAGR and high MDD in the latest reporting periods. While the financial statements show a strong revenue and profitability, its current relative performance is lagging. Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term pullback, but strong long-term fundamentals might warrant further investigation depending on the findings from the additional news and analyst opinion analysis in Section 6. The projected 0% expected return highlights the market's current uncertainty surrounding its near-term prospects.  A thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions.

Investment Recommendation:** (This section requires information from Section 6 to complete)  Based on the available data, a deeper dive into recent news, analyst opinions, and the underlying reasons for the recent underperformance is necessary before any investment recommendation can be made.  The mixed signals from financial performance, technical indicators and recent relative underperformance require more information.
