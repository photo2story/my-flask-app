**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE demonstrates strong financial fundamentals with consistently high profit margins and positive EPS.  However, the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 and recent negative CAGR figures raise concerns.  The conflicting signals from technical indicators (RSI nearing oversold, but PPO negative) and the relatively high beta suggest considerable market risk.  The high expected return projection needs careful consideration given the recent underperformance and market volatility.  Further due diligence, including a deeper analysis of the company's long-term growth prospects and the reasons for recent underperformance, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A cautious approach is recommended.
