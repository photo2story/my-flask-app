Given the underperformance, downtrend indicators, and caution signals, a conservative approach is warranted. Investors should closely monitor news, company announcements, and further financial data to assess the sustainability of recent trends. A potential buying opportunity may arise if the RSI enters oversold territory and is confirmed by other indicators.
