The negative PPO supports the short-term bearish view.
*   **Divergence:** The negative relative divergence change confirms the recent downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return (109.3%) suggests that the model anticipates a significant recovery and outperformance of the S&P 500 over a longer time horizon. This could be based on growth prospects related to renewable energy and infrastructure investments.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

NEE presents a mixed picture.

*   **Bearish Short-Term:** Technical indicators (price below moving averages, negative PPO, RSI approaching oversold) suggest short-term weakness and decline. Recent price action and short-term divergence support this.

*   **Risk Factors:** The divergence from the S&P 500, high MDD, and negative alpha in recent years suggest that NEE may be a higher-risk investment than the broader market. The negative divergence change confirms the recent downward trend.
*   **MRI Conclusion:** The MRI of 0.9 indicates this is a high investment opportunity, but investors need to do their own research as some negative indicators show that it may be a risky opportunity.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** Overall it is a buy as suggested by the Consensus and Hybrid Signal, and the MRI, but investors need to be cautious because there are a lot of negative indications on the short term, so investors need to be patient.
