## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Nextera Energy Inc (NEE), a leading clean energy company, has shown a cumulative return of 111.16% over the analyzed period.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%, NEE lags behind by 17.7 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -17.7% places it in the 22.2nd percentile of its historical range (max: 98.4%, min: -50.8%).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $78.52 (Last Market: $78.54)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $77.1
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $76.2
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $80.38

The price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential resistance level and suggesting a recent price decline. The slight difference between the closing price and the last market price suggests minimal price fluctuation immediately before market close.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.46 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.63 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This is a stated value and requires further justification or alternative analysis)

The RSI is approaching overbought levels, suggesting potential short-term price correction.  The positive PPO supports the upward momentum observed in the moving averages. The negative divergence change indicates a recent weakening of the upward trend. The stated expected return of 0.0% for long-term investment requires additional context and analysis, especially given the historical alpha values.  Without a clear methodology for this projection,  it should not be relied upon.  If the last market price of 78.54 were significantly higher (e.g., a sudden jump), it would suggest a potential sharp price increase or a market event impacting the price.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

NEE has exhibited solid growth historically, outperforming the S&P 500 in some periods, though it currently trails the market. While recent earnings have generally met or exceeded expectations, the short-term price action reveals potential for a pullback, given the RSI and relative divergence.  Long-term prospects depend heavily on the clean energy sector's continued growth and NEE's ability to maintain its competitive position.  The lack of recent news prevents a definitive outlook.  A thorough analysis requires examining the factors driving recent performance and comparing them to company guidance and industry trends.
