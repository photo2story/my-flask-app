**6) Overall Conclusion:**

NEE's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, although the projected long-term return is substantial.  However, the high market risk indicator, negative PPO, and recent volatility in price and financial metrics warrant caution.  The recent price jump needs investigation.  A thorough review of the underlying business conditions, future growth prospects, and a more detailed risk assessment is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high projected return is heavily dependent on future positive outcomes and may not be reliable.  Consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate risk.
