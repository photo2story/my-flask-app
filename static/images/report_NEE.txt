NEE has shown periods of strong performance, but recently underperformed the S&P 500. While the company's financial fundamentals remain relatively strong (high profit margins and growing equity), recent price action indicates a downward trend.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish outlook in the short term. The expected return of 0.0% over the long term, relative to the S&P 500, necessitates a cautious approach.  Further analysis of recent news, analyst opinions, and a deeper dive into the company's future growth prospects are crucial before making any investment decision.  The relatively low RSI suggests there may be potential for a bounce.  However, the low PPO and negative relative divergence warrant caution.
