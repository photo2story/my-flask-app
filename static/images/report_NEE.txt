## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Nextera Energy Inc (NEE), a leading clean energy company.  The following sections present key performance indicators and financial data, culminating in a comprehensive assessment of the stock's performance and future prospects.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) is a leading clean energy company focused on generating and delivering electricity.

* **NEE Cumulative Return:** 73.32%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 120.63%
* **Return Difference:** -47.3%  (NEE underperformed VOO significantly)
* **Relative Divergence Rank:** 3.4% (This indicates NEE's underperformance is relatively low compared to its historical range of underperformance against the S&P 500, considering the max and min divergence values)


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO). While exhibiting high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in some periods, recent years show substantial negative returns (-81%, -33%, -21%).  The beta values fluctuate, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.  High alpha values in some periods suggest outperformance, but this has not been consistent. The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over time suggests growth, despite recent volatility.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $69.27
* **Last Market Price:** $68.71 (a decrease of $0.81 or 1.17%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $70.20
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $72.87

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price drop of $0.81 represents a minor negative change, not indicative of a dramatic drop.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.06 (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, indicating a bearish trend)
* **PPO:** -0.0036 (Negative value, confirming the bearish trend)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 735.8% (This exceptionally high figure needs further clarification regarding its calculation and assumptions.  It is likely a projection with significant uncertainty).

The negative price change in the 'Last-market' data is relatively small and doesn't suggest a dramatic drop or sharp rebound. The extremely high expected return needs careful scrutiny.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

NEE's performance has been inconsistent, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 in recent years despite showing periods of strong growth and positive alpha.  Recent earnings have been positive, and financial metrics generally appear sound. However, the stock price is currently trending downwards, and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  The projected long-term expected return is exceptionally high and needs further justification.  A more in-depth analysis including a consideration of the company's future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors is required to form a well-informed investment decision. The extremely high projected return necessitates careful investigation into the underlying assumptions.
