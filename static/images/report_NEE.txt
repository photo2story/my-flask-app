## Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) Stock Review

**0. Overview:**

Nextera Energy Inc (NEE) is a leading clean energy company focused on electricity generation and distribution.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

NEE's cumulative return (79.10%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (118.31%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -39.2%, placing it in the 9.1st percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different years.  While alpha (market-beating return) shows some positive values, indicating periods of outperformance, the significant negative CAGR (-81%) and MDD (-104%) in 2021-2023 suggest significant risk.  The high beta values in recent years (0.5-0.6) indicate higher volatility and sensitivity to market movements compared to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $71.58
* **5-day Moving Average:** $69.47
* **20-day Moving Average:** $70.19
* **60-day Moving Average:** $71.83

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent upward momentum. However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance at higher price levels.  The last day's price increase (+2.05%) shows a sharp upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.09 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.30 (Slightly positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +7.8% (Indicates short-term upward trend)

The positive price change and upward momentum indicators suggest a recent short-term rally. However, the RSI being close to 50 indicates a lack of strong momentum.  The expected return of 240.5% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 seems exceptionally high and should be treated with extreme caution.  It's crucial to understand the underlying assumptions and risks associated with this projection.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|-------|--------------|------------|

| 2024-01-25 | 0.52  | 0.49         | 0.03       |

Generally, EPS has been exceeding expectations, except for the quarter ending July 2024. This positive surprise suggests the company is performing relatively well compared to analysts' forecasts.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE has shown periods of strong performance but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently.  While recent earnings have generally been positive, the high beta and recent significant negative CAGR indicate considerable risk.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return should be viewed with skepticism.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly positive short-term outlook, but the overall picture is one of considerable volatility and uncertainty.  Further investigation into the drivers of the 2021-2023 downturn is critical before making any investment decisions.  A thorough risk assessment is essential before investing in NEE.
