NEE shows a mixed performance. While its long-term expected return is high, recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, and the stock price is currently below its moving averages.  Profitability remains strong, as indicated by high profit margins.  However, the high Beta suggests significant volatility.  The current market risk indicators suggest medium risk.  A long-term investment strategy might be considered, but careful monitoring is crucial given the recent negative CAGR and the high volatility indicated by the high Beta and MDD.  Further analysis of the reasons for the recent underperformance is recommended before making any investment decisions.
