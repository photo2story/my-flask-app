### 7. 종합 분석 (Overall Analysis)

NEE has recently underperformed the S&P 500 and exhibits negative alpha in recent years, but it has a potentially very high long-term expected return. Recent news events indicate heightened activity around the stock, suggesting the need for careful monitoring. The company has consistently met or exceeded earnings expectations and maintains strong profit margins. However, ROE has been declining.

The MRI suggests low risk. The hybrid signal suggests taking a cautious stance. The current price is showing positive momentum, but is facing potential resistance at the 20 and 60-day moving averages.

**Recommendation:**

Given the underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the mixed signals from the indicators, a cautious approach is warranted. Investors should carefully weigh the potential high long-term return against the recent underperformance and declining ROE. Monitor news and company announcements closely, and consider the hybrid signal's recommendation to maintain a high cash position.
