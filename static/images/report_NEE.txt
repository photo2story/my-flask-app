### 7. 종합 결론

NextEra Energy (NEE) shows a mixed outlook. While it has consistently beaten EPS estimates and boasts high profit margins, it has underperformed the S&P 500 recently. The technical indicators suggest a potential for a short-term bounce, and the long-term expected return is attractive. However, the recent decline in performance relative to the S&P 500 and negative trends in CAGR and Alpha should be considered. Analyst ratings are generally positive, but price target adjustments are varied.

**Recommendation:** Given the high MRI and "Very Safe" Hybrid Signal along with consistently beating EPS estimates, a long-term investment strategy like monthly investing could be considered. However, due diligence is crucial due to recent underperformance and volatility.
