## Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) is a leading clean energy company.  Its recent performance shows underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with negative alpha and considerable price volatility. While financial health appears strong with high profit margins and substantial equity, recent price action indicates a potential short-term bearish trend.  Long-term prospects are linked to the continued growth of the clean energy sector, offset by potential regulatory risks.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NEE's cumulative return (52.99%) lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (65.78%) by 12.8%. This places it at the 17th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-35% to 95%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results. While CAGR has been impressive in some periods (reaching 115% from 2019-2021), the recent performance (2021-2025) exhibits significant negative returns (-64% and -41%).  Alpha is consistently positive, indicating some outperformance, however the magnitude of the recent negative CAGR is concerning. Beta is generally above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market. Market capitalization has generally increased over time.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $66.72
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $66.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $70.06

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price drop (-$1.27) should be noted.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 39.09 (Below 40, indicating oversold conditions, potentially suggesting a bounce, but this is not guaranteed)
* **PPO:** -0.73 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -5.7% (Short-term bearish trend)

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests bearish momentum.  However, the oversold RSI could signal a potential short-term rebound.

The expected return of 176.5% over the long term (2+ years) is significant and suggests a potential for outperformance relative to the S&P 500, however, this projection must be viewed with caution given the recent volatility.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NEE displays strong financial fundamentals with consistently high profit margins and significant equity.

Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend, although oversold conditions may indicate a potential short-term bounce. The long-term outlook is contingent on the continued growth of the clean energy sector and successful management of regulatory challenges.  While the expected long-term return is high, the significant recent underperformance and volatility should be considered.  Further research is needed to assess the risk-reward profile fully.
