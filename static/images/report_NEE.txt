**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data reveals inconsistent EPS performance relative to expectations.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information.  The prompt didn't provide any recent news or analyst opinions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE presents a mixed picture.  While it shows a generally positive financial profile and long-term expected return, the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and inconsistent EPS performance are concerning.

More information, especially on revenue growth trends and recent news, would be crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.  The large projected long-term return warrants further investigation into underlying assumptions and risks. The consistent zero alpha in historical data warrants further investigation into the market correlation.  The significant fluctuations in CAGR highlights periods of both outperformance and underperformance.
