## Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Nextera Energy Inc. (NEE) is a leading clean energy company.  Over the period analyzed, NEE's cumulative return (104.07%) lagged behind the S&P 500's return (124.78%) by 20.71 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -20.71% places it in the 20.15th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating underperformance compared to its historical context.  However, the provided data doesn't specify the time frame for this cumulative return calculation, which is crucial for a proper interpretation.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  Alpha represents the excess return compared to the benchmark (S&P 500), while beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market.  The fluctuating alpha indicates inconsistent outperformance compared to the market, and the high beta consistently suggests significant market sensitivity.  The significant negative CAGR in the recent 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods is concerning.

It's crucial to conduct a deeper analysis incorporating recent news, analyst ratings, and a more thorough understanding of the long-term growth prospects and risk factors before considering any investment.
