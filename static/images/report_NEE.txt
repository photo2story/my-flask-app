The provided EPS data shows some fluctuation. While there were beats in Q1 2024, Q2 2024 and Q3 2024, there was a miss in Q2 2024.

A complete analysis of revenue growth trends and revenue is needed for a comprehensive view of the company's financial health.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news is provided. Information on market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights is absent.  This significantly limits the depth of the analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NEE's performance has lagged the S&P 500 in the past year, although recent quarters saw increased earnings.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, hinting at a potential short-term rebound.  However, the lack of recent news and a detailed analysis of revenue growth trends prevents a stronger conclusion. Long-term accumulation investment might be considered cautiously, acknowledging the potential for underperformance relative to the broader market.
