* **60-Day Moving Average:** $93.02

The price is above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term uptrend. However, it's below its 60-day moving average, suggesting potential resistance at higher levels.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Walmart (WMT) has demonstrated significant historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, the recent sharp price increase and high market risk indicator suggest caution.  While the financial statements reveal consistent revenue and stable profitability, the short-term price action warrants careful monitoring.  Further investigation is required to clarify the duplicated earnings data and the unusually high alpha values presented in the analysis.  The projected long-term outperformance (3.9% expected return relative to S&P 500) should be considered alongside the inherent risks indicated by the high market risk indicator.  A thorough evaluation of current macroeconomic conditions and potential future market headwinds is crucial before making any investment decisions.
