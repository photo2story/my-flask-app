## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores.

The cumulative return of WMT (190.77%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (118.37%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 72.4%, placing it at the 90.6th percentile of the historical relative divergence (max: 82.9%, min: -28.5%).  This indicates WMT's strong outperformance relative to the broader market during this time.  The provided Alpha values of consistently near zero suggest that this outperformance is not attributable to any unique managerial skill, but rather to market factors or sector-specific trends that favored WMT over the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $91.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $91.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.6155
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $89.0517

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent price stability or minor upward momentum.  It is also significantly above the 60-day moving average indicating a recent price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.94  (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.1658 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.5% (Recent short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1.1%  (This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment).  Given the already strong historical outperformance, a modest future excess return is suggested.  The relatively low expected return may be a reflection of the current valuation of WMT already incorporating much of its anticipated future growth.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue          |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| 2024-12-06 | $0.57  | $168.00 Billion |
| 2024-08-30 | $0.56  | $167.77 Billion |

| 2024-12-06 | $0.06  | $159.44 Billion | *(Note: This appears to be a duplicate entry or an error.  One of the December 6th entries should be verified.)*


Revenue shows relative stability around $160-$170 Billion.  EPS fluctuates, but generally shows a positive trend, except for the outlier in November 2023 and a potential duplication in December 2024.  Further investigation is needed to clarify the inconsistency in the December 2024 data.

**5. Financial Information:**

| Quarter     | Revenue      | Profit Margin |

| 2024-07-31 | $169.34B     | 25.11%        |

| 2023-10-31 | $160.80B     | 24.64%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity       | ROE     |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| 2024-10-31 | $88.11B      | 5.19%   |
| 2024-07-31 | $84.42B      | 5.33%   |

| 2023-10-31 | $79.46B      | 0.57%   |

Equity is steadily increasing, with ROE showing some fluctuation but generally positive, except for a significant drop in Q4 2023.  The reasons for this drop should be investigated.


**7.  Overall Analysis:**

Walmart has demonstrated strong historical performance exceeding the S&P 500.  While recent technical indicators suggest some short-term bearishness, the company's fundamentals appear relatively solid with consistent revenue and healthy profit margins.  However, there are inconsistencies in the provided earnings data requiring further investigation.  The relatively modest projected long-term excess return over the S&P 500 suggests the market may have already priced in much of the future growth potential. A thorough review of the inconsistencies in the earnings data is crucial before making any investment decisions.
