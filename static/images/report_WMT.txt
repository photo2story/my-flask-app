## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.

The cumulative return of WMT (194.12%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (112.20%).  The difference in cumulative returns is 81.9%, placing it at the 99.1th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (based on a minimum divergence of -28.5% and a maximum of 82.9%).  This indicates a substantially higher return for WMT compared to the broader market over the measured period.  The consistently negative alpha values in the provided data suggest that the outperformance is not entirely attributable to systematic market risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $93.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $91.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $92.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $88.19

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a more sustained positive trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.83  (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet there)
* **PPO:** -0.28 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.8% (Positive, indicating recent short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** 0.8% (This is a very low long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500. The provided number should be clarified, as a 0.8% is unrealistically low given the previous analysis of strong outperformance)

The current price of $93.00 doesn't show any evidence of a sharp price increase or decrease.  The indicators provide a mixed signal; while the recent relative divergence is positive, the PPO is negative and the RSI is relatively low.  The low expected return of 0.8% warrants further investigation, particularly its methodology and the time horizon it applies to.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue          |
|------------|--------|-----------------|

Revenue has remained relatively stable, with some slight quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. EPS shows some volatility, with a notable spike in Q2 2024. Further investigation is needed to understand the discrepancies and the repeated 2024-12-06 entry. Clarification on which EPS number represents which quarter will be needed.

| 2023-10-31   | $79.46B     | 0.57%         |

Equity is growing steadily. ROE shows some fluctuation, with a significant drop in Q4 2023 which needs further investigation to determine the underlying causes.


**7. Overall Summary:**

Walmart (WMT) has shown significantly stronger performance than the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.  While recent technical indicators provide a mixed signal, the strong historical performance and generally healthy financial fundamentals suggest a relatively strong position.  However, the very low projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 needs further investigation and clarification.  Further analysis is needed to address inconsistencies in the earnings data and explore the reasons for the low ROE in Q4 2023 and the low stated expected return.  Considering the historical data and the positive price momentum, the currently provided 0.8% projected return seems unusually low and requires further investigation.  More data and a better understanding of the source data are needed to reach robust conclusions.
