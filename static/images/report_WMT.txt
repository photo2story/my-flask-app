| 2017-2019  | 59.0% | 56.9% | 40.0% | 0.1 | 298.1 |
| 2018-2020  | 16.0% | 70.7% | -18.0% | 0.1 | 367.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $85.63
* **Last Market Price:** $86.88
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $85.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $93.71

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent increase from the previous close ($85.15 to $86.88) indicates a small, but positive, price movement.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 34.46 (Approaching oversold territory; below 30 would signal oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.0182 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.3 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 9.8% (above S&P 500)

The combination of a relatively low RSI, negative PPO, and negative recent relative divergence suggests a bearish short-term outlook.  However, the positive expected return indicates potential long-term growth exceeding the S&P 500. The recent price increase needs to be considered in conjunction with the other bearish indicators.  A sudden jump in price without fundamental support warrants caution.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue          |
|------------|-------|-------------------|

Note: There seems to be a duplicate entry for 2024-12-06.  Assuming the first entry is correct, revenue is relatively stable, but EPS shows some fluctuation.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reason for the differing EPS figures, which may reflect accounting changes or other unusual circumstances.

**6. Overall Assessment:**

Walmart's long-term performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500,  demonstrated by its high cumulative return and positive (although fluctuating) alpha. Recent earnings show relatively stable revenue,  but EPS requires further clarification.  Short-term technical indicators point to a bearish outlook, but the long-term expected return remains positive.  The company’s financial position appears strong, with consistent revenue and healthy profit margins.  Investors should carefully consider the short-term bearish signals while recognizing the potential for long-term outperformance relative to the broader market.  Further investigation into the discrepancies in EPS data and a deeper dive into the company’s fundamentals are recommended before making investment decisions.
