The discrepancy in the last entry with two entries on 2024-08-30 needs clarification.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart demonstrates strong historical relative performance against the S&P 500.  However, current technical indicators suggest a potential short-term pullback.

The volatility in EPS and ROE warrants further investigation.
