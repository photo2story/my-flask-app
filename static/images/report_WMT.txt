**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Walmart Inc. (WMT) is a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.

The cumulative return of WMT (189.16%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (117.62%).  The difference is 71.5%, placing it at the 89.8th percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500 based on the provided data.

* **Closing Price:** $91.43
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $90.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $92.82
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $87.58

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The proximity to the 5-day average indicates recent price stabilization.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (39.07):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.

* **Expected Return (1.0%):**  A modest 1% expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a potential for modest outperformance, but this is based on limited historical data and future performance is uncertain.  The current price of $91.43 does not, in itself, suggest a significant event (such as a sharp rebound or drop) based solely on the given data. More context is needed.
