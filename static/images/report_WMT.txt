WMT has shown strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action shows a slight dip, the longer-term trend remains positive.

The provided data suggests that a long-term investment in WMT may offer a modest outperformance relative to the S&P 500, provided the stated expected return of 1% proves accurate.  However, further due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The unusual Alpha values necessitate a verification of the calculation methodology.
