**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate 2024-12-06 entries).  Analyzing the unique entries:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has remained relatively stable, fluctuating around $160B-$170B across the reported quarters. While there's a slight downward trend, it's not significantly dramatic.
* **EPS:** EPS shows volatility.  There's a substantial drop in EPS from Q2 2024 ($0.63) to Q3 2024 ($0.56) and then to Q4 2024 ($0.57). This requires further investigation into the underlying causes.  The substantial difference between reported EPS values indicates potential variability.

**Without complete and consistent data, a comprehensive analysis of earnings beats or misses against expectations is impossible.**


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows slight fluctuations, while profit margins are relatively stable around 24-25%, suggesting consistent profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally increased over the reported period. ROE is volatile, with a significant drop in Q4 2023 followed by improvement in subsequent quarters, indicating variable profitability. The substantial change in ROE from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 needs further explanation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Information on market outlook is also missing.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WMT has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. However, recent technical indicators (RSI) suggest the stock is overbought, and PPO indicates bearish momentum. While revenue has remained relatively stable, EPS volatility raises concerns.  Profitability margins are generally consistent.  More information is needed regarding recent news, analyst opinions, and a complete earnings analysis to fully assess the current situation and potential future performance.  The substantial discrepancy in the provided earnings data necessitates clarification to provide a robust analysis. The high CAGR suggests past periods of remarkable outperformance, but the current indicators suggest potential for a short-term correction. The long-term expected return remains positive,  but the volatile EPS needs to be examined further.
