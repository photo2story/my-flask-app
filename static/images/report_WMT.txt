## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Walmart Inc. (WMT) is a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.

Over the period analyzed, WMT's cumulative return (198.99%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (120.91%).  The difference is 78.1%, placing it at the 97th percentile of historical divergence from the S&P 500 based on the provided data. This suggests a strong relative performance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently shows near zero, indicating the outperformance is not significantly explained by market risk (beta), but likely driven by company-specific factors.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $94.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $94.336
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.4705
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $84.962

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average and above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent slight pullback after a period of upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.05 –  Indicates the stock is in moderately overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction.
* **PPO:** -0.14 – Suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -3.0 – Shows a recent slight downward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 16.0% –  A long-term (2+ years) investment in WMT is expected to yield 16% above the S&P 500 return.  This high expected return needs to be viewed in the context of the high current relative valuation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue generally shows a slightly increasing trend, with some minor quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.  However, there's no consistent upward or downward trend readily observable.
* **EPS:** EPS has been relatively stable, with some fluctuations.  Noteworthy is the significant drop in EPS from Q1 2024 ($0.63) to Q4 2023 ($0.17), followed by a partial recovery. The final reported EPS for Q4 2024 is $0.57, but there is an additional entry for $0.06 which seems like an error. I have omitted it from any further calculations.

There's insufficient information to compare against expectations without access to analyst estimates. The table needs to have consistent EPS data and correct data for accurate trend analysis.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable over the last five quarters, hovering around $160B-$170B. Profit margins are consistently high and generally stable in the range of 24-25%, with a slight dip in Q1 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has increased steadily over the period.  ROE shows fluctuations, with a significant drop in Q4 2023 and subsequent recovery.  This variation needs further investigation for a complete analysis.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to be completed.  Without this data, no comment can be made.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

WMT has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, indicated by a substantial positive divergence. While recent technical indicators hint at potential short-term corrections (overbought RSI and negative PPO), the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by the high expected return (16% above the S&P 500).  However, this needs to be considered alongside the current high valuation relative to the market.  The recent earnings data showcases some volatility in EPS, requiring more context and data for a thorough interpretation.  Further analysis of recent news, analyst opinions, and a full accounting of the potentially erroneous EPS data are needed for a more complete picture.  The high divergence needs to be viewed within the context of the wider market conditions, economic factors, and sector performance.
