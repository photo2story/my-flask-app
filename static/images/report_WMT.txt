**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $85.98
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $86.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $90.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $94.10

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates recent price stability.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 23.68 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.54 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +1.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 3.1% (This is an *excess* return over the S&P 500,  meaning WMT is expected to outperform the market by this amount over the long term. The reliability of this estimate depends on the underlying model used for projection and should be considered cautiously).

The price increase of $0.47 from the previous close is not significant enough to be classified as a sudden jump.  The conflicting signals from the RSI and PPO suggest caution.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Walmart (WMT) has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly. However, recent price action suggests a potential downtrend, supported by the price being below its moving averages and a bearish PPO.  The RSI suggests oversold conditions, possibly indicating a short-term bounce.  The companyâ€™s financial health appears strong, with stable revenue and profit margins.  The high Alpha values reported need further verification.  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry), the methodology used for calculating alpha, and the reliability of the long-term return projection is crucial.  A thorough risk assessment should be conducted given the conflicting signals from various indicators.
