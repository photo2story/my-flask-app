**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.

WMT significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a cumulative return more than double that of the index.  The relative divergence metric of 100% indicates that the current difference between WMT and VOO's returns is the maximum observed throughout the historical data.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows fluctuating performance relative to the market (Beta) and varying degrees of outperformance (Alpha).  While some periods show substantial Alpha (e.g., 2017-2019, 2022-2024, 2023-2025), other periods exhibit negative or lower Alpha, highlighting the volatility of WMT's performance relative to the market benchmark. The high CAGR in certain periods demonstrates significant growth potential but needs to be contextualized within the market conditions.  Note the significant market capitalization growth over the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $102.85
* **Last Market Price:** $102.14
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $100.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $95.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $92.35

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, indicating recent strength.  However, it's significantly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential overbought condition. The small recent price drop may be a minor correction.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 95.29 (Extremely overbought, suggesting potential for a pullback)
* **PPO:** 0.81 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) (Minor recent downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1.0% (This represents a low expected outperformance over the S&P 500, if the recent relative divergence doesn't widen substantially in the long term)


The high RSI value coupled with the negative relative divergence change and recent price drop indicates a potential short-term correction is likely.  The relatively small recent price change (-$0.69) doesn't suggest a significant sudden drop or rebound.  The long-term expected return is relatively low, suggesting caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue          |

| 2024-12-06 | $0.06 | $159.44 Billion  | *(Note: Possible duplicate entry or error)*


Revenue remains relatively consistent, though there's some fluctuation.  EPS shows some variability, with a notable drop in November 2023 followed by a subsequent increase.  The data needs clarification regarding the duplicate entry for December 6th, 2024.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity        | ROE     |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| 2024-10-31 | $88.11 Billion | 5.19%   |
| 2024-07-31 | $84.42 Billion | 5.33%   |

| 2024-01-31 | $83.86 Billion | 6.55%   |
| 2023-10-31 | $79.46 Billion | 0.57%   |

Equity is steadily increasing.  ROE shows some fluctuation, with higher values in Q1 and Q2 2024, suggesting improved profitability.  The significant drop in ROE for Q4 2023 needs further investigation.



**6. Overall Analysis:**

WMT has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent technical indicators (high RSI) suggest a potential short-term correction.  While the long-term expected return is low,  the companyâ€™s consistently high revenue and generally stable profit margins indicate financial health. Further analysis of the inconsistencies in the provided earnings data and the significant drop in ROE in Q4 2023 are necessary for a more complete assessment.  The high relative divergence suggests a potential for continued outperformance, but caution is warranted due to the overbought conditions indicated by the RSI and the potential for a correction.  Thorough fundamental analysis is recommended before making any investment decisions.
