## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

This report analyzes Walmart Inc. (WMT), a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores worldwide.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Walmart's cumulative return of 203.59% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's return of 122.19% over the analyzed period.  The difference is 81.4 percentage points, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This suggests strong outperformance relative to the broader market. The provided Alpha values consistently show near zero, suggesting the outperformance is not due to significant market-beating skill (alpha), but likely due to other factors like lower beta.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently low or zero alpha across all periods, suggesting the returns are largely explained by market movements (beta).  The beta values fluctuate, indicating varying sensitivity to market fluctuations over time.  High CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures are mostly offset by negative alpha and significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) suggesting good absolute performance, but lack of market-beating alpha. The substantial increase in CAGR from 2022-2024 could also point to better performance in a higher volatility market.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires access to real-time news sources and analyst reports to provide insights on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions.  The provided data lacks such current information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart shows strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, particularly over the most recent period. However,  its consistent near-zero alpha suggests that this outperformance is largely tied to market movements rather than unique company-specific factors. The high RSI indicates the stock may be overbought in the short term, while the positive PPO suggests continued upward momentum.  The provided earnings data reveals inconsistencies and volatility requiring further investigation to determine the underlying trends.  Long-term investment may still be considered given the generally strong financials and high predicted return.  However, investors should carefully monitor the company's earnings reports, news, and market sentiment before making any investment decisions.  The absence of recent news and analyst opinions limits the completeness of this analysis.
