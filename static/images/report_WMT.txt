The table shows inconsistent Alpha and Beta values across different periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others show negative alpha.  Beta generally hovers around 0.1-0.5 indicating lower than average market volatility relative to the S&P 500.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is highly variable, highlighting the market's influence on WMT's performance over time.  **More data is needed to reliably assess the alpha and beta statistics and draw conclusive insights.**

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-12-06 | 0.57 | $168.00 B     |

| 2024-12-06 | 0.06 | $159.44 B     |

**There's a duplicate entry for 2024-12-06.**  Assuming this is an error, revenue seems relatively stable, with slight fluctuations. EPS shows some variation, but further analysis (e.g., comparing to previous years) is needed to determine whether it shows a trend.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $169.59B   | 24.91%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $169.34B   | 25.11%        |

| 2024-01-31 | $173.39B   | 23.97%        |
| 2023-10-31 | $160.80B   | 24.64%        |

Revenue is relatively consistent with minor fluctuations. Profit margins are also fairly stable, ranging from 23.97% to 25.11%.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE          |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $88.11B    | 5.19%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $84.42B    | 5.33%        |

| 2023-10-31 | $79.46B    | 0.57%        |

Equity shows a steady increase, while ROE fluctuates but is generally positive, indicating profitability.  The significant drop in ROE in 2023-10-31 warrants further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

WMT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial difference in cumulative returns.  However, the alpha and beta analysis shows inconsistent results. Recent price action shows a short-term bullish trend, but the RSI suggests potential overbought conditions.  Earnings and financial information reveal stable revenue and profit margins, although the EPS shows some volatility, and the ROE experienced a sharp decline in Q4 2023.  A 1.2% excess return over the S&P 500 is predicted over the long term.  More detailed analysis, including comparison to historical data, industry benchmarks, and macroeconomic factors, is necessary to make a well-informed investment decision.  The inconsistent data points in the provided data need further verification.
