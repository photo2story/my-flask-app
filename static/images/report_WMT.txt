Walmart (WMT) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, boasting a cumulative return more than double that of the index. The relative divergence of 98.4% highlights this substantial outperformance relative to its historical performance against the VOO.  However,  it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows variable alpha and beta values across different time periods.  While alpha values generally suggest some degree of outperformance (positive alpha),  the beta values indicate varying levels of market sensitivity.  Higher beta suggests higher volatility relative to the market. The significant increase in CAGR from 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 suggests a period of strong performance, potentially related to factors like post-pandemic recovery and inflation-driven consumer behavior changes. The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values in some periods indicate substantial risk.


**Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price of $94.96 is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting some upward momentum.  The price is significantly higher than the 20-day moving average, indicating a stronger upward trend over the longer term. The recent price change of $0.12 represents a minimal daily change and doesn't signal a significant upward or downward trend.

**Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (58.35):** This value suggests a neutral market condition, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (1.06):** A positive PPO indicates positive momentum, suggesting a bullish trend.
* **MRI (0.4174):** Indicates a medium-risk level, suggesting caution but not necessarily a bearish signal.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-0.3):** This indicates a recent slight decrease in the relative strength of WMT compared to the VOO.

**Conclusion:**

Walmart has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500. While current indicators suggest a relatively neutral to positive outlook, investors should carefully consider the historical volatility and the inherent risks associated with any investment. The projected 4.0% long-term excess return over the S&P 500 warrants further investigation but should be viewed cautiously, given that it is a projection and past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.  A thorough examination of current market conditions and Walmart's fundamentals is necessary before making any investment decisions.
