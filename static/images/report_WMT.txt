*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 104.5005
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 102.2803

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently slightly below the 60-day moving average and below the 20-day moving average, but above the 5-day moving average. This suggests a potential short-term upward trend, but the price is still below medium-term levels. The lack of change in the last market price may indicate a period of consolidation or uncertainty.

### 3. Technical Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)

*   **Expected Return:** 4.5% (Long-term, S&P 500 Relative Outperformance)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation. The RSI is in oversold territory, which can signal a potential buying opportunity. The negative PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average. The hybrid signal further supports a buy recommendation. The recent decline in relative divergence suggests a short-term weakness in WMT compared to the S&P 500.  The 4.5% expected return is an estimate of long-term outperformance versus the S&P 500, if investing at current price.

The fact that the last market data shows no change may also be indicative of a stable day for the stock.
