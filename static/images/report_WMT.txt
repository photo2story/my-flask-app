**6. Overall Conclusion:**

WMT has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action shows some short-term bearishness, the long-term outlook remains positive, supported by consistent revenue, high profit margins, and a positive expected return.  However,  investors should monitor the recent EPS volatility and RSI levels, which are approaching overbought territory. A deeper dive into the reasons behind the EPS fluctuations and a broader macroeconomic analysis would provide a more comprehensive investment decision.  The 4.4% expected return suggests potential for long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this is only an estimate and subject to market risks.
