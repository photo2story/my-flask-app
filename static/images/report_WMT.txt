The long-term outlook, based on the provided data, is positive, with an expected return exceeding that of the S&P 500; however, a deeper dive into the inconsistencies in the data is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  Additional factors, such as macroeconomic conditions and industry trends, should also be considered for a complete investment decision.
