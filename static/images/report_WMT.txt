* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -20.5% (Significant short-term downward movement in relative strength)

The combination of low RSI and negative PPO indicates bearish short-term sentiment. The significant negative change in relative divergence confirms this short term bearish momentum. The relatively small expected return should be cautiously interpreted considering the historical performance variations (as reflected in the alpha and beta values).

**6. Overall Analysis:**

WMT has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend. While the long-term outlook (2+ years) shows a small expected excess return over the market, this should be considered cautiously due to the substantial variability shown in past performance.  The inconsistencies in the EPS data and the sharp drop in ROE in Q4 2023 require further investigation.  A more thorough analysis including a deeper dive into the financial statements and industry comparisons is needed for a complete and confident assessment of WMT's investment prospects.  The potential data errors in the earnings data require validation before drawing strong conclusions about the company's financial health.
