## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Analysis

**0) Executive Summary:**

Walmart Inc. (WMT), a multinational retail corporation, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period, exhibiting substantially higher cumulative returns. While recent performance shows signs of slowing, strong earnings and relatively stable financial health suggest continued potential, though risk assessment warrants consideration.


**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **Walmart (WMT):** Cumulative Return = 161.74%
* **S&P 500 (VOO):** Cumulative Return = 65.78%
* **Return Difference:** 96.0%  (Relative Divergence: 98.6%, indicating WMT's performance is at the 98.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.)

This demonstrates that WMT significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  However, it's crucial to understand that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  While alpha generally indicates outperformance (positive values), the fluctuating values suggest the market's influence on WMT's returns is not consistent.  High beta values (especially in 2015-2017) indicate higher sensitivity to market movements. The consistently high CAGR figures, however, show robust growth across the periods.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values in certain periods signal considerable risk associated with WMT investment.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $85.80
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $86.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $93.03

The price is above the short-term moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting potential short-term upward momentum but a longer-term trend that may need further monitoring.  The recent price increase of $1.13 (from $89.60) indicates a moderate upward movement.

* **RSI:** 58.19 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.754 (Suggests potential bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +7.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 3.6% (Long-term S&P 500 outperformance)


The indicators paint a mixed picture. The RSI and MRI suggest a relatively neutral to moderately risky environment, while the PPO and relative divergence indicate positive short-term momentum. The expected return is positive, although this is a forecast and not a guarantee.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Walmart (WMT) has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting a high cumulative return. While recent performance indicates a potential slowing, the company's consistent revenue, high profit margins, and generally positive financial indicators suggest long-term potential.  However,  the significant MDD in several periods highlights considerable risk.  Further analysis of the seemingly duplicated earnings data is recommended, as is an assessment of the competitive landscape and potential future headwinds before making any investment decisions.  The expected return of 3.6% over the S&P 500 should be viewed cautiously as a projection and not a guarantee.
