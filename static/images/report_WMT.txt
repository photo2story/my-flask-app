## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

This report analyzes Walmart Inc. (WMT), a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Walmart's cumulative return (184.64%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (113.65%).  The difference is 71.0%, placing it in the 89.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. This indicates strong relative performance.  The provided Alpha values consistently near zero suggest that Walmart's returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta), lacking significant independent performance (Alpha).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $90.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $91.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $93.18
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $87.21

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (31.31):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.87):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (-2.7):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (1.0%):**  A 1% expected return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is quite low and suggests modest outperformance at best. This figure is a key factor to consider, as it implies the current price may be inflated to justify the large cumulative return.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (two entries for 2024-12-06).  Analyzing only the unique entries:

* **Revenue:** Revenue generally shows a slight increase over the quarters, with a small dip in Q4 2023.  However, revenue is fairly stable around the $160B-$170B range.
* **EPS:** EPS exhibits significant volatility.  There's a sharp drop from Q2 2024 to Q4 2023. Subsequently, EPS fluctuates above $0.50 except for Q4 2023.
* **Significant Changes:** The drop in EPS in Q4 2023 is notable, requiring further investigation beyond the given data. Without expectations data, we cannot determine beats or misses.  Inconsistencies in the reported data prevent a more thorough analysis.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable over the past five quarters. Profit margin fluctuates slightly, but remains consistently above 23%.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has shown a steady increase, except for a slight dip in one quarter. ROE also fluctuates, with a significant decline in Q4 2023, mirroring the EPS trend. The drop in ROE in Q4 2023 is noteworthy and warrants further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or market outlook information was provided.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also unavailable.  The lack of recent news is a major constraint in a holistic analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart shows a historically strong relative performance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downward trend.  While the company shows relatively stable revenue and generally healthy profit margins, inconsistencies in the reported earnings data and the low projected long-term return, combined with a lack of recent news, necessitate caution.  The significant decline in EPS and ROE in Q4 2023 warrants further investigation to determine the underlying reasons.  Overall, additional information is needed for a comprehensive assessment of Walmart's current outlook and investment potential. The strong historical performance against the S&P 500 is overshadowed by concerns regarding recent earnings and the low expected future return.
