## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.  The cumulative return of WMT (183.8%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (125.68%). The difference is 58.12%, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500.  This indicates superior historical performance relative to the market benchmark.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha across all periods, suggesting WMT has outperformed the market (as measured by the S&P 500).  Beta values hover around 0.6, indicating lower volatility compared to the overall market.  However, it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.  The substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth over the analyzed period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Close:** $87.18
* **5-day Moving Average:** $85.32
* **20-day Moving Average:** $83.75
* **60-day Moving Average:** $80.99

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  However, the relatively high RSI (see below) might indicate the stock is becoming overbought.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 76.71 (Overbought territory; above 70 suggests potential overbought conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.2 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** 0.0 (-)  (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return:** 0.01% (This needs more context. Is this the expected annual return?  It appears low considering the historical outperformance.)

The 0.01% long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 seems incongruent with its historical outperformance, warranting further investigation into the model used for this projection.  The fact that the current price ($87.19) is near its high implies no recent dramatic price jump (no evidence of a significant "rapid jump").


**4. Recent Financials and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and has duplicate entries.  To provide a proper analysis, accurate and complete data is required.  Including earnings estimates would provide a more insightful comparison and perspective on the company's performance.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Shows consistent high revenue and healthy profit margins, though there is some fluctuation quarter-over-quarter.

* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity is growing, but ROE shows considerable variability, indicating potential challenges in consistently maintaining high profitability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* *This section requires information about recent news articles (within the last two days) from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD, concerning WMT's earnings and market outlook.  Analysis of analyst opinions and performance highlights will require these news sources.*

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart demonstrates a strong historical track record of outperforming the S&P 500, indicated by a consistently positive alpha.  However, recent technical indicators (high RSI) suggest a potential overbought condition.  The low projected long-term return needs clarification and further investigation into the underlying model and assumptions.  A thorough analysis of the most recent earnings and the accompanying news coverage, coupled with consistent and accurate financial data, is essential to formulate a more robust assessment of WMT's current standing and future potential.

**8. Recommendations:**

Further research is needed before making any investment recommendations.  Investors should consider the following:

* **Clarify the inconsistency in the provided earnings data.**  Obtain accurate and complete financial statements.
* **Investigate the 0.01% expected return projection.**  Understand the methodology and assumptions behind this forecast.
* **Review recent news and analyst reports.**  Assess the current market sentiment and future outlook for WMT.
* **Consider risk tolerance.**  While WMT has shown historical strength, no investment is without risk.


This report serves as a preliminary assessment.  A comprehensive analysis requires more accurate and complete data and further investigation into recent market events and analyst opinions.
