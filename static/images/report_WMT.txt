**6. Overall Analysis:**

WMT has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent price action shows a downward trend.  While the long-term outlook suggests a potential 2% outperformance over the S&P 500,  the current bearish technical indicators (RSI, PPO, negative divergence) and the recent sharp price drop warrant caution.  Further investigation is needed to determine the reasons behind the recent price decline.  A thorough examination of the duplicate earnings data, comparison to prior year earnings data, and a more in-depth analysis of macroeconomic factors impacting the retail sector is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The historical high MDD values highlight the significant risk involved in investing in WMT.
