## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores worldwide.

The cumulative return for WMT is 199.69%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 122.16%.  The difference is 77.5%, placing it at the 95.2nd percentile of historical divergence based on the provided data (max 82.9%, min -28.5%). This indicates a substantially higher return compared to the benchmark over the analyzed period.  The alpha consistently shows near zero, suggesting that its performance isn't significantly exceeding the market's overall performance after accounting for its beta.  However, the exceptionally high cumulative return over the analyzed period is notable.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $94.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $93.36
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $89.80

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.01 (from $93.81) indicates a minor but positive daily change.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 72.67 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.2553 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +4.6% (Short-term upward momentum)

The RSI nearing 70 suggests the stock might be overbought, potentially signaling a near-term correction. However, the positive PPO and short-term relative divergence indicate continued upward momentum. The daily price change reflects a mild positive trend. The expected return of 1.0% is likely a short-term estimate.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy would likely deliver a higher return exceeding that of the S&P 500 based on the significant historical outperformance seen, though it's important to note this is not guaranteed and relies on the assumption that past performance is indicative of future results.
