## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores worldwide.

The cumulative return of WMT (199.95%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (120.40%).  The difference is 79.5%, placing it at the 98.3rd percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates WMT has substantially outperformed the market benchmark over the measured period.

The provided alpha values are consistently near zero, suggesting that the stock's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta).  While the beta varies across the periods, it generally indicates a relatively high sensitivity to market fluctuations. The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values in some periods demonstrate periods of strong growth but the recent 2021-2023 period saw minimal growth and 2022-2024  shows extremely high growth.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $94.55
* **5-day Moving Average:** $94.77
* **20-day Moving Average:** $90.05
* **60-day Moving Average:** $84.17

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downward trend. However, it is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a positive longer-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (79.29):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback is likely.
* **PPO (0.23):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-1.7%):**  Shows a recent slight decrease in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (15.4%):** This represents a substantial potential outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if the current trend continues.  The closing price of 94.57 is not significantly different enough to suggest a sudden dramatic market event.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue. Revenue generally shows growth except for a decrease between the June and November 2023 quarters. While the EPS increased between several periods, there was a significant decrease from Q2 2024 (June) and Q3 2024 (August), followed by an increase in Q4 2024 (December).  There is insufficient data to assess beats or misses relative to expectations.  The data shows inconsistent trends and requires further context to provide a complete analysis.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue is relatively stable, though there's some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter.  The slight dip in Q1 2024 is notable.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are consistently high and show little significant variation, suggesting stable profitability.
* **Equity:** Shows a steady increase, indicating growth in shareholder equity.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE fluctuates but generally demonstrates profitability.  The substantial drop in Q4 2023, followed by an increase, warrants further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Data:**  The prompt lacks recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions within the last two days which is crucial for a comprehensive analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WMT has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period, exhibiting strong cumulative returns. However,  recent indicators (RSI) suggest the stock may be overbought, potentially leading to a short-term correction.  Long-term prospects appear positive based on the high expected return, but this is contingent upon the continued positive performance as indicated by the high CAGR of the last period.  Analyzing the provided financial data reveals overall strong profitability and stability, though some quarter-to-quarter variations require deeper investigation.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a full assessment of current market sentiment and future prospects. More data on analyst expectations and recent news would improve the analysis.

**8. Recommendations:**

A thorough analysis requires additional information, particularly recent news, analyst ratings, and a comparison of reported earnings to analyst expectations.  While the long-term outlook appears positive based on historical performance and expected return, the overbought RSI suggests caution in the short term.  Further due diligence is needed before making any investment decisions.
