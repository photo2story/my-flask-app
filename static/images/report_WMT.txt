## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores.

The cumulative return of WMT is 187.14%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 112.74%.  The difference is 74.4%, placing it in the 92.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This suggests strong relative performance.  However, this is a snapshot in time and past performance is not indicative of future results. The provided alpha values consistently near zero suggest the outperformance isn't due to factors unrelated to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $90.79
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $91.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $92.11
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $88.52

The current price is below all three moving averages, indicating a potential short-term downtrend.  However, this is a short-term observation and doesn't provide a long-term perspective.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.66 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.29 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1.0% (This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming consistent past performance.  This is a very low figure and should be interpreted cautiously.)

The conflicting signals from RSI, PPO, and relative divergence suggest uncertainty in the short-term direction.  The low expected return relative to the historical data suggests caution.  The current price is slightly below recent averages, indicating potential for a moderate rebound.  There's no evidence of a rapid surge or decline.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (two entries for 2024-12-06).  Assuming the duplicate entry is an error, we can observe:

* **Revenue:** Generally stable and growing, showing consistent quarterly revenues above $159 Billion.
* **EPS:** Fluctuates quarterly, with some decline in the latter half of 2023, followed by a small uptick.  Further analysis and reconciliation of the duplicate entry is needed for a clearer picture.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains consistently high, and profit margins are relatively stable, although there's a slight dip in Q1 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown steady growth, while ROE has fluctuated, with a significant drop in Q4 2023 before recovering.

The financial data suggests a generally healthy financial position, with steady revenue and relatively stable profitability.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WMT has historically outperformed the S&P 500.  However, recent technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bearish trend.  The low expected return (1%) warrants a cautious approach.  Despite a strong historical performance, the current data point towards a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook. Long-term prospects may depend on sustaining revenue growth and profitability, while mitigating market uncertainties. Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data and a more in-depth analysis of macroeconomic factors are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The historical outperformance against the S&P 500, despite near-zero alpha, needs more thorough examination.
