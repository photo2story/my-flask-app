    *   **RSI:** The RSI of 58.16 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.

    *   **Recent Divergence Change:**  The positive change in relative divergence over the past 20 days is a bullish signal.
    *   **Expected Return:** A 2.7% expected return (compared to the S&P 500) suggests modest outperformance potential for a long-term investment. The recent decline in price {'price': 114.36, 'previousClose': 114.83, 'change': -0.41} may simply be a short-term dip.
