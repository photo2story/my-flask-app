2025-01-30 - Analysis Report
## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores.

The cumulative return of WMT is 208.35%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 119.94%.  The difference is 88.4%, placing it at the 99.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates a strong outperformance relative to the market.

The provided alpha values are consistently near zero, suggesting the stock's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta is largely irrelevant given the strong outperformance). However, the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies significantly across different periods, indicating volatility in performance. The high CAGR in the recent periods (2022-2025) is noteworthy and explains the significant outperformance observed.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of this recent surge.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $97.5
* **5-day Moving Average:** $96.15
* **20-day Moving Average:** $92.64
* **60-day Moving Average:** $90.58

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates a recent strengthening of this trend, but more data would be needed for a definitive statement.  The increase of 0.21 compared to the previous close suggests a minor upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 79.32 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.63 – A positive value suggests a bullish trend.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +8.2 – Shows a recent increase in relative strength, supporting the upward price movement.
* **Expected Return:** 1.0% – This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment.  This seems low compared to the recent historical performance and should be examined more deeply.  The low expected return in spite of the excellent historical performance may suggest that the market has priced in much of the future success, or that the exceptional recent performance is not sustainable.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicate entries.  A more reliable and complete dataset is required for a meaningful analysis.  Clean data showing clear trends in EPS and revenue growth would be useful for valuation.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue has been relatively stable over the past five quarters, with slight fluctuations.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have remained consistently high (23.97% to 25.11%) throughout the provided period, indicating strong profitability.
* **Equity:** Equity has been steadily increasing, reflecting growth in the company's net worth.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE has fluctuated, with a notable dip in the quarter ending October 2023 before recovering substantially in the subsequent periods, suggesting improved efficiency in utilizing equity.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart (WMT) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past, particularly recently. However, technical indicators suggest that the stock may be overbought, and the expected return is relatively modest considering the past performance.  The provided earnings data needs clarification to ascertain its veracity and allow for meaningful analysis.  Revenue and profit margins are robust and highlight the company's financial strength.  The substantial recent outperformance against the market should be further investigated to determine if it is likely to be sustainable in the future. The low expected return despite this high historical performance suggests caution and warrants more rigorous investigation into the fundamentals before committing to a long-term investment.
