**1) Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  While generally positive alpha suggests outperformance relative to the market (beta), the significant fluctuations highlight the impact of market conditions on WMT's performance.  Note that high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values are observed, especially in recent years (2022-2025).  However, high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) in certain periods indicate significant risk.

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

* **Expected Return:** 1.7% (Long-term (2+ years) expected outperformance relative to S&P 500).  This modest expectation might be due to the already high historical outperformance.



**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent (duplicate entry for 2024-12-06).  Assuming the duplicate is an error, we observe some fluctuations in both EPS and revenue.  A more detailed analysis requires consistent and complete data.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-12-06 | 0.57 | $168.00 B     |
| 2024-08-30 | 0.56 | $167.77 B     |
| 2024-06-07 | 0.63 | $159.94 B     |
| 2023-11-30 | 0.17 | $159.44 B     |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue has been relatively stable, hovering around $160-170 billion for the past year. Profit margins are also consistently high (around 24-25%). Equity has been steadily increasing, while ROE (Return on Equity) shows some fluctuation, indicating varying levels of profitability based on the equity invested. The significant drop in ROE in 2023-10-31 warrants further investigation.


| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity  | ROE    |
|---------|------------|---------------|---------|--------|
| 2024-10-31 | $169.59B  | 24.91%       | $88.11B | 5.19%  |
| 2024-07-31 | $169.34B  | 25.11%       | $84.42B | 5.33%  |
| 2024-04-30 | $161.51B  | 24.81%       | $81.29B | 6.28%  |
| 2024-01-31 | $173.39B  | 23.97%       | $83.86B | 6.55%  |
| 2023-10-31 | $160.80B  | 24.64%       | $79.46B | 0.57%  |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

WMT has historically shown strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a significantly higher cumulative return. However, recent price action indicates a potential slowdown, supported by the position below moving averages and bearish PPO. While the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the current low price relative to the moving averages might indicate a need for caution.  Further investigation is needed into the inconsistencies in the earnings data and the sharp drop in ROE during 2023-10-31.  The positive alpha and high CAGR in recent years are encouraging, but the high MDDs highlight the inherent risk.  The long-term outlook, with a projected 1.7% outperformance over the S&P 500, suggests a relatively conservative long-term investment opportunity, especially considering the already strong historical outperformance.  Thorough due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.
