**0) Overview:** Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores.

**1) Cumulative Return Comparison:**

Walmart (WMT) shows a significantly higher cumulative return (186.27%) compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 72.42%.  The difference is a substantial 113.8 percentage points.  The relative divergence, considering historical fluctuations, places this current outperformance at the 99.6th percentile, indicating a remarkably strong performance compared to its historical relationship with the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different periods.  While beta generally hovers around 0.3-0.4, indicating moderate sensitivity to market movements, alpha shows periods of significant outperformance (e.g., 2017-2019, 2022-2024) and periods close to or below zero.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values in recent years suggest strong growth.  However, it's crucial to note that the high maximum drawdown (MDD) values in certain periods (e.g., 2016-2018) highlight significant downside risk. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) consistently increases over time reflecting growth.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $92.41
* **Previous Close:** $93.22
* **Change:** -$0.87 (a decrease of approximately 0.93%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $93.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $93.11

The price is slightly below both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent minor downward trend.  However, it sits above the 20-day moving average, which could indicate a potential short-term support level.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.56 (Neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum)
* **PPO:** 1.09 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 3.9% (Long-term S&P 500 outperformance)

The recent price drop of -$0.87 is relatively small and doesn't suggest a dramatic event (no significant 급반등 or 급하락). The combination of indicators suggests a relatively stable but potentially slightly bearish short-term outlook.  The positive PPO and the projected 3.9% long-term outperformance are bullish signals for long-term investors.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and consistent growth in revenue.  There's a notable drop in EPS in 2023-11-30, which should be investigated further to understand the underlying reasons.  Overall, revenue growth is strong and consistent across the reporting periods.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Walmart (WMT) demonstrates a strong long-term performance history, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. While short-term indicators suggest a slightly bearish trend, the long-term outlook appears positive, supported by consistent revenue growth, healthy profit margins, and a projected long-term outperformance relative to the market. However, the significant maximum drawdowns observed in the past highlight potential downside risk.  Further investigation into the reasons for the EPS drop in late 2023 and potential anomalies in the earnings data is recommended before drawing final conclusions.  The relatively high valuation compared to the S&P 500 should also be considered.  Investors should weigh the potential for long-term growth against the risks involved.
