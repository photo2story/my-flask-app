## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Walmart Inc. (WMT) is a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.  The cumulative return of WMT (201.11%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (130.05%) over the measured period. The difference is 71.1%, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance.  The provided alpha consistently shows a negative value, indicating underperformance relative to the market, which is in stark contrast to the cumulative return comparison, suggesting potential issues with the alpha calculation or a very non-linear performance profile.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**  The alpha values are consistently negative, suggesting that WMT has underperformed the market benchmark over various periods, despite the overall impressive cumulative return. This inconsistency needs further investigation. The beta generally stays around 0.1, indicating low market sensitivity. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates across the years, showing strong growth in some periods, but less so in others. MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is inconsistent, with several periods experiencing significant drawdowns. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows steady growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $92.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $91.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $86.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $82.38

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential uptrend. The relatively large gap between the closing price and the 20- and 60-day moving averages shows a recent surge in price.  The price is near its recent high.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 78.14 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction might be imminent.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.70 – A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN – The absence of data prevents an analysis of recent relative divergence.  The note of "short-term decline" is inconsistent with the provided pricing data.
* **Expected Return:** 10.5% – This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming the current upward trend continues.  The 92.59 closing price aligns with this positive outlook, implying a potential further upward move. This should not be taken as a strong signal and further investigation is needed to account for possible high overbought conditions.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant inconsistencies and lacks sufficient context for a comprehensive analysis. The EPS (Earnings Per Share) fluctuates dramatically between quarters, without clear trends, which necessitates further investigation to uncover potential causes. Similarly, revenue figures fluctuate.  A more detailed analysis requires information about analyst expectations to assess whether these results were beats or misses. The repeated "160.28 B$" entry on the same date raises serious concerns regarding the accuracy and completeness of the data.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates with a general upward trend (though not consistently). Profit margins remain relatively stable around 24-25%, indicating consistent profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows steady growth. ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, with some quarters showing significant variations. This inconsistency needs further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or market outlook information was provided to inform this analysis.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also absent.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

WMT demonstrates impressive long-term cumulative returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500. However, several inconsistencies exist:  negative alpha values contradict the high cumulative return;  the earnings data is unreliable; the technical indicators point towards an overbought condition that could trigger a short-term correction; and critical contextual information (news, analyst opinions) is missing.  Therefore, while the long-term performance is exceptionally positive, the short-term outlook necessitates caution due to the overbought RSI and inconsistent EPS and revenue data.  Further investigation into the data discrepancies and inclusion of missing news and analyst sentiment is crucial for a robust and reliable conclusion.  The current high price point should be considered a high-risk, high-reward investment given the lack of confidence in the data's robustness.
