**1) Return Rate Comparison (WMT vs. S&P 500)**

*   **WMT Overview:** Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores.
*   **WMT Cumulative Return:** 163.01%

The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, but this should be balanced against other indicators.  The RSI is approaching oversold territory, which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity, though it doesn't guarantee a reversal.  The PPO being negative confirms the recent downward momentum. The "Hybrid Signal" suggests caution despite the high MRI, recommending a partial buy.  The negative divergence change confirms the recent short-term decline.  The expected return is moderately positive.
