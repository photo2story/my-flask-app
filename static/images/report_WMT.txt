**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Walmart Inc. (WMT) is a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.  Over the period analyzed, WMT's cumulative return (174.27%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 123.86%. The difference is 50.41%, representing the 98.09th percentile of historical divergence between the two.  This suggests WMT has historically outperformed the market in a significant manner, although past performance doesn't guarantee future results.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent positive alpha across the analyzed periods (2015-2024), indicating WMT's outperformance relative to the market benchmark.

However, the substantial drop in alpha from 2020 to 2021 is noteworthy, and may be explained by further analysis of market conditions at the time.  The increase in beta for 2022-2024 suggests increased market correlation.
