**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows strong growth, particularly in the most recent periods (2022-2025). The negative growth during the 2018-2022 period appears to be an anomaly in the longer-term trend.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Generally high, indicating significant potential downside risk, although the most recent period (2023-2025) shows a decrease.
*   **Alpha:**  Consistently positive, indicating WMT's performance exceeding what would be expected based on market movements alone. Recent years show very strong Alpha.
*   **Beta:** Low and stable, indicating that WMT's price is not strongly correlated with the overall market.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** Shows a consistent increase in market capitalization, especially a large jump recently, reflecting investor confidence and/or company growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 114.36
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 112.6, Previous Close: 114.36, Change: -1.54
*   **5-day SMA:** 115.41
*   **20-day SMA:** 112.88
*   **60-day SMA:** 106.69

**Analysis:**

*   The recent price (112.6) is below the previous close (114.36), indicating a slight recent downturn.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA. This *could* suggest an uptrend *if* the 5-day and 20-day remain high. However, the 5-day SMA being higher than the closing price suggests a possible cooling-off period. The current price being below the 5-day SMA indicates a very short-term downward momentum.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 58.16
*   **PPO:** -0.19
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.9 (Short-term decline)
*   **Last market change (price):** -1.54 (Reflects fluctuation issue)
*   **Expected Return:** 3.0% (Long-term, exceeding S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Indicates a moderate level of risk and suggests a medium investment level is appropriate.
*   **RSI:** A reading of 58.16 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A slightly negative PPO suggests short-term downward momentum, although the value is close to zero and doesn't indicate a strong trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Recommends a relatively high investment level (80% of cash), but with caution, likely due to the moderate MRI.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence confirms the short-term negative momentum.
*   **Expected Return:** A 3.0% expected return (above the S&P 500) is positive, suggesting that WMT is expected to outperform the market in the long run.
*   **Fluctuation:** The recent price change reflects some recent volatility.
