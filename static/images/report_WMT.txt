## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

Walmart Inc. (WMT) is a multinational retail corporation.  The provided data shows strong cumulative returns significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO). Recent price action suggests a relatively strong upward trend, though indicators offer a mixed signal regarding momentum and risk.  Earnings show recent stability and slight growth.  However, crucial financial data is missing, hindering a comprehensive assessment.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

WMT's cumulative return of 196.87% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's 82.57% return.  The difference (114.3%) places it at the 97.8th percentile of the historical range of outperformance (ranging from -26.6% to 117.5%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently positive Alpha, indicating outperformance relative to the market benchmark in most periods. However, the Beta varies slightly across years, suggesting volatility relative to market swings.  High CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is notable, but high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) in some periods indicates significant potential for downside risk. Market cap has steadily increased across the observation period.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue           |
|------------|--------|--------------------|
| 2024-12-06 | $0.57  | $168.00 Billion   |
| 2024-08-30 | $0.56  | $167.77 Billion   |
| 2024-06-07 | $0.63  | $159.94 Billion   |
| 2023-11-30 | $0.17  | $159.44 Billion   |
| 2024-12-06 | $0.06  | $159.44 Billion   | *(Note: This line appears duplicated, possibly an error in the data)*

Revenue shows relative stability with slight growth. EPS fluctuates, requiring further investigation to determine the causes behind these variations.  The apparent duplication of the December 2024 data needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

No "Total Revenue" or "Gross Profit" data is available, significantly limiting a complete financial analysis. This missing information prevents a proper assessment of profitability and financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

WMT shows a strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Recent price action and technical indicators suggest a relatively positive outlook.  However, the missing financial data (revenue, gross profit) and fluctuating EPS prevent a complete evaluation. The high maximum drawdown in some periods from the Alpha/Beta analysis warrants caution. The 4.1% expected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is promising but depends heavily on the accuracy of the underlying assumptions and the availability of more comprehensive financial data.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data point and the missing financial information is crucial before making any investment decisions.
