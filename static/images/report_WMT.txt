## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Walmart Inc. (WMT) based on the provided data, encompassing performance, financial health, market sentiment, and future outlook.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 187.74% for WMT compared to 126.85% for the S&P 500 (VOO).  This results in a current return difference of 60.89%, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  While this indicates strong outperformance, the relative percentile should be considered in context of the historical volatility and the potential for future underperformance.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) presented in the table shows significant variability from year to year, highlighting the cyclical nature of the retail sector and WMT's response to various economic conditions.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $88.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $86.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $84.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $81.20

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 78.81 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.34 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.49 – This confirms a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 0.01% –  This indicates a low expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500, despite the past outperformance. The low figure suggests future gains may not significantly exceed the S&P 500.  The provided data does not offer sufficient detail to justify the low expected return.  Further analysis is needed.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows some variability. While the most recent quarter (2024-08-30) reported lower EPS than the previous quarter, the overall revenue remained strong and suggests continued, albeit fluctuating, growth.  Comparison to analyst estimates (not provided) is needed for complete analysis.  The large difference in EPS between 2023-09-01 and other recent quarters needs further investigation to understand underlying factors.


**5. Financial Health (from provided data):**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue is relatively stable over the past year, while profit margin shows slight fluctuation around 24-25%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally increased over the period, with ROE (Return on Equity) showing some variability, indicating influence of external factors.

A complete financial health assessment requires a more comprehensive analysis including debt levels, cash flow, and other key financial ratios.


**6. News and Recent Issues (requires external data):**

To provide an accurate analysis of recent news and market outlook, I need to access external sources like Shacknews, FINBOLD, and other financial news outlets to gather information on recent earnings announcements, analyst opinions, and other relevant market commentary within the past two days.  This information would provide a much more detailed and up-to-date assessment of the current market sentiment towards WMT.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart shows strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, current technical indicators suggest the stock might be overbought, warranting caution.  Financial statements indicate consistent revenue but fluctuating profitability.  The expected return of 0.01% relative to the S&P 500, however, casts doubt on significant future outperformance compared to the market benchmark.  A complete picture requires access to more current information and a deeper financial analysis.  Further analysis of news, analyst reports, and comparison to projected performance is essential before making any investment decisions.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the data, a long-term investment strategy with regular additions (dollar-cost averaging) could mitigate some of the risks associated with the potential for a price correction.  However, given the lack of specific information on current market sentiment and the low expected return relative to the S&P 500, a careful comparison to alternative investments is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Conducting further independent research and potentially seeking professional financial advice is crucial.
