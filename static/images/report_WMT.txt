2024-12-01 - Analysis Report
## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Walmart Inc. (WMT) is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores.

The cumulative return of WMT (201.11%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (130.05%) over the analyzed period.  The final divergence is 71.1%, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates WMT's substantial outperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently shows a negative value (-0.1), indicating underperformance relative to the market benchmark after accounting for beta.  However, this is contradicted by the vastly superior cumulative returns reported.  Further investigation is needed to reconcile this discrepancy, possibly examining the methodology used to calculate alpha and the specific timeframes compared.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $92.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $91.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $86.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $82.38

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-to-medium-term trend.  The significant gap between the closing price and the 60-day moving average underscores a recent price surge.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 78.14 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a pullback)
* **PPO:** 0.70 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** nan (-), indicating a recent short-term decline in relative strength.

The closing price of $92.52 reflects a recent price increase.  Given the RSI indicating overbought conditions, the sharp recent increase could be considered a period of rapid upward movement (a "spike").  A correction may be likely. The expected return of 10.5% over the long term (2+ years) represents a potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500. This is conditional upon the market outlook and company's performance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows inconsistencies. There are two entries for 2024-08-30 with different EPS and the same revenue.  This inconsistency needs clarification.  Analyzing only the consistent data, we can observe:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates but shows overall growth, excluding the duplicate entry.
* **EPS:** EPS is highly volatile, with significant swings between quarters.  A meaningful trend is difficult to establish due to the inconsistent data.
* **Beats/Misses:**  Without expectations data, it's impossible to determine if earnings beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, hovering around $160B-$170B. Profit margins are consistently strong, ranging from 23.97% to 25.11%, indicating healthy profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally increased, but ROE is volatile, fluctuating significantly between quarters (from 0.57% to 9.92%).  This high volatility warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to provide a complete analysis.  This data was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WMT has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  However, recent data points to potential short-term corrections due to overbought conditions (high RSI) and price volatility.  The inconsistent earnings data requires further clarification to draw solid conclusions regarding profitability trends. The high volatility in ROE also necessitates further investigation.  While long-term prospects look positive given the historical outperformance and generally strong financial metrics, short-term caution may be warranted due to technical indicators and inconsistencies in the provided data.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits the overall assessment.  A deeper dive into the data inconsistencies and inclusion of current market sentiment are crucial for a more comprehensive conclusion.
