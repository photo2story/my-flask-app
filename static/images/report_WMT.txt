* **Closing Price:** $91.72
* **Previous Close:** $94.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $94.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $98.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $95.66

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price drop (-$3.09 or -3.26%) is significant and should be further investigated.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.71 (Indicates oversold conditions, potentially suggesting a bounce).
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.96 (Shows a bearish signal).

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 2.3% (This represents the expected excess return compared to the S&P 500, assuming long-term investment and given current market conditions). The recent negative price change contributes to this relatively low expected return, but the long-term projection still signals potential outperformance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  While revenue generally remains high, EPS shows some fluctuations.  Further investigation is needed to determine the causes of these fluctuations.  Note there is duplicate data for 2024-12-06.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-12-06 | $0.57 | $168.00 B     |
| 2024-08-30 | $0.56 | $167.77 B     |
| 2024-06-07 | $0.63 | $159.94 B     |

| 2024-12-06 | $0.06 | $159.44 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, with slight quarterly fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high, indicating profitability. Equity is steadily increasing, and ROE (Return on Equity) exhibits some volatility, possibly reflecting seasonal effects or specific business decisions.  The significant drop in ROE in 2023-10-31 is noteworthy and warrants further investigation.


| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity   | ROE   |
|-------------|------------|---------------|----------|-------|
| 2024-10-31 | $169.59B   | 24.91%        | $88.11B  | 5.19% |
| 2024-07-31 | $169.34B   | 25.11%        | $84.42B  | 5.33% |
| 2024-04-30 | $161.51B   | 24.81%        | $81.29B  | 6.28% |
| 2024-01-31 | $173.39B   | 23.97%        | $83.86B  | 6.55% |
| 2023-10-31 | $160.80B   | 24.64%        | $79.46B  | 0.57% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

WMT has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, showing substantial cumulative returns. However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn.  While technical indicators point to oversold conditions, the negative PPO and recent relative divergence warrant caution.  The financial statements suggest consistent revenue and profitability, though some volatility in EPS and ROE requires further investigation to identify underlying causes.  A long-term investment strategy might still be favorable given the historical outperformance and projected long-term excess returns, but careful monitoring of the market and WMT's performance is crucial.  Further analysis including deeper dives into specific financial ratios and macroeconomic factors would enhance the robustness of this analysis.
