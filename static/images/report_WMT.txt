## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Walmart Inc. (WMT) is a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.  The cumulative return of WMT (191.45%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (118.39%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 73.1%, placing it at the 91.2th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided alpha values consistently hover around zero, suggesting the outperformance isn't significantly explained by factors beyond market movements (beta is also relatively low, suggesting less volatility than the market).  However, the CAGR fluctuates significantly year over year, highlighting periods of both strong and weak performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $91.66
* **5-day Moving Average:** $91.94
* **20-day Moving Average:** $93.53
* **60-day Moving Average:** $86.69

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 36.37 (Below 50, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.76 (Negative value, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -8.4% (Short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.9% (This represents an expected outperformance of 0.9% annually versus the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.  This figure requires careful consideration, as it's a very small margin and subject to significant fluctuation).

The current price ($91.66) isn't significantly above or below recent averages and doesn't immediately suggest a dramatic price shift (sudden jump or fall) based solely on this data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has remained relatively stable in the $160B-$170B range over the reported quarters, showing slight fluctuations but no strong upward or downward trend.
* **EPS:** EPS is volatile.  A significant drop is observed between Q2 2024 ($0.63) and Q4 2023 ($0.17). There is then a subsequent increase in Q1 2024. The most recent quarter's EPS ($0.57) is lower than the previous two.  A notable downward trend is not clearly visible from only these data points.

**Further analysis would require comparison to analyst expectations for a conclusive "beat" or "miss" assessment.**


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates but generally remains high. Profit margins are consistently strong, hovering around 24-25% with minor quarterly variations.
* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity has shown a steady increase over the past year.  ROE was considerably higher in Q1 and Q2 2024 before declining.  A significant drop in ROE is seen in Q4 2023, which then subsequently recovered, potentially indicating cyclical variation rather than a continuous trend.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**  This section requires information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions, which wasn't provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart shows strong long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500, demonstrated by the cumulative return. However, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, corroborated by RSI and PPO indicators signaling oversold conditions and bearish momentum, respectively. The most recent earnings show some volatility in EPS, while revenue remains relatively stable and profit margins are high. Financial data suggests a healthy balance sheet and significant equity growth.  A long-term investment may be considered, but the relatively low expected outperformance should be carefully weighed against the market volatility and the limitations of this analysis (e.g., the small number of data points).  Further analysis, particularly incorporating the missing information from Section 6, is critical to make a more informed investment decision.
