## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Walmart Inc. (WMT) is a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.  The cumulative return for WMT is 194.41%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 127.58%. The difference is 66.83%, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This suggests that WMT has historically outperformed the market significantly. The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data from 2015-2024 further supports this strong historical performance, although this varies significantly year-to-year.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $90.44 (Last Market: $90.18)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $87.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $84.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $81.43

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the 5-day average indicates less volatility in the recent past.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 81.83 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.54 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +3.44 – Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 0.01% - This suggests a very low expected return relative to the S&P 500.  The low value likely represents a short-term expectation and contrasts the potentially higher long-term return described elsewhere.

The provided 90.18 closing price is not explicitly stated to be significantly higher or lower than an established level. A sharp upward or downward movement would need more context to assess if a significant event triggered the price shift.  The small difference of $0.26 between last market and closing prices do not indicate a sudden major shift.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show volatility.  A comprehensive analysis requires access to analyst expectations and further details. The significant drop in EPS from 2.93 to 0.17 between September 2023 and November 2023 is noteworthy and requires further investigation.  Similarly, the August 2024 EPS figures (0.56 and 0.98) are divergent and need clarification.


**6. Financial Information:**

The provided financial data shows relatively stable revenue and profitability over the past year, albeit with some fluctuations.  Profit margins remain consistently in the mid-20% range. Return on equity (ROE) is variable, and a significant decrease is observed in Q4 2023. This data reinforces the need for deeper analysis of underlying factors impacting this variability.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Data:**  The prompt requests analysis of recent earnings news from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD.  This information is not provided and is necessary for a complete assessment.  This is also crucial for understanding Analyst Opinions and Performance Highlights.  
* **Market Outlook:**  Without access to current news and analyst opinions, a detailed market outlook is impossible.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart shows a strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, but recent indicators suggest a potential near-term correction due to overbought conditions (RSI).  The inconsistent and somewhat concerning EPS figures require further investigation, as does the variability in quarterly ROE. The absence of current news and analyst opinions prevents a complete assessment.  A thorough review of financial statements, and current market analysis from reputable sources is needed for a full investment decision.  The provided expected return of 0.01% may be limited to a short-term horizon, while long-term returns relative to the S&P 500 are historically positive.

**9.  English Report:**

This report summarizes the provided data on Walmart Inc. (WMT).  The company shows strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by a high cumulative return. However, recent technical indicators suggest the stock may be overbought, and volatile recent earnings data necessitate further investigation.  Missing information prevents a comprehensive market outlook and a more definitive investment recommendation.  A thorough analysis using current financial statements, news articles from reliable sources (e.g., Shacknews, FINBOLD), and analyst reports is recommended before any investment decisions are made.  The small provided expected return likely represents a short-term view and does not accurately reflect the potential for long-term outperformance based on historical data.
