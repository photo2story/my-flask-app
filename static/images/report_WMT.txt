## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Report

This report analyzes Walmart Inc. (WMT) stock performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and incorporating recent financial data, technical indicators, and news.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.  The cumulative return of WMT is 174.27%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 123.86%. The difference is 50.41%, placing it at the 98.09th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a strong relative outperformance.  The provided alpha values consistently remain positive, highlighting outperformance relative to the market benchmark (though note that past performance is not indicative of future results).  The beta values, consistently below 1, suggest lower volatility than the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $84.25 (Last market: $84.27)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $84.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $83.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $80.49

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downward trend. However, it is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a longer-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.89 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.05 – A positive PPO suggests a bullish momentum, although the value is relatively low, suggesting a less pronounced momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +7.92 – This indicates a short-term upward trend in relative strength.

Given that the closing price ($84.27) is only slightly higher than the provided last market price, there's no indication of a significant sudden jump (rapid surge) or drop (rapid decline).  The expected return of 0.01% is extremely low and likely reflects a short-term perspective. Over the long term (2+ years) with consistent investment, the outperformance relative to the S&P 500 observed historically could continue, but this is not guaranteed.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and relatively stable revenue.  There's no context for comparing these figures to expectations, which would be crucial for a complete analysis.  To assess recent performance accurately, comparison with analyst expectations for EPS and revenue for the periods reported is necessary.  Without this data, a concrete conclusion on recent performance cannot be made.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable across quarters, with profit margins fluctuating within a narrow range (23.97% - 25.11%). This shows consistent profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** ROE (Return on Equity) is highly variable, suggesting fluctuations in profitability relative to shareholder equity. Further investigation into the factors driving this variance is required.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  The prompt requests analysis of news from the past two days, especially earning news.  This information is absent from the provided data.  To provide a complete picture, news sources (like Shacknews, FINBOLD) should be consulted for recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart (WMT) shows a strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, evidenced by significantly higher cumulative returns and positive alpha. Recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction, but longer-term indicators point towards an upward trend.  Technical indicators are neutral to slightly bullish. Financial statements showcase consistent revenue and fluctuating, but generally positive, profitability.  However, a complete evaluation requires analysis of the latest news, analyst forecasts, and comparison of reported earnings to those expectations.  The considerable volatility in ROE merits investigation.  More data is necessary to give a comprehensive, well-supported recommendation.


**8. Recommendations:**

More information is needed to provide specific investment recommendations.  The information provided suggests potential for outperformance relative to the broader market but should be considered in the context of your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance.  A thorough review of recent news, analyst opinions, and a comparison of reported earnings against expectations is crucial before making an informed decision. Consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
