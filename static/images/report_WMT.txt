## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Investment Report

**1. Performance Analysis:**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.

The cumulative return of WMT (190.33%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (115.41%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 74.9%, placing it at the 92.8th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates strong relative performance.  The provided alpha consistently shows a near-zero correlation with the market, suggesting that most of WMT's returns are not due to market-wide movements, but rather company-specific factors. The beta values are consistently higher than 1, indicating higher volatility than the market as a whole, but this also implies higher potential returns.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $91.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $90.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $92.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $87.97

The current price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend, but above the 60-day average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (36.43):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.47):** A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (+2.4):** Shows a recent short-term increase in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (1.0%):**  A 1.0% expected return over the long term (2+ years) represents a modest outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This is a low figure that may warrant further investigation as to its source. The current price of $91.80 does not signal any drastic price movement (no sharp increase or decrease is indicated).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally remained relatively stable around $160-170 billion, but there's no clear upward trend consistently demonstrated.
* **EPS:** EPS shows significant variability, with a notable drop in the last two quarters of 2023-2024.  The increase between Q1 and Q2 2024 is followed by a decline in the subsequent quarter.

**Significant Changes:** The significant drop in EPS from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024 needs further investigation to understand the underlying causes.  More context is needed to evaluate whether these results "beat" or "missed" expectations.  The provided data alone is insufficient for this analysis.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue is relatively stable, fluctuating around $160-$170 billion.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margin shows minor fluctuations, generally remaining stable between 24% and 25%.
* **Equity:** Equity has been steadily increasing over the reported period.
* **ROE:** Return on Equity was high in the first half of 2024, but decreased considerably at the end of 2023.  This warrants further investigation to determine the cause of this decline.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent earnings news within the last two days or broader market outlook and analyst opinions are provided. This section requires additional information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart (WMT) demonstrates a strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, recent earnings reports reveal some volatility in EPS, and further analysis is required to interpret these results within their broader economic context.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition, but bearish momentum is indicated as well.  The long-term expected return is low.  Additional information on recent news, analyst opinions, and a clearer understanding of the causes behind fluctuations in revenue and EPS are crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.  The provided data alone is insufficient to definitively recommend an investment strategy.
