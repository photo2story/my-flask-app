## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Walmart Inc. (WMT) is a multinational retail corporation operating a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.  The cumulative return of WMT is 202.83%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 129.75%. The difference is 73.1 percentage points, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical relative divergence against the S&P 500.  This indicates that WMT's performance has been substantially stronger than the S&P 500 over the measured period.  The provided alpha consistently shows a negative value (-0.1), suggesting underperformance relative to the market benchmark adjusted for risk (beta). However, the high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values in some periods indicate strong periods of growth, despite the consistently negative alpha.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $93.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $92.37
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $82.91

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential uptrend. The difference between the closing price and the last market price (94.1 vs 93.51) is minimal and doesn't indicate any significant recent price fluctuations.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 82.18 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term correction)
* **PPO:** 0.64 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** NaN (Insufficient data)
* **Expected Return:** 10.7% (Long-term, 2+ years, relative to S&P 500)

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought, implying a potential pullback.  However, a positive PPO indicates continued bullish momentum. The expected return of 10.7% over the long term is a positive outlook, exceeding the benchmark S&P 500 performance.  The missing data for relative divergence change prevents a definitive conclusion on short-term trend. The small difference between the closing and last market price doesn't suggest a rapid price movement (neither a surge nor a crash).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant inconsistencies, with EPS figures varying wildly between quarters.  For example, EPS was $2.93 in Q1 2023, but substantially lower ($0.17, $0.56, $0.63) in subsequent quarters.  Revenue remains relatively stable around $160B.  There is no information provided to compare reported numbers against expectations. This inconsistency makes conclusive analysis impossible without more complete data.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates slightly, remaining consistently around $160-$170 billion. Profit margins are generally stable between 23.97% and 25.11%, indicating consistent profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows a slight upward trend, but ROE (Return on Equity) is highly volatile, ranging from 0.57% to 9.92%. This volatility suggests potential instability in the company's profitability.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart (WMT) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, indicated by a large cumulative return difference.  However, recent quarterly earnings data is inconsistent and lacks context (compared to expectations), making a definitive assessment difficult.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction (high RSI), despite positive momentum (PPO). The long-term outlook is positive (10.7% expected return), but the inconsistent earnings and volatile ROE raise concerns.  Additional information on recent news, analyst opinions and complete earnings data is crucial for a more thorough analysis.
