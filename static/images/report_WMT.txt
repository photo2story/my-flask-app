## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.

The cumulative return of WMT (191.35%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (128.31%) by 63.04%.  This places WMT's performance at the 96.22nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided data.  While this indicates strong relative performance, it's crucial to consider that past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows WMT consistently outperforming the market (positive alpha) with lower beta than many growth stocks (less volatile).  However, the beta has decreased over time, suggesting reduced market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $89.50
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $88.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $84.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $81.64

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (73.74):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.55):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-0.45):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength against the market. This, coupled with the high RSI, suggests a potential pullback.
* **Expected Return (0.01%):** This low expected return is puzzling. It is essential to clarify the source and calculation method for this figure, as it seems unusually low given the historical outperformance.  The statement "current point from a long-term (more than two years) investment" suggests this is an annualized return *in excess* of the S&P 500 return. If so, clarification is needed to confirm it considers the inherent risks associated with long-term stock holdings.

Given the closing price of $89.45 is slightly below the last market price provided ($89.5), there is no evidence of a significant sudden jump or fall.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show significant variability. There appears to be an error in the data;  the 2024-08-30 entry is listed twice with differing EPS.   A thorough review of the data source is needed to ensure its accuracy.  Crucially, comparing these results to analysts' expectations would provide a much more comprehensive assessment.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue remains relatively stable, with profit margins hovering around 24-25%.  The slight decrease in profitability in Q4 2023 warrants further investigation.
* **Capital and Profitability:** ROE shows volatility.  The substantial drop in Q4 2023 warrants a deeper analysis of the underlying reasons.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **News Sources:**  Please provide the specific news sources (Shacknews, Finbold, etc.) you want me to analyze.  Without these, I cannot assess recent market outlooks, analyst opinions, or performance highlights for Walmart.  Once the specific sources are provided I can provide a summary of their findings.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary of 1-6):**

Walmart has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent technical indicators suggest a potential short-term pullback.  While the long-term outlook appears positive based on historical performance and relatively consistent revenue, concerns arise from the volatility in EPS, ROE, and the unexplained low expected return figure.  A thorough analysis of recent news and analyst opinions, as well as a clarification on the inconsistent financial data and expected return, is crucial for a complete assessment.  The provided data has inconsistencies which require addressing from the original source.

**8.  Recommendations:**

To generate a more complete and accurate report, please provide:

* **Corrected financial data:**  Review and correct the inconsistencies in the EPS and revenue data for 2024-08-30.  Include comparisons to analyst estimates.
