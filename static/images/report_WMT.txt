## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.

The cumulative return for WMT (190.77%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (118.37%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 72.4%, placing it at the 90.6th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500's performance. This indicates WMT has substantially outperformed the market benchmark.  The provided Alpha values are consistently near zero, suggesting WMT's performance is largely explained by market movements (Beta is consistently high, indicating high market correlation).  The high Beta and consistently low Alpha suggest that while WMT's returns are strong, they are mostly due to market-wide movements rather than company-specific factors.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $91.94
* **5-day Moving Average:** $91.38
* **20-day Moving Average:** $91.6155
* **60-day Moving Average:** $89.0517

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term positive trend.  The 60-day moving average is significantly lower, hinting at a stronger upward trend over the longer term. The recent price increase from the previous close ($91.30 to $91.94) is a modest gain, not indicative of a significant jump or drop.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 45.94 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, although closer to oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.1658 – A negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.5% – Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1.1% – This indicates a modest expected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) through a buy-and-hold strategy.  This relatively low expected return, despite the historical outperformance, might reflect market expectations already pricing in a degree of future success.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  While revenue generally shows an upward trend, EPS fluctuates.  There's a noticeable drop in EPS from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024, followed by a slight recovery.  More data is needed to assess whether this represents a trend or an anomaly.  The apparent duplication of the 2024-12-06 data point needs clarification.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-12-06 | 0.57  | 168.00        |
| 2024-08-30 | 0.56  | 167.77        |
| 2024-06-07 | 0.63  | 159.94        |
| 2023-11-30 | 0.17  | 159.44        |
| 2024-12-06 | 0.06  | 159.44        | *(Duplicate Entry - Requires Clarification)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable quarter over quarter with minor fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high (above 23%), indicating strong profitability.  Equity has shown a steady increase, with a slight dip in Q1 2024.  ROE (Return on Equity) has also fluctuated, showcasing periods of significant increases and one low figure (0.57% in Q4 2023).  Further investigation into the causes of these fluctuations would be beneficial.

| Quarter     | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE  |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|------|
| 2024-10-31 | $169.59        | 24.91%        | $88.11       | 5.19% |
| 2024-07-31 | $169.34        | 25.11%        | $84.42       | 5.33% |
| 2024-04-30 | $161.51        | 24.81%        | $81.29       | 6.28% |
| 2024-01-31 | $173.39        | 23.97%        | $83.86       | 6.55% |
| 2023-10-31 | $160.80        | 24.64%        | $79.46       | 0.57% |


**7. Overall Summary:**

Walmart (WMT) exhibits strong historical performance significantly exceeding the S&P 500.  However, its Alpha near zero suggests this outperformance is highly correlated with broader market movements. Recent price action shows a short-term positive trend, but technical indicators present a mixed picture.  Earnings show some volatility, requiring deeper analysis.  The company demonstrates consistent profitability and revenue, yet ROE displays considerable fluctuation.  The 1.1% expected return suggests that while WMT historically outperformed, future outperformance is not guaranteed to a large extent and market expectations are already high.  Further investigation into the causes of EPS and ROE fluctuations, along with clarification on duplicated earnings data, is necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.  This should also include a comparison of WMT's performance with peers in the retail sector to determine the true strength of its position.
