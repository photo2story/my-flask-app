*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows a wide range of performance, from negative growth in 2018-2021 to very high growth in recent periods (2022-2025). The recent high growth is particularly noteworthy.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses during the periods.  This should be a concern for risk-averse investors.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the excess return compared to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500).  While some periods show negative alpha, the recent periods (2022-2025) display very strong positive alpha, contributing to WMT's recent outperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is generally low (close to 0), suggesting WMT's price is not very correlated to the S&P 500. In other words, it's relatively insensitive to overall market movements.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Cap has grown significantly over the years, especially in the most recent periods, reflecting the company's growth.
