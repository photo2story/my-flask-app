The data shows significant variation in CAGR and Alpha across the years, highlighting the volatility inherent in the stock's performance.  Beta generally hovers around 0.1-0.5, suggesting lower than average market volatility.  However, the substantial Alpha values in recent years imply outperformance relative to the market.  Note: Some values seem inconsistent (e.g., Alpha values seem extremely high compared to CAGR); further investigation into the data source is recommended.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $98.16
* **Previous Close:** $98.65
* **Change:** -$0.49 (-0.5%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $97.80
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $93.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $91.13

The price is slightly below its recent moving averages, indicating potential short-term downside pressure. However, the price is still significantly above the 60-day average, suggesting an overall upward trend.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.76 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.65 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +4.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1.0% (This is a projected *excess* return over the S&P 500;  the actual return could be higher, but the value is low and needs more detailed modeling)

The RSI is nearing overbought levels, suggesting a potential short-term correction. However, the positive PPO and relative divergence indicate continuing upward momentum.  The relatively low expected excess return over the S&P 500 warrants further investigation and detailed risk assessment.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-12-06 | $0.57 | $168.00B      |
| 2024-08-30 | $0.56 | $167.77B      |

| 2024-12-06 | $0.06 | $159.44B      |


There's a duplication in the data (2024-12-06 appears twice). Assuming the duplicate is an error, revenue has remained relatively stable, with EPS showing some fluctuation. More information is needed for a complete analysis, including comparisons to previous years and industry benchmarks.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |

| 2023-10-31 | $160.80B   | 24.64%        |

| 2023-10-31 | $79.46B  | 0.57%  |

Equity has been steadily increasing. ROE shows some fluctuation but is generally strong, demonstrating Walmart's effective use of capital.  The significant drop in ROE in 2023-10-31 needs further investigation.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Walmart shows strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, with high cumulative returns and positive alpha in recent years.  However, recent price action suggests potential short-term volatility. While the financial statements demonstrate consistent revenue and generally strong profitability, inconsistencies and limited data require further analysis. The relatively low projected excess return over the S&P 500 should be examined more thoroughly.  Investors should carefully consider the risk/reward profile before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into data anomalies (e.g., duplicate earnings data, high alpha relative to CAGR) and more comprehensive financial modeling are recommended.
