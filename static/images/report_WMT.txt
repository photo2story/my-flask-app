## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores.

The cumulative return of WMT (189.48%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (112.47%).  The difference is 77.0%, placing it at the 94.7th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500 based on the provided data's minimum and maximum divergence.  This suggests a strong outperformance relative to the market over the period considered.  The provided alpha values of -0.0 consistently across multiple years suggest that the outperformance might be attributed to factors other than market beta, potentially stemming from company-specific strengths or sector performance.

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term weakness, but above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 43.32 – This indicates the stock is slightly in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a short-term bounce.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.27 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.  However, this should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.7 – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend in relative performance.

* **Expected Return:** 1.0% – This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon assuming consistent performance.  The low value signals a possible moderate long-term outperformance, not a dramatic one.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in EPS, with a slight downward trend in the most recent quarters.  Revenue shows a generally upward trend, although there's some fluctuation quarter to quarter.  Note that there is duplicate data in the provided table (2024-12-06 appears twice). This needs clarification to conduct a thorough analysis.

| 2024-08-30 | 0.56   | 167.77        |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, although there is a dip in Q1 2024. Profit margins are consistently high, suggesting good operational efficiency. Equity shows steady growth, and ROE (Return on Equity) indicates profitability, although there's a significant drop in Q4 2023. This needs further investigation to determine the underlying cause.

| Quarter    | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| 2024-10-31 | $169.59       | 24.91%        | $88.11       | 5.19    |
| 2024-07-31 | $169.34       | 25.11%        | $84.42       | 5.33    |
| 2024-04-30 | $161.51       | 24.81%        | $81.29       | 6.28    |
| 2024-01-31 | $173.39       | 23.97%        | $83.86       | 6.55    |
| 2023-10-31 | $160.80       | 24.64%        | $79.46       | 0.57    |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WMT shows strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500,  as evidenced by the high cumulative return. While recent price action indicates some short-term weakness,  longer-term indicators and the company's strong financial performance (high and relatively stable profit margins) suggest resilience.  However, the recent dip in ROE and the volatile EPS require further investigation to assess potential risks. The expected return, while positive, is modest.  A deeper dive into the duplicate earnings data and the reasons for the Q4 2023 ROE drop is needed before formulating a definitive investment strategy.  The provided data suggests a potentially sound long-term investment, but due diligence is essential.
