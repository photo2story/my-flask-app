Walmart's current price is $94.97.  The stock price has recently declined ($94.97 vs $97.59 previous close), falling below its 5-day ($96.83), 20-day ($100.03), and slightly above its 60-day ($95.70) moving averages. This suggests a short-term bearish trend.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (35.55):** Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound.
* **PPO (-0.84):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (-2.1):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (1.8%):**  A modest expected return over the S&P 500 is predicted for long-term (2+ years) investment.  The significant recent price drop (-2.68) could suggest a buying opportunity if the market rebounds as expected.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings data shows relatively stable revenue, with some fluctuations in EPS.  A slight decrease in EPS in the most recent period should be monitored to assess trends.  Further analysis of cost structures and market dynamics would provide a deeper understanding.

**5) Financial Information:**

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Walmart demonstrates a strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent price movements indicate a short-term bearish trend. While the RSI suggests potential for a rebound,  the PPO and relative divergence point towards bearish momentum.  The relatively stable revenue and profit margins, along with a projected modest long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500, suggest that Walmart remains a potentially attractive long-term investment. However, further analysis is needed to fully understand the recent EPS fluctuations and the significant drop in ROE in Q4 2023.  Careful monitoring of upcoming earnings reports and economic conditions is recommended.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data requires clarification.
