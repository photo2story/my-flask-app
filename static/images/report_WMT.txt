The difference is 69.7%, placing it at the 88th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500.  This indicates strong historical outperformance relative to the broader market. The provided alpha values consistently show near zero, suggesting that its returns are largely explained by market movements (beta).

The stock is currently trading below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it's above its 60-day moving average, implying a longer-term upward trend. The difference between the last market price and closing price may indicate a recent price fluctuation.  More data would be needed to determine if this is a significant event.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 18.7% – This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment, assuming current trends persist.  This is a forward-looking statement and is subject to significant market risks and cannot be guaranteed.

The last market price of $92.68 is higher than the closing price, indicating a recent uptick, but this is not enough to signify a significant rebound or decline without further context.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-12-06). Focusing on the unique entries, we observe:

* **Revenue:** Revenue generally shows growth, with some slight quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.  However, a consistent upward trend is not clearly established from this limited data set.
* **EPS:** EPS shows volatility. While there's a general upward trend, there are periods of significant drops (e.g., from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024).  Further analysis would be required to assess the reasons behind these fluctuations.  The provided data is insufficient to determine if these figures beat or missed expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable, while profit margins show slight fluctuations, generally within a narrow range.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is increasing, and ROE (Return on Equity) displays some volatility, dropping significantly in Q4 2023 before recovering.  This requires further investigation into the underlying drivers.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart (WMT) shows a history of strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500.
