* **Closing Price:** $86.6
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $84.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $83.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $80.81

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (76.66):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (0.1):**  A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (6.44, positive):** Shows a recent increase in the stock's relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.01%):**  This low expected return suggests a modest potential for long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500, despite the historical strength noted previously.  The 0.01% value is likely the *additional* return over the S&P 500, not the total return.  A more precise long-term expected return requires a more robust model.
* **Price at $86.6:**  While above moving averages, this price point does not suggest any immediate extreme price action (like a sharp spike up or down) given the overall trend.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show some volatility. While recent revenue numbers are strong, EPS exhibits inconsistency.  The August 30th, 2024 EPS figure (0.56) is substantially lower than the June 7th, 2024 (0.63) figure, even with increased revenue. Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying cause. Comparing this data to analyst expectations would provide crucial context.


**5. Financial Data Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, but profit margins show some minor fluctuations, possibly reflecting changes in operational costs or pricing strategies.
* **Capital and Profitability:** ROE fluctuates significantly, indicating variability in profitability.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of these changes.


**6. News and Recent Issues:** (Requires real-time data from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD.  This section cannot be completed without access to current news and analyst reports.)  This section would include details on any recent earnings announcements, analyst upgrades or downgrades, and any significant market events affecting WMT.


**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Walmart has historically outperformed the S&P 500. However, the recent financial results show some inconsistencies in EPS, despite stable revenue. Technical indicators suggest the stock is currently overbought, hinting at a potential pullback.  While the long-term outlook might remain positive given historical performance and its position as a dominant player in the retail sector, short-term volatility is likely.  A complete analysis necessitates examining recent news, analyst ratings and expectations, and a deeper dive into the company's financial statements.  The low projected excess return over the S&P 500 suggests that despite past outperformance, future gains compared to the market may be more modest.


**8. Overall Conclusion:**

Walmart (WMT) shows a strong historical track record of outperforming the market. However, current technical indicators suggest caution, and recent financial data require closer examination to understand the underlying drivers of earnings volatility.  A comprehensive due diligence including news analysis, analyst sentiment, and a detailed review of financial statements is highly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The long-term outlook remains dependent on factors such as future consumer spending, economic conditions and the companyâ€™s ability to maintain its market share.
