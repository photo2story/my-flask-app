**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicates.  The data needs to be cleaned and clarified before meaningful analysis can be performed.  There appears to be an issue with duplicate entries for December 6th, 2024.  Without corrected and consistent data, conclusions about trends in EPS and revenue cannot be reliably drawn.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, hovering around $160B-$170B. Profit margins are consistently strong, ranging from 23.97% to 25.11%, showcasing healthy profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally increased over time, although there's a slight dip in Q4 2023. Return on Equity (ROE) is quite variable; this volatility needs further investigation to understand the underlying drivers.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Walmart (WMT) has demonstrated strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the period covered by the data.  Technical indicators suggest a short-term positive trend. However, the provided earnings data requires correction to allow for accurate analysis.  The relatively high and stable profit margins are positive indicators of financial health. The inconsistent ROE data warrants further investigation.  More complete and reliable financial data, along with a clearer explanation of the methodology behind the 1.1% expected return, is needed for a more comprehensive assessment.  The current data suggests a strong historical performance but requires further analysis to predict future performance with confidence.
