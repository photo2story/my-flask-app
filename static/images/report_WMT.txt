## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Walmart Inc. (WMT) is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.

The cumulative return for WMT is 188.72%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference is 72.3 percentage points.  Considering the provided historical range of divergence (max: 82.9, min: -28.5), this places WMT's current outperformance at the 90.5th percentile relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

The provided alpha values are consistently near zero, suggesting WMT's returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta is consistently high, indicating high market sensitivity).  However, the high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures, particularly in recent years (2022-2024 and 2023-2025), illustrate strong performance despite the market's overall fluctuations.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $91.29
* **5-day Moving Average:** $91.59
* **20-day Moving Average:** $91.79
* **60-day Moving Average:** $88.86

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a slight downward trend in the short-term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 43.02.  This indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.24.  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -2.3.  This indicates a recent short-term price decline relative to the longer-term trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1.1%. This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment, assuming consistent performance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in EPS (Earnings Per Share) but generally upward trending revenue.  There's inconsistency in the data provided (duplicate entries for 2024-12-06).  A more reliable dataset is needed for comprehensive analysis.  Noteworthy is the significant jump in revenue from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024, followed by a slight decline in Q3 and Q4 2024, even if EPS remained relatively stable.

**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profit Margin show slight fluctuations throughout the year.  Notably, Q1 2024 has the highest revenue but a lower profit margin than Q2 and Q3 of the same year.  Equity and ROE (Return on Equity) show increases throughout most of the year, though the ROE experienced a dip in the final quarter of 2023 before returning to healthier levels.  Overall, the financials point to generally healthy performance.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

WMT has demonstrated strong long-term performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term slowdown.  The provided earnings data shows revenue growth, but volatility in EPS and margin indicates that the stock is not immune to the overall macroeconomic situation.  The expected long-term excess return is modest.  The slight downward price trend and bearish momentum indicators require caution.  Further analysis, including a more complete and consistent dataset regarding earnings, is required to make a more definitive judgment.  Considering the long-term growth potential, however, it is still worthy of consideration for long-term investors.
