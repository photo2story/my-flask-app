## Walmart Inc. (WMT) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, grocery stores, and discount department stores.

The cumulative return of WMT (211.99%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (121.08%).  The difference is 90.9%, placing it at the 100th percentile of the historical divergence range (max: 90.9, min: -28.5).  While this indicates strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. The provided alpha consistently shows near zero, suggesting that the outperformance is not significantly due to manager skill but rather may be attributed to sector or other market factors.  The beta values vary across the periods, illustrating fluctuations in the stock's sensitivity to overall market movements.

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The recent price change ($1.18 increase) indicates a positive short-term momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 1.0% (This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term investment.  This value needs further context and justification to be reliable. A more detailed analysis of the underlying model and assumptions is required for this to be meaningful.)

The high RSI and the recent sharp price increase warrant caution.  While the PPO and relative strength suggest positive momentum, the high RSI suggests potential overbought conditions, raising concerns about a potential short-term correction.
