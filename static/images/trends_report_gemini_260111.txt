How to read this report (30-second guide):

This is NOT a price prediction report. It shows relative position changes vs S&P500.
Focus: "Is the market favoring this stock more?" not "Will it go up/down?"

Core metrics (3 only):
- Rank: smaller number = better market position. Example: 51 -> 40 = relatively stronger.
- DER: internal model score. Absolute value meaningless. Change matters: large ↑ = model view improving rapidly, large ↓ = model view deteriorating rapidly.
- RD: model consensus 0-100. 100 = models agree strongly, 0 = models disagree completely.

Section guide:
[1] Summary: Most important changes today/week. Read this if time is limited.
[2] Rank Movers: Market "ranking" changes. Up = relatively stronger, down = relatively weaker.
[3] DER Changes: Model future view improving/deteriorating. Fastest "view change" signal.
[4] RD Changes: Confidence in signal. RD ↑ = direction confirmed, RD ↓ = uncertainty rising.
[5] Top10 Status: Top market group changes. No change = leadership stable (top holds despite lower-rank volatility).

One-line summary: This report shows "who is the market starting to favor" not "what to buy".
