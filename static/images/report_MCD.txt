While the stock has a strong underlying business, the overbought conditions and recent underperformance relative to the market warrant caution. A wait-and-see approach is recommended until the stock shows signs of consolidation or a potential breakout. Further research and analysis of the company's future growth plans and market conditions are essential for informed decision-making.
