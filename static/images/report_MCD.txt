McDonald's Corp (MCD) is a global fast-food corporation, operating and franchising restaurants worldwide.  Over the period analyzed, MCD's cumulative return (108.21%) lagged behind the S&P 500's cumulative return (123.86%).

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $297.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $297.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $297.92

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 44.52 - This suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.08 - A negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -18.2% -  Shows a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% - This suggests that, given the current data, the analyst expects no significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) from the current point.  This projection needs context and may change given different market conditions or new data.

**4. Recent Financials & Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows relatively stable revenue and fluctuating EPS. While revenue has generally increased, the profit margins have shown some minor fluctuations.  Note that the data for 2024-11-07 is duplicated.  To provide a complete analysis, we would need the earnings estimates alongside the actual results to assess performance against expectations.  Further analysis of quarterly reports is needed for a robust assessment of the long-term financial health.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has been relatively consistent, while profit margins fluctuate slightly between 55% and 58%. This suggests healthy profitability, though consistency could be improved.

**Capital and Profitability:**  Negative equity is concerning and requires further investigation into the company's balance sheet and financing strategies.  The negative ROE (Return on Equity) indicates that the company is not generating sufficient returns on shareholder investments.  This should be investigated further, and further financial statements and analysis are needed for a conclusive assessment.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  The prompt requests analysis of news within the last two days, including earnings announcements and analyst opinions from sources like Finbold. This information was not provided.  Without this, a complete picture of recent market sentiment and news impact is impossible.  The prompt should include the relevant news articles for a thorough analysis.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

MCD shows mixed signals. While it has a history of profitability and consistent revenue, its recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, with negative alpha in some periods.  Technical indicators suggest a slightly bearish short-term outlook, and the negative equity and ROE from the financial data raise serious concerns that require investigation into potential underlying issues and risks.  The missing news and analyst opinions prevent a complete evaluation of current market sentiment and recent developments.  Additional data is crucial for a more confident and comprehensive investment recommendation.

**9.  Complete and updated information (news, earnings calls, etc.) is needed for a more comprehensive analysis and a definitive recommendation.**
