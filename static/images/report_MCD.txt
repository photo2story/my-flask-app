**7. News & Recent Issues:**

* **Lack of Data:**  The provided information does not include recent news articles or analyst opinions from sources like Shacknews or Finbold.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

McDonald's presents a mixed picture. While it shows consistent revenue and generally stable profit margins, the negative equity and ROE figures are major red flags requiring thorough investigation.  The recent price action indicates a potential downward trend, supported by negative PPO and recent relative divergence. The low stated expected return (0%) and the absence of a clear upward trend suggest caution.  Further due diligence, including analysis of news, analyst ratings, and the reasons for negative equity, is needed before investment decisions.
