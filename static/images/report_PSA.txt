*   **Analysis:**

    *   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation.
    *   The RSI of 24.03 indicates that the stock is oversold, which could signal a potential buying opportunity, although oversold conditions can persist for extended periods.
    *   The PPO being negative suggest downtrend of the stock.
    *   The hybrid signal suggests buying 100% of cash on hand, and monthly invest 0.8% of total investment.
    *   The positive change in relative divergence (2.1) suggest short-term upward momentum, though it needs to be interpreted cautiously in light of the overall negative performance.
    *   The extremely negative expected return (-2013.7%) is highly unusual and suggests a severe potential for underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon. This figure is likely an anomaly or calculation error that should be investigated further.
