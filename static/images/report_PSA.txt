## Public Storage (PSA) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Public Storage (PSA) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in the ownership and operation of self-storage facilities.

As of the last data point, PSA's cumulative return is 51.45%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 122.16%.  The difference is -70.7%, placing it at the 1st percentile (1.0) of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates PSA has underperformed the market considerably over the period analyzed.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant volatility in PSA's performance, ranging from -24% to 84% across different periods.  While the later years show some improvement, the recent performance (-26% and -5% in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025, respectively) is concerning.  The consistently low or negative alpha suggests that PSA has not significantly outperformed the market after accounting for its beta (market risk).  The beta fluctuates, but generally shows higher than average market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $292.19
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $293.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $295.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $316.60

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average suggests recent price stability, though it is still below longer-term averages.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 44.46 –  Suggests the stock is currently in slightly oversold territory, but not significantly so.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.33 – Indicates a slight bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -3.1 – Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative strength against the market.
* **Expected Return:** -1371.7% – This extremely negative figure indicates a significant underperformance expectation relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) horizon based on this data point.  This should be treated with extreme caution. The methodology for calculating this figure is not provided and needs further clarification.  The high negative number likely suggests a significant discrepancy in the data or methodology used.

The small positive change in the last day's closing price (+$0.21) is not significant enough to indicate a dramatic shift in the trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a general downward trend in both EPS and revenue since the end of 2023.  There is also a duplicate entry for 2024-10-30.  This inconsistency requires clarification.  A more thorough review of historical quarterly data is needed to assess the long-term profitability trends.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 2.17   | $1.19B      |
| 2024-07-30 | 2.67   | $1.17B      |
| 2024-04-30 | 2.61   | $1.16B      |
| 2023-10-30 | 3.21   | $1.14B      |
| **2024-10-30** | **3.21** | **$1.14B** | *Duplicate Entry*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information reveals relatively stable revenue but some fluctuation in profitability metrics. Profit margins are consistently high, generally above 70%. ROE shows variability, indicating fluctuations in the company's efficiency in generating returns from shareholder equity.  More historical data is needed for a comprehensive analysis of financial health.


| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity  | ROE     |
|------------|----------|---------------|---------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.19B  | 72.92%        | $9.61B | 4.48%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.17B  | 74.34%        | $9.71B | 5.34%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.16B  | 71.96%        | $9.95B | 5.12%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $1.16B  | 74.93%        | $10.01B| 4.39%  |
| 2023-09-30 | $1.14B  | 74.74%        | $10.11B| 6.07%  |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PSA's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the period reviewed.  Recent price action suggests a downtrend, supported by technical indicators. While profit margins remain high, recent earnings data indicates a decline in both EPS and revenue. The extremely negative expected return figure needs further investigation and clarification regarding its calculation methodology.  Before investing, a comprehensive review of the company's long-term financial performance, competitive landscape, and the validity of the expected return calculation is necessary.  The data provided paints a concerning picture of PSA's relative performance and warrants further due diligence.

**8. Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the limited data provided. It is not financial advice, and any investment decisions should be made after thorough research and consultation with a qualified financial advisor.  The unusual and seemingly erroneous -1371.7% expected return requires further clarification.
