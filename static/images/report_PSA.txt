*   **Expected Return:** -936.7% (Very negative - significantly underperforming S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon).

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI & Hybrid Signal:** The low MRI suggests relatively low market risk. However, the hybrid signal recommends a cautious approach.
*   **Divergence:** The short-term improvement in relative performance suggests some recent positive momentum, but the overall picture is still weak based on the cumulative returns and long-term expected return.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major concern. This suggests the model predicts significant long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This is something that needs to be investigated further (potential data error, unique market conditions, etc.).
*   **Price drop Issue:** The price change of -1.34 reflects a minor downward trend, not a severe drop. It does not indicate a major market shock, but it is worth monitoring in conjunction with other indicators.
