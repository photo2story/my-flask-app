**6. Overall Analysis:**

PSA's performance has lagged the S&P 500 considerably,  despite relatively stable revenue and high profit margins.  Recent earnings show a concerning decline in EPS. Technical indicators suggest an oversold market, but the negative PPO and declining EPS warrant caution. The extremely negative long-term expected return (-74.8%) needs further clarification regarding the underlying assumptions and methodology. Before investing, further due diligence is necessary, including a thorough examination of the -74.8% expected return calculation, clarification of the duplicate earnings data entry, and an assessment of macroeconomic factors impacting the self-storage industry.  The high beta suggests increased risk compared to the overall market.
