**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing data is a significant limitation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PSA's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the observed period.  While some years showed positive alpha, the overall trend shows significant volatility and periods of substantial underperformance. Recent earnings indicate a decline in profitability. The extremely negative expected return (-415.3%) requires further investigation.  The lack of key financial data further hinders a complete assessment.  Before making any investment decision, more comprehensive financial data, and a thorough understanding of the -415.3% expected return calculation are crucial. The current technical indicators are mixed, not providing a clear buy or sell signal.
