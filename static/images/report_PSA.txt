*   **5-day SMA:** 275.556
*   **20-day SMA:** 273.3715
*   **60-day SMA:** 285.7097

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 60-day SMA but above its 5-day and 20-day SMAs. This could indicate a short-term upward trend but potential resistance at the 60-day SMA. The recent "last-market" data indicates a decrease in price, suggesting a potential fluctuation issue (decline).

**3) RSI, PPO and other Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 55.46 (Neutral – neither overbought nor oversold)

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.7 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -4624.2 (Extremely negative, indicating significant expected underperformance compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**  While the RSI is neutral and the PPO is slightly positive, the MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation (though the Hybrid Signal is more bullish and indicates a Buy with 0% cash). The negative change in relative divergence and the extremely negative expected return are concerning, suggesting potential continued underperformance. The large change in price from the last market (price': 272.06, 'previousClose': 276.63, 'change': -1.65) does indicate some recent volatility.
