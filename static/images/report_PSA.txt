**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** PSA
*   **Company Overview:** Public Storage is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates self-storage facilities.
*   **PSA Cumulative Return:** -6.087%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 102.213%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: -108.3
    *   Relative Divergence: 0.9
    *   Max: 22.6
    *   Min: -109.5

**Analysis:**

Public Storage has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. The divergence shows a massive difference in cumulative returns. The 'Relative Divergence' of 0.9 indicates that the current divergence is near the *lowest* point of its historical range of divergence, meaning the underperformance is near its worst relative to VOO within the observed period.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|----------|------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | -5.0% | 81.3% | -110.0% | -0.1 | 45.8   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** -5.0% indicating a negative average annual return over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 81.3% which is a very large drawdown, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:** -110.0% suggests significant underperformance relative to its benchmark (likely the S&P 500).  It means the stock performed 110% worse than what the beta would predict, meaning even after adjusting for market movements, PSA underperformed.
*   **Beta:** -0.1 indicates a very weak or negative correlation with the market.  A negative beta means that PSA tends to move *opposite* to the market. This is unusual for most stocks.
*   **Cap(B) Market Cap (Billions):** 45.8. Market Cap has shrunk a bit from the recent data.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 261.13
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 260.75, Previous Close: 261.13, Change: -0.15
*   **5-day SMA:** 260.524
*   **20-day SMA:** 267.244
*   **60-day SMA:** 279.9848

**Analysis:**

The stock price is trending downwards. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This indicates a short-term and medium-term downtrend. The small change in the "Last Market Data" suggests a bit of price stability right now after the big drop.

**3) RSI, PPO Index Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 39.44
*   **PPO:** -0.0963
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-16)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.8 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -4771.7

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, indicating a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 39.44 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* signal a potential for a price rebound.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The signal is suggesting to buy but with caution.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a *short-term* uptick in performance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is highly concerning. This number should be verified and examined carefully as it's very unusual.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **[2025-11-21] Public Storage (PSA): Evaluating Potential Value After Recent Share Price Decline:** This headline confirms concerns about the stock's performance and suggests investors are assessing whether it's undervalued.

**Analysis:**

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~2.00 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Opinions:** 20
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 319.10 / 350.00 / 290.00

**Analysis:**

Despite the recent poor performance, analysts generally have a "Buy" rating on the stock and the Target Price is well above the current stock price.

However, the lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess if recent events are influencing analyst sentiment.
