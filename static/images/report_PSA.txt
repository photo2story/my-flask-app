**Public Storage (PSA) Investment Report**

The cumulative return of PSA (51.45%) slightly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (52.12%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -0.7%, placing it at the 14.4th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-16.0% to 90.6%).  This suggests PSA's performance is relatively close to the benchmark but slightly below.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows mixed results regarding Alpha and Beta:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | 50.0% | 10.5% | 1.0   | 45.2  |
| 2021-2023  | 40.0% | 10.5% | 1.0   | 51.4  |
| 2022-2024  | -26.0% | 12.7% | -50.0% | 52.5  |
| 2023-2025  | -5.0% | 12.7% | -48.0% | 51.2  |

While Alpha is consistently around 1.0, suggesting similar performance to the market, the Beta fluctuates significantly (45.2 to 52.5), indicating varying levels of volatility relative to the market. Negative CAGR in the 2022-2024 period highlights significant market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $292.19
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $293.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $295.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $316.60

The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent slight increase of $0.2057 from the previous close is not significant enough to suggest a strong reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.46 – This indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory (below 50), but not yet definitively so.
* **PPO:** 0.33 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum, though relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.4% – Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 217.3% – This represents a significant outperformance expectation relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This projection needs careful consideration and may be subject to significant variance.

The small price increase is not significant enough to signal a dramatic change in the current trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a mixed picture:

| Date        | EPS     | Revenue      |

EPS has shown a downward trend in recent quarters. Revenue remains relatively stable.  The duplicate entry for October 2024 needs clarification.

Equity has slightly decreased, while ROE fluctuates, indicating some variability in profitability relative to shareholder equity.


**7.  Overall Analysis:**

PSA shows a mixed performance picture. While its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 has been somewhat stable, recent quarters show a decline in earnings per share.  High and consistent profit margins are positive indicators. However, the current price is below its moving averages, and technical indicators suggest a potentially weakening short-term trend. The projected long-term return is significant but requires careful consideration due to its inherent uncertainty.  Further investigation into the reasons for the decline in EPS and clarification on the duplicate data entry are necessary before making any investment decisions. The relatively high Beta underscores the market sensitivity of this investment.


**8. Conclusion:**

Further due diligence, including a deeper examination of the macroeconomic environment impacting the self-storage industry and a review of the company’s future outlook and growth strategy, is crucial before making an investment decision.  The high projected long-term return should be viewed cautiously, as it's a forward-looking estimate.  Given the current data and trends, a conservative approach is recommended.
