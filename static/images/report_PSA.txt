The alpha and beta analysis below provide further context.

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values.  While recent years show positive alpha (outperforming the market), earlier years exhibit negative alpha indicating underperformance relative to the market. The beta consistently hovers around 27-30, indicating higher volatility than the overall market (beta of 1).  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) increased significantly over the analyzed period.

* **60-day Moving Average:** $295.58

The price is slightly above the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent price increase.  However, it's close to its moving averages, possibly indicating consolidation or indecision in the short term. The recent price change of $2.41 (from $289.03) shows a minor positive movement.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.2% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -29.4% (Significantly lower than S&P 500; This is a concerning figure and needs further investigation into the reasons behind this negative expected return)

The recent price increase of $2.41 is not significant enough to be termed a "sharp upward movement".

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a recent decline in EPS and revenue. There's a duplicated entry for 2024-10-30 which needs clarification.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind this recent trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PSA's recent performance lags behind the S&P 500, although the relative divergence suggests this underperformance is not unprecedented. The consistently high profit margins are positive, but the declining EPS and revenue, combined with a negative long-term expected return (-29.4%), raise significant concerns. Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying reasons for this negative expectation and recent earnings trends.  A deeper dive into the company's strategy, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors affecting the self-storage industry is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The fluctuating alpha and beta values highlight the volatility of the stock and the importance of considering the risk tolerance before investing.
