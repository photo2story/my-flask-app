*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows volatile growth, with periods of significant losses. Recent years (2022-2025) exhibit negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD across all periods suggests significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha in many periods indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark, especially pronounced in the later years.
*   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuate but are generally low. It means that PSA's price is less sensitive to market movements and can offer stability during market downturns.
*   **Capitalization:** Capitalization has generally increased over time, though it has stabilized recently.

**2. Recent Stock Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** $286.29
*   **Previous Close:** $280.26
*   **Change:** 2.15% (Significantly positive change, suggesting a recent rebound)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** $281.85
*   **20-day Moving Average:** $287.77
*   **60-day Moving Average:** $286.65

**Analysis:** The price is currently above the 5-day moving average but below the 20 and 60 day moving averages. This suggests short-term upward momentum but potential resistance at those higher levels. The positive change relative to the previous close indicates a potentially significant market event or reaction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - This is contradictory, suggesting the system sees the stock as a good investment despite other negative indicators.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 39.34 (Below 50, indicating potential for further downward movement, not yet oversold.)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.24 (Negative, indicating a bearish trend, but close to zero, suggesting potential stabilization.)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-02)" - Again, a very bullish signal despite other concerns.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Disparity Change:** -1.5 (Negative, indicating a short-term decline relative to the benchmark)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -390.4% (Extremely negative, suggesting significant long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if investing from the current point.)

**Analysis:**  There's a significant disconnect between the MRI and Hybrid signal (bullish) and the expected return, alpha, and disparity metrics (bearish). The recent price increase and MRI may be influenced by short-term factors not captured in the longer-term performance data.
