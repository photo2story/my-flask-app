**Analysis:**

*   **Underperformance:** PSA has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, particularly in more recent periods.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is generally negative, meaning the stock has not generated excess returns compared to what would be expected based on the market's performance.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally low. A beta near 0 indicates little systematic risk. The recent Beta indicates that the stock price is moving more than the benchmark.
*   **MDD**: The maximum drawdown is significantly large.

*   **20-day Moving Average:** 296.68
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 296.12

**Analysis:**

*   The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average.
*   The price is above the 20 and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend, but the 5-day MA being higher than the current price might indicate a possible short term pullback.
*   The positive change compared to the previous close suggests some positive momentum.

**3. Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.35 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 61.77 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.32
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -7.3 (Short-term decline)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a relatively low-risk environment for the overall market.
*   The RSI is relatively high, suggesting that PSA might be getting overbought, which might result in a near-term price correction.
*   The negative change in relative divergence further confirms short-term weakness compared to the S&P 500.

*   The price change is positive, reflecting recent volatility or specific company news.
