**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $296.67
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $291.64
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $288.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $295.68

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating some potential resistance at higher price levels.  The recent price change of $3.17 (from $287.56 to $296.67) reflects a noticeable, potentially significant, positive movement.

* **PPO:** 0.54 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +5.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -29.6% (This is a significant negative figure suggesting substantial underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term.  This requires further scrutiny of the data and methodology used for such prediction).

The technical indicators present a mixed signal. While PPO and the relative strength change suggest upward momentum, the RSI is neutral, and the negative expected return is a significant concern. The relatively low MRI suggests the market risk is currently on the lower side.
