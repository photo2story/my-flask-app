As of the last data point, PSA's cumulative return (79.82%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (127.58%), resulting in a difference of -47.76%.

* **Closing Price:** 337.58 (Last Market: 352.48)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 335.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 333.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 344.46

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend.  The significant difference between the last market price (352.48) and the closing price indicates a recent drop.  This needs to be investigated further for context.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.63 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.25 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -5.29 (Indicates a recent short-term weakening relative to the market)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This needs further elaboration and justification.  A 0% expected return over the long term is unlikely)


The last market price (352.48) being significantly higher than the closing price (337.58) points to a recent sharp decline.  More information is needed to assess the causes and the likelihood of further drops or a potential rebound.

Comparison with analyst estimates for the most recent quarter is crucial for a complete assessment.
