**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Public Storage (PSA) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns and operates self-storage facilities.  The cumulative return of PSA is 53.97%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's cumulative return of 120.36%. The difference is -66.4%, placing it at the 0th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance relative to the broader market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $297.04
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $294.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $295.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $318.78

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend. The small positive change from the previous close ($0.33) is not substantial enough to signal a significant reversal.

* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -2.4% (Indicates a recent weakening of relative strength.)
* **Expected Return:** -1374.9% (This extremely negative value is concerning and likely erroneous.  Further investigation into the calculation methodology is required.
