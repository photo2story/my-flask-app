**6. Overall Analysis:**

PSA demonstrates strong profitability margins, but its recent performance lags the S&P 500 significantly.  The high MDDs in the historical data highlight substantial risk. While the recent price movement suggests some short-term upward momentum,  the negative expected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 and the declining EPS raise concerns. A deeper dive into the reasons for the recent underperformance, including macro-economic factors affecting the self-storage industry and competitive pressures, is needed before making any investment decisions.  Furthermore, resolving the duplicate data entry in the earnings data is crucial for accurate analysis.  Consider reviewing other valuation metrics and comparing PSA to competitors within the self-storage REIT sector before reaching any conclusions.
