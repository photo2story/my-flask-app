**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $272.61
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $289.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $294.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $296.34

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend.  The significant daily drop (-$1.16) needs further investigation for underlying causes.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 26.66 (Suggests oversold conditions, potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.589 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.1 (Short-term upward trend, though contradicted by other indicators)
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk, indicating caution)
* **Expected Return:** -49.2% (This extremely negative expected return is concerning and warrants careful consideration of the underlying assumptions).  The significant negative expected return likely reflects the recent underperformance and the high market risk.

The conflicting signals from the indicators necessitate further analysis of market conditions and PSA's fundamentals.  The substantial daily price drop should trigger a closer examination of the news and events impacting PSA.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PSA's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  While some indicators suggest oversold conditions, the negative earnings trend, high market risk indicator, and significantly negative expected return raise serious concerns.  The large daily price drop warrants investigation into potential negative news or events. Before making any investment decisions, further research into the causes of the recent underperformance and a thorough review of PSA's fundamentals are crucial.  The negative expected return, while potentially a reflection of current market sentiment, should be carefully considered.  The provided data suggests a high level of risk and potential for further downside.
