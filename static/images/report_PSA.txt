The provided data shows a lag of -59.9%, placing it at the 4.5th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news releases (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  No such data was provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Public Storage is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly. While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, the overall trend is bearish. Declining EPS and revenue, coupled with a negative PPO and the price being below its moving averages, paint a concerning picture. The highly negative expected return of -272.9% warrants serious scrutiny and clarification.  Further investigation into the methodology and underlying assumptions of this calculation is crucial. The provided financial data reveals some fluctuation in profitability and equity, adding to the complex picture.  More information on recent news and analyst opinions is necessary for a complete assessment.  The duplicated earnings data entries must be rectified.


**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the currently available data, Public Storage (PSA) presents a high-risk investment.  While the company has historically demonstrated strong profitability, recent performance indicates a significant downturn.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence, including reviewing all recent news, analyst reports, and clarifying the inconsistencies in the supplied financial and earnings data before making any investment decisions.  The extremely negative projected return needs to be reviewed and contextualized.  Additional data is essential for a more comprehensive evaluation.
