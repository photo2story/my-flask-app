**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $295.81

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $314.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $328.59

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (19.78):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce but not guaranteeing a reversal.
* **PPO (-0.51):**  Shows a negative momentum, aligning with the price action below moving averages.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+0.2):** Suggests a slight recent improvement in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-573.1%):** This extremely negative figure needs clarification.  It's likely an error or represents a very specific, highly pessimistic scenario, not a realistic long-term expectation.  A long-term (2+ years) investment in PSA, despite the current underperformance, *could* potentially outperform the S&P 500 depending on future market conditions and PSA's performance, but the -573.1% figure is not reliable.
