PSA has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.

Based on the available data, caution is advised, especially considering the lack of positive growth trends. The 0% expected return aligns with the overall lackluster performance.  More data, particularly analyst ratings and market context are needed for a more robust evaluation.
