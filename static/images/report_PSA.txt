**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Public Storage (PSA) is a self-administered, self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) that acquires, owns, and operates self-storage facilities.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -4.0% | 7.2% | -0.0 | 27.6 |
| 2016-2018  | -24.0% | 7.2% | -0.1 | 27.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 6.0% | 7.9% | -0.7 | 30.2 |
| 2018-2020  | 25.0% | 7.9% | 0.3 | 34.1 |
| 2019-2021  | 84.0% | 7.9% | 0.3 | 56.8 |
| 2020-2022  | 31.0% | 10.5% | 0.3 | 45.3 |
| 2021-2023  | 40.0% | 10.5% | 0.7 | 51.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -26.0% | 12.7% | 0.8 | 52.5 |
| 2023-2025  | 1.0% | 12.7% | 0.9 | 53.7 |

While recent years (2021-2023) show positive alpha, indicating outperformance, the overall picture is inconsistent, with significant periods of underperformance.  The high beta consistently suggests significant sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $306.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $306.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $302.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $302.75

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, indicating recent downward pressure. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential support.  The previous day's closing price was higher, showing a recent drop of approximately 1.6%.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.81 (slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.25 (positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta Relative Divergence (20-day):** +5.2% (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, 2+ years):** -59.7% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further clarification.  The calculation method should be reviewed.  It is likely flawed as it contradicts other data points).


The recent price drop of roughly 1.6% suggests some short-term weakness, but the overall technical indicators are relatively neutral. The extremely negative long-term expected return needs further investigation and clarification of the calculation methodology.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 2.17  | $1.19B      |

| 2024-10-30 | 3.21  | $1.14B      | *(Note: This line is likely a duplicate)*


EPS has shown a recent decline, potentially contributing to the share price drop.  Revenue remains relatively stable. The duplicated entry needs correction.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Public Storage (PSA) presents a mixed picture.  While the company enjoys high profit margins and relatively stable revenue, its recent performance has underperformed the S&P 500 considerably.  The negative long-term expected return, if accurate, is a significant concern and requires investigation of the underlying assumptions. Technical indicators are currently neutral.  The declining EPS in recent quarters warrants monitoring.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the -59.7% expected return calculation and a comparison of PSA's performance to other REITs, is needed before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The high beta suggests significant market risk.
