**6. Overall Analysis:**

PSA's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While the company demonstrates strong profitability and relatively stable revenue, the recent decline in EPS and the projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 raise significant concerns.  The high Beta suggests significant market sensitivity, making it a riskier investment.  The medium-level market risk indicator further supports this assessment.  Before investing, further research into the reasons for the declining EPS and the significant negative expected return is crucial.  The current price is near its moving averages, suggesting potential consolidation. However, given the overall negative outlook, caution is advised.  A long-term investor might consider PSA only after a thorough fundamental analysis and a reassessment of the projected -44.1% expected return against the S&P 500.
