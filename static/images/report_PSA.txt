This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This data was not provided.

Further investigation into the reasons for declining EPS, analysis of recent news and analyst reports, and a clearer understanding of the 0% expected return are essential before forming a conclusion.  The relative underperformance compared to the S&P 500 also requires more in-depth analysis to assess whether this is a temporary trend or a longer-term issue.
