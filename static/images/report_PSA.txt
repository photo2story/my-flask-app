*   **CAGR:** Fluctuating, with negative values in recent periods (2022-2025).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, around 70-80%, indicating significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative in most periods, indicating underperformance relative to the benchmark. Recently, it has become more negative, reflecting worsening relative performance.
*   **Beta:** The beta fluctuates, and more recently seems to be trending to 1, indicating a higher correlation with the general market (and thus, becoming more sensitive to market movements).
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization):** Shows some growth but has decreased recently, potentially influenced by price declines.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 259.15
*   **Previous Close:** 261.37
*   **Change:** -0.85
*   **5-day SMA:** 265.51
*   **20-day SMA:** 270.303
*   **60-day SMA:** 282.625

**Analysis:**

*   The price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This suggests a downward trend in the short, medium, and longer terms. The 5-day SMA being below the 20-day and 60-day SMA reinforces this.
*   The negative change from the previous close further confirms recent downward pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 32.33
*   **PPO:** -0.2487
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-16)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.3 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -4772.6

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI of 32.33 suggests the stock is nearing oversold conditions. A value below 30 is generally considered oversold.
*   The negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, further supporting a downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal indicating a partial "Buy" with a "Caution" warning, based on the MRI, suggests some potential for a rebound, but with associated risks.
*   The MRI is 0.7, indicating that it's medium to invest.
*   A significant negative Expected Return (%) suggests that the model projects substantial underperformance compared to the benchmark if held long-term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   Several news articles highlight negative sentiment:
    *   Decreased stock holdings by Sarasin & Partners LLP.
    *   Valuation evaluation after a recent share price pullback.
    *   Stock plummeting with a 5-day losing streak.
    *   Downgrade by JP Morgan with updated price target.

**Analysis:**

*   The news flow is predominantly negative, which likely contributes to the stock's recent poor performance. Analyst downgrades and institutional selling can further depress the price.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.00)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 320.55 / 350.00 / 290.00

**Analysis:**

*   Despite the recent negative performance and news, the analyst consensus remains a "Buy" with a significant upside potential based on the average target price.  This presents a contradiction to the current market sentiment.
*   Note the lack of specific information about recent rating changes.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출     |
|------------|------|----------|
| 2025-10-29 | 2.63 | 1.22 B$  |
| 2025-07-30 | 1.76 | 1.20 B$  |
| 2025-04-30 | 2.04 | 1.18 B$  |
| 2024-10-30 | 2.17 | 1.19 B$  |
| 2025-10-29 | 2.17 | 1.19 B$  |

**Analysis:**

*   While revenue shows a general upward trend over the past year, EPS has fluctuated. The most recent EPS is the highest in the period, but the previous quarter saw a significant dip. This mixed earnings performance might be contributing to investor uncertainty. It appears that the last value is a duplicate and is probably a data issue.
* It seems revenue grew steadily, but it is important to confirm this

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

PSA is currently facing significant headwinds, leading to substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500. This is supported by the following factors:

*   **Negative Market Sentiment:** Recent news articles and analyst downgrades suggest a negative outlook on the stock.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The stock is trading below key moving averages, and the RSI indicates it's nearing oversold conditions, suggesting short-term decline.
*   **Deteriorating Performance Metrics:** While revenue is growing, the decline in ROE, EPS fluctuation, increasing beta, and negative Alpha raise concerns about profitability and efficiency.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** Analyst consensus remains a "Buy" with significant upside, but this contrasts with the current market sentiment and negative technical/fundamental indicators.
*   **Risk Factors:** While the MRI is medium, the high maximum drawdown (MDD) suggests that there is substantial risk.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, a cautious approach to PSA is warranted. The positive analyst consensus and the potentially oversold RSI could signal a future rebound. However, the negative market sentiment, technical indicators, and declining profitability metrics suggest considerable risks remain. The underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is substantial and concerning. Further research and careful monitoring of the company's performance and news flow are crucial before making any investment decisions.
