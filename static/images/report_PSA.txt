| 2023-2025  | -28.0% | 81.3% | -93.0%  | 1.1   | 46.0   |

**Analysis:** The table indicates the following:

*   **Negative Alpha:**  Alpha is consistently negative, except for the 2020-2023 period. This suggests PSA is generally underperforming relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark (likely the S&P 500), meaning that over this period it has performed worse than expected given its beta. Especially the recent Alpha from 2023~2025 indicates significant underperformance
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates. Recent Beta is greater than 1(2023-2025), which means it has more volatility than market (S&P 500). 
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values are high, indicating significant potential losses from peak to trough during these periods. This highlights volatility and risk.
*   **Capitalization:** The company's market capitalization (Cap) has fluctuated, peaking in 2019-2021 and then declining.
*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is recently negative.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 259.15
*   **Last Market:** Price: 262.08, Previous Close: 259.43, Change: 1.02
*   **5-day SMA:** 265.51
*   **20-day SMA:** 270.303
*   **60-day SMA:** 282.625

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This suggests a short-term downtrend.  The 5-day SMA is closest to the current price, with the 20-day and 60-day SMAs further above, reinforcing the downward momentum. The positive 'change' in the last market data, while positive, is small and may indicate a weak rebound.

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 32.33
*   **PPO:** -0.2487

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.3 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -4772.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 32.33 indicates that the stock is nearing oversold conditions, suggesting a potential for a price reversal (bounce).
*   **PPO:** The Negative Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) indicates negative momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends buying a small amount of the stock (80% of available cash), but with caution, aligning with the medium MRI reading.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence reinforces the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return suggests that current models predict poor future performance compared to S&P 500.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

PSA is currently facing challenges. While the company has strong fundamentals (high profit margins, increasing revenue), the stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and recent price action indicates a downtrend. Technical indicators suggest the stock is approaching oversold territory, but negative momentum persists.

Recent news headlines confirm the price weakness, with institutional selling adding to the bearish sentiment. However, analysts maintain a "Buy" consensus, suggesting that the current price decline may represent a buying opportunity, and may see recovery from it's historical max drawdown. The drastically negative expected return should be regarded warily, but is still notable.

The discrepancy between the stock's performance and analyst expectations warrants further investigation. Potential reasons for the underperformance could include:

*   **Market-wide REIT concerns:** Changes in interest rates, economic outlook, or investor sentiment towards REITs could be impacting the sector as a whole.
*   **Company-specific issues:** Increased competition, changes in management, or operational challenges could be affecting PSA's performance.
*   **Valuation concerns:** Despite the price decline, the stock may still be considered overvalued by some investors.
*   **Negative Market Sentiment**: Current market trends might not be favorable towards PSA

**In conclusion:** PSA's current situation presents a mixed picture. While there are signs of potential value, the significant underperformance, negative price momentum, and institutional selling warrant caution.  Investors should carefully consider the factors contributing to the underperformance and conduct further research before making any investment decisions. The analysts' "Buy" rating suggests that the potential upside might outweigh the risks, but careful due diligence is critical.
