*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 292.27

**Analysis:** The stock price has shown a recent uptick (change of 0.96). However, it is trading below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential short-term downward pressure. The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day, reinforcing this bearish signal.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3234 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 45.85 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.0691

*   **PPO:** The Positive Percentage Oscillator is near zero, suggesting little to no trend momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a buy signal.
*   **Relative Discrepancy Change:** The negative change in relative discrepancy confirms recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The very negative expected return (-537.2%) is a significant concern. This suggests that, based on the model, long-term investment in PSA is projected to substantially underperform the S&P 500. This warrants further investigation into the model's assumptions and PSA's fundamentals.
