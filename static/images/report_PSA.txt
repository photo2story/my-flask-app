### 7. 종합 Analysis

PSA's recent performance has been poor compared to the S&P 500. While the MRI suggests a "Low Risk" environment, other indicators (RSI approaching overbought, negative expected return) and recent news point to potential volatility and uncertainty. The declining trends in EPS, revenue, equity, and ROE are major red flags. **Overall, caution is warranted.** Further research into the reasons for the declining financial metrics and the recent market events is crucial before making any investment decisions. The negative expected return suggests that long-term investment might lead to underperformance compared to the broader market.
