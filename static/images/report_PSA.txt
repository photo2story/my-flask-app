| 2023-2025  | -24.0% | 81.3% | -89.0% | 1.1 | 47.9 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate fluctuates significantly.  Recent periods (2022-2025, 2023-2025) show substantial negative growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk/volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is predominantly negative, implying underperformance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500) after accounting for risk. The negative alpha is very high recent years.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is generally low, suggesting Public Storage is less sensitive to overall market movements compared to the S&P 500. However, recently the Beta is much higher (0.4, 0.1), which is not ideal for a stable value stock.
*   **Cap(B):**  The market capitalization has varied, peaking and then declining recently.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 273.17
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 273.1826, 'previousClose': 271.15, 'change': 0.75}
*   **5-day SMA:** 272.684
*   **20-day SMA:** 273.379
*   **60-day SMA:** 286.1923

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price shows a slight increase in the most recent market data, the most recent market move is a sharp increase.
*   The 5-day SMA is slightly below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This *could* indicate a short-term upward trend, but the 60-day SMA being significantly higher suggests a longer-term downward trend or at least a period of previous higher prices.

**3) Index Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.63
*   **PPO:** 0.32
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90).  Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.7 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -4624.2 (Significant negative excess return compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, but this contradicts other indicators. *This might be a generalized risk assessment not specific to PSA.*
*   The RSI around 50 indicates a neutral condition, neither overbought nor oversold.
*   The PPO being positive suggests a slight upward trend but is quite small.
*   The Hybrid Signal, despite suggesting a "very safe" approach, should be viewed cautiously in light of other negative indicators.
*   The recent decline in relative divergence confirms short-term downward pressure.
*   **The extremely negative Expected Return is a major red flag.**  It indicates a significant projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Valuation Assessment:**  An article discusses assessing valuation, highlighting strong occupancy and tech investments. This suggests positive aspects.
*   **Share Price Decline Evaluation:**  Another article discusses evaluating potential value *after* a recent share price decline. This confirms the decline.
*   **Sector Trends:**  One article mentions Public Storage edging up amid sector trends.
*   **Price Target Lowered:** GuruFocus lowered the price target to $309.
*   **PsA Screening Tips:** This article is irrelevant as it discusses Psoriatic Arthritis, not Public Storage's ticker PSA.
*   **Outperformance Potential:** This article discusses the outperformance potential of PSA.PRL (preferred stock), NOT PSA (common stock).

**Analysis:** The news paints a mixed picture.  While some articles discuss valuation and sector trends, others explicitly acknowledge a recent share price decline and a lowered price target.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.90)
*   **Opinions:** 19
*   **Target Price:** Average $324.26 (High: $350, Low: $293)

**Analysis:**  Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating with a target price significantly above the current price. However, the lowered price target mentioned in the news should be considered a cautionary note.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출    |
|------------|-------|---------|
| 2025-10-29 | 2.63  | 1.22 B$ |

The high MRI value (0.9) needs to be carefully weighted against the other negative indicators. It might not be specific or appropriate in this situation. Further research and due diligence are strongly recommended before making any investment decision. The preferred stock may also be worth considering as one headline mentions outperformance potential.
