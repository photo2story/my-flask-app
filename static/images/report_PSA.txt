**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Public Storage's cumulative return (56.78%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 117.28%. The relative divergence (-60.5%) places PSA in the 10.7th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (where a range of -71.7% to 33.1% is considered).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (beta).  While periods of outperformance (positive Alpha) are evident, particularly from 2019-2021, other periods show significant underperformance (negative Alpha).

| 2021-2023  | 40.0% | 10.5% | 17.0% | 0.7 | 51.4 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $303.35
* **5-day Moving Average:** $301.21
* **20-day Moving Average:** $299.98
* **60-day Moving Average:** $306.40

The price is slightly below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term weakness.  However, it's above its 20-day moving average, implying potential short-term support. The price is considerably below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downward trend.  The recent price change (-$0.276) represents a minor daily decline, not indicating a significant shift.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 63.01 (slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.24 (positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.3% (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -120.9%  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a significant concern.  This suggests a very bearish outlook. Further investigation is needed to understand this projection.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings show a downward trend in EPS and relatively flat revenue.  There's a discrepancy in the data with two entries for 2024-10-30; this needs clarification.


| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |

**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is relatively stable, though a slight downward trend is visible.  Profit margins are consistently high (above 70%), reflecting the company's strong profitability.  Equity has slightly decreased over the period shown.  ROE fluctuates, but mostly sits around 5%, suggesting reasonable but not outstanding return on equity.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PSA's performance has been significantly underperforming the S&P 500, indicated by its negative alpha and large relative divergence.  While its profit margins remain strong and revenue is relatively stable, the declining EPS and a projected extremely negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 are major concerns.  The high Beta underscores its volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Further investigation into the -120.9% expected return and the duplicated earnings data point is crucial before forming any investment decisions.  The current technical indicators are mixed, with the price action suggesting short-term weakness but with some bullish momentum signals.  Caution is advised.  This analysis is based on limited data;  a more comprehensive review including detailed financial statements and future projections is needed for a thorough evaluation.
