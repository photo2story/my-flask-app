| 2023-2025  | -15.0% | 84.0% | -83.0% | 0.5  | 45.5   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate has been volatile, with some positive periods but recent negative figures.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently very high, indicating significant risk and potential for substantial losses.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is generally negative, which means that the investment has underperformed its benchmark index, after accounting for risk. This reinforces the poor relative performance.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally between 0.2 and 0.7, suggesting that PSA is less volatile than the overall market.  A beta of less than 1 indicates a stock that is theoretically less volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market cap has fluctuated, reflecting changing investor sentiment and stock performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 259.5
*   **Last Market:** {'price': 259.5, 'previousClose': 261.13, 'change': -0.62}
*   **5-day SMA:** 260.538
*   **20-day SMA:** 266.429
*   **60-day SMA:** 279.06

**Analysis:**

The stock is currently trading below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This suggests a downward trend in the short, medium, and long term.  The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, further reinforcing this bearish signal. The small negative change from the previous close doesn't yet signal a major shift, but it continues the downward pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 38.80
*   **PPO:** -0.0887
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-16)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.7 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0 (No expected excess return compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the poor performance, the MRI is quite high, indicating high investment recommendation, and there could be a potential for rebound. Note, though, that the Hybrid Signal is only 0.70, indicating caution.
*   **RSI:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 38.80 suggests the stock is nearing oversold conditions (below 30 is typically considered oversold). This *could* indicate a potential for a bounce, but it's not a guarantee.
*   **PPO:** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is negative, indicating the stock's short-term moving average is below its long-term moving average. This confirms the downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal advocates buying 80% with 1 share. The signal advises caution.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Despite the overall negative divergence, the recent divergence has increased. It indicates a potential for a short term bullish movement.
*   **Expected Return:** A 0.0% expected return compared to the S&P 500 suggests that analysts don't anticipate PSA to outperform the market in the long term based on current conditions.

*   **Evaluating Potential Value After Recent Share Price Decline:** Suggests that analysts are considering whether the recent price drop presents a buying opportunity.

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed.  While some institutional investors are increasing their positions (potentially seeing value at lower prices), there's also news of a significant price drop and a losing streak.  The article about evaluating value suggests that the market is uncertain about PSA's future prospects.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 319.10 / 350.00 / 290.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes are listed.

**Analysis:**

Despite the recent underperformance, analysts maintain a "Buy" consensus with a significant average target price well above the current price. This suggests analysts believe the stock is undervalued and has the potential to rebound. However, the lack of recent rating changes suggests that this consensus may be outdated, or that analysts are waiting for more information before adjusting their ratings.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Public Storage (PSA) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, as reflected in its negative cumulative return and divergence.  The stock is currently in a short, medium, and long-term downtrend, trading below its major moving averages. The recent news is mixed, with some institutional buying offset by reports of price declines. The RSI suggests it may be nearing oversold conditions.

While analysts maintain a "Buy" consensus and see significant upside potential, it's important to consider that the data presented paints a more cautious picture. The high MRI suggests that investment is possible, and that there is room for a possible stock rebound. Also, the Hybrid Signal suggests buying 80% of stocks at 1 share. The high and stable profit margins and recent EPS jump are positive signs, but the decreasing equity and fluctuating ROE warrant further investigation. Overall, PSA appears to be a higher-risk investment with potential for a rebound, but requires careful consideration of the conflicting signals.
