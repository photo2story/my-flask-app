The cumulative return for PSA is 52.5%, while VOO's is 119.9%. This represents a difference of **-67.4%**.  The relative divergence of -67.4% places PSA in the 4.1 percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500, indicating substantial underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $294.26

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $294.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $314.85

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The recent price drop of -$1.08 (from $297.48) also reinforces this trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (44.7):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (0.48):** A positive value suggests some bullish momentum, but it is relatively low.
* **Relative Divergence Change (+4.1):** Shows short-term upward momentum, but needs to be viewed with caution, given the larger underperformance trends.
* **Expected Return (-323.5%):** This extremely negative expected return is concerning and likely needs clarification, especially the vast difference from the 2-year CAGR. Further analysis of the methodology is required before trusting this number.  It appears unrealistic given the longer-term historical performance data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PSA has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, showing a large negative divergence.  While some technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce (oversold RSI), the declining earnings, recent price drop and overall negative expected return raise significant concerns.  The high beta suggests that its performance is highly correlated with the overall market which explains some of the underperformance, but doesn't fully justify the extent of the disparity.  The -323.5% expected return needs further investigation and validation; it is extremely low and appears to contradict longer-term CAGR performance.  A thorough review of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and potential future growth prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data raises considerable warning signs.


**8. Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the provided data and should not be considered financial advice.  Conduct thorough independent research before making any investment decisions.  The validity and accuracy of the -323.5% expected return is questionable and requires further scrutiny.
