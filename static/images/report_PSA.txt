*   **20-day SMA:** 265.44

*   **RSI:** 25.55
*   **PPO:** -0.0804

    *   **Recent divergence change:** A short-term rise in relative divergence suggests a slight improvement in PSA's performance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   **Expected Return:** The very large negative Expected Return is a huge red flag. It strongly suggests modeling problems and should not be used in investment decisions.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Public Storage (PSA) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Negative Factors:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, recent price decline, negative alpha, and a large negative expected return(although this is highly suspect, indicating a problem with the return modeling). The decreasing equity could be a warning sign.
*   **Positive Factors:** Strong and growing revenue, high profit margins, oversold RSI suggesting a potential rebound, and a "Buy" consensus from analysts with a significant upside target price.  A medium MRI indicates a moderate level of overall risk. The Vanderbilt University investment shows faith in the company's value.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted. The positive analyst outlook and strong financials are encouraging, but the underperformance and recent price weakness are concerning. Before making any investment decision, it is crucial to conduct further due diligence, focusing on the reasons behind the recent underperformance and the sustainability of the company's revenue growth and profitability. It is important to assess what has made the model produce a huge negative expected return. Finally, any investment decision should consider an investor's individual risk tolerance and investment goals.
