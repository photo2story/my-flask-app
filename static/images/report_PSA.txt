*   **Expected Return:** -404.3% (Significantly negative, indicating projected underperformance vs. S&P 500 over the long term).

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests that the market conditions are generally favorable for investment.
*   The high RSI indicates that the stock may be overbought and could be due for a correction.
*   The PPO is positive, supporting the upward trend.
*   The hybrid signal is a strong buy recommendation. However, the extremely negative expected return is a significant concern. The difference could stem from the models focusing on different time horizons and the impact of the MDD.
*   The increase in relative outperformance over the past 20 days suggests that PSA has been performing better than its benchmark in the short term.
