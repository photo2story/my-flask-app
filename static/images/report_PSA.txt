**Conclusion:**

While Public Storage has strong fundamentals and analysts are optimistic, the recent performance is concerning. The large divergence from the S&P 500, negative Alpha, and current downtrend suggest caution. The negative Expected Return is an outlier and likely incorrect. A potential investor should carefully consider these factors and do further research before investing. The contrast between the analyst consensus and the recent price action warrants further investigation into the reasons for the stock's recent underperformance. The conflicting signals from the MRI and the other indicators suggest that relying solely on the MRI for investment decisions may be risky in this case.
