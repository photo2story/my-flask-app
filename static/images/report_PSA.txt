**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 303.62
* **Last Market Price:** 309.43 (1.91% increase from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** 305.11
* **20-day Moving Average:** 301.74
* **60-day Moving Average:** 303.70

The last market price shows a recent price jump. The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, it's very close to the 60-day moving average, indicating potential for price correction.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.47 (slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.21 (positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** +1.8 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -108.7% (This is a surprisingly negative value and requires further investigation.  It's likely an error in data or calculation, as it suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon. The extreme negative value casts doubt on the validity of this metric.)

The recent price increase (Last-market data) indicates a short-term upward trend, supported by positive PPO.  However, the extremely negative long-term expected return warrants careful consideration and verification of the data source.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Public Storage (PSA) shows a mixed performance picture. While it boasts high profit margins and relatively stable revenue, its performance relative to the S&P 500 has been inconsistent, with periods of significant underperformance. The high beta highlights its sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The provided long-term expected return (-108.7%) needs verification, as it seems implausibly negative.  Recent price action indicates a short-term uptrend but lacks the support of consistent earnings growth.  Further investigation into the earnings decline and the extremely negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A thorough examination of macroeconomic factors affecting the real estate market and a comparison with similar REITs is recommended to gain a comprehensive understanding of PSA's prospects.
