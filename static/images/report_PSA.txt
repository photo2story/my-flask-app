The current price is slightly below both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a slight downward trend in the short term.  The 20-day moving average is further below, indicating a more pronounced downward trend over the medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 49.45 is near the neutral level, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The positive PPO value (0.57) indicates bullish momentum.  The recent negative relative divergence (-6.1%) suggests a short-term downward trend. The MRI of 0.4053 classifies the market risk as medium. The expected return of -44.1% relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a significant concern.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuations in EPS and revenue. There is no clear upward or downward trend readily apparent from this limited data.  More data points would be necessary for a comprehensive analysis.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits any further financial analysis.  This critical information is needed to assess the company's profitability and financial health comprehensively.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PSA has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent periods, indicated by both its lower cumulative return and negative alpha. While some technical indicators suggest potential bullish momentum, the negative long-term expected return and lack of crucial financial data raise significant concerns.  The absence of key financial data prevents a thorough assessment of PSA's financial health. Further investigation is needed, including examining the underlying reasons for the underperformance and obtaining complete financial statements, before making any investment decisions. The high beta highlights its market sensitivity, meaning its performance is closely tied to the overall market's performance.  Therefore, a careful consideration of market conditions is crucial when evaluating PSA.
