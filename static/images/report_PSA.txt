* **20-Day Moving Average:** $316.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $329.49

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (22.63):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce.
* **PPO (-0.58):** Shows a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):**  A positive change of 0.9 suggests a recent short-term upswing, but this is contradicted by the moving averages and the significantly negative Expected Return.
* **Expected Return (-1280.4%):** This extremely negative figure implies a substantial projected loss relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This needs further investigation; the extremely large negative number may be an error in the calculation.  More information about the methodology is required.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The latest quarterly results show a decline in EPS and revenue compared to earlier quarters in 2024.

* **EPS Trend:** EPS has been decreasing, from $3.21 in Q4 2023 to $2.17 in Q4 2024.
* **Revenue Trend:** Revenue growth shows a slight decline from a peak of $1.19B (Q3 2024)  in recent quarters.
* **Comparison:** No information about expected earnings was provided, preventing a comparative analysis of beats or misses.  The data indicates a general downward trend.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable, but profit margins have fluctuated, suggesting variability in operational efficiency.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has decreased slightly over the past year, and ROE has also shown some volatility.  A lower ROE (Return on Equity) in Q3 2024 than in other recent quarters is notable and should be investigated.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions are provided within the given data set.  Information on recent market outlook and any recent earnings announcements within the past 2 days is missing.  This is crucial information for a complete analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PSA has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions and a potential short-term bounce, the negative PPO, price movement below moving averages and extremely negative long-term expected return paint a concerning picture.  The declining EPS and revenue trends, along with volatility in profit margins and ROE, indicate potential underlying operational challenges. The missing information concerning analyst expectations, recent market outlook and news significantly limits the depth of this analysis.  Before making any investment decision, it's crucial to thoroughly investigate the reasons for the dramatic negative expected return, obtain missing data points such as analyst expectations, and review recent news and analyst opinions concerning PSA.  The current data suggests a cautious approach.
