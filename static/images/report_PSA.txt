    *   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha values for most periods indicate that PSA has generally underperformed relative to the risk-free rate, even when accounting for market risk. Recent periods (2022-2025) show particularly negative alpha.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, ranging from -0.2 to 1.4, suggesting that PSA's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market. The rising beta in recent periods suggests that PSA may be becoming more sensitive to market movements, but the effect is minimal in this data set.
