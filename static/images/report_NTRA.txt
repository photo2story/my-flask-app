*   **Relative Divergence:** The negative change in relative divergence reinforces the recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return suggests that, over a longer investment horizon (2+ years), the model predicts significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming a buy and hold strategy and reinvestment of dividends. However, this should be considered in light of the high volatility.
*  **Price Change:** The notable price change (Last-market = {'price': 133.66, 'previousClose': 140.96, 'change': -5.18}) signals a significant short-term negative momentum that should be considered in conjunction with all the other metrics.

### 7. 종합 Analysis

**Summary:**

Natera (NTRA) presents a mixed picture.  While it has outperformed the S&P 500, that outperformance is currently not as strong as it has historically been. The company shows revenue growth and high profit margins, but struggles with profitability (negative EPS and ROE). Recent price action indicates a downtrend, and the RSI suggests it is oversold.  Recent news implies significant activity, potentially related to regulatory or business developments. The model projects a high long-term return relative to the S&P500, but the recommendation is to hold a high cash position and reduce holdings slightly.

**Considerations:**

*   **Profitability:**  The primary concern is the lack of profitability.  Investors need to understand the company's plan to achieve profitability.
*   **Volatility:** The stock is volatile, as evidenced by the high maximum drawdowns in the Alpha/Beta analysis.
*   **News:**  Further investigation into the specific "major business developments, regulatory changes, or market events" is crucial.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Given the volatility and current market conditions, NTRA is likely more suitable for investors with a higher risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the "Hybrid Signal" and considering all the data, a cautious approach is warranted. Given the short-term negative momentum, further price decline can occur. Therefore, it is not a good time to invest. More in-depth fundamental analysis should be done before making investment decisions.
