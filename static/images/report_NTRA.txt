*   **Short-term:** Negative price momentum. RSI suggests potential rebound.
*   **Long-term:** High growth potential based on expected return.
*   **Risk Factors:** Consistent losses, high volatility, sensitivity to market and regulatory news.

**Recommendations:**

*   **For existing holders:** Exercise caution given the recent downturn. Monitor news and earnings closely. The Hybrid Signal suggests a high cash position.
*   **For potential investors:** Consider the high risk/high reward profile. Conduct thorough due diligence, and consider a small initial position to manage risk. Monitor upcoming earnings releases and news for catalysts.
