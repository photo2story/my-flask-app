**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.59B     | 64.91%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.55B     | 63.41%        |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.44B     | 61.79%        |

**Analysis:** Revenue is growing steadily, which is a positive sign. The profit margin is high and consistently above 60%, indicating strong pricing power and efficient operations. However, it's important to remember that profit margin does not equal net profit, as there are other expenses involved.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE      |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $1.25B     | -6.99%   |
| 2025-06-30   | $1.25B     | -8.10%   |
| 2025-03-31   | $1.24B     | -5.40%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $1.20B     | -4.50%   |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.88B     | -3.60%   |

**Analysis:**  Equity has increased significantly since 2024-09-30. However, ROE (Return on Equity) is negative, meaning the company is not generating profit from its equity. While equity has increased, indicating more assets, the negative ROE indicates a poor return on those assets.
