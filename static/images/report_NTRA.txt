**0. Key Figures Summary:**

NTRA has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed, showing a cumulative return far exceeding that of the benchmark index.  However, recent performance indicates a considerable decline.  The company's financial statements reveal some inconsistencies that need further investigation.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Natera Inc. (NTRA) is a privately held genetic testing company.

* **Cumulative Return (NTRA):** 125.49%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 51.86%

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows a volatile performance history.  While NTRA has exhibited periods of significant outperformance (alphas above 0, particularly during 2017-2020), it has also experienced substantial drawdowns (negative CAGRs, especially in 2021-2023). The high beta values suggest significant market sensitivity.  The fluctuating beta indicates varying degrees of market correlation over time.

* **Last Market Price:** $133.08 (a decrease of $5.18)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $138.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $145.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $158.19

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The significant drop in the last market price (-3.75) indicates a possible short-term correction or a more sustained decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)  The MRI suggests a relatively high level of risk associated with the stock.
* **RSI:** 40.21 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.4741 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** +1.4 (Short-term upward trend, but needs to be interpreted with caution given the overall negative trend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 148.2% (This represents a substantial premium to the S&P 500's expected return over the long term, but high risk is implied). The large price drop in the "Last Market" data point should be considered in evaluating this high expected return, as it suggests a possible near-term risk of further declines.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.26  | $0.44B       |
| 2024-08-09 | -$0.30  | $0.41B       |
| 2024-05-10 | -$0.56  | $0.37B       |
| 2023-11-09 | -$0.95  | $0.27B       |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.95  | $0.27B       |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-11-12.  Revenue is increasing, but the company is consistently reporting negative EPS, indicating losses.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for these losses and the sustainability of revenue growth.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.48B  | 62.94%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B  | 61.79%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.41B  | 58.83%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.37B  | 56.72%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.31B  | 51.38%        |

Revenue shows a clear upward trend. However, while profit margins are high, the company is still unprofitable, as shown by the negative EPS.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE      |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.20B   | -4.50%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.88B   | -3.60%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.84B   | -4.48%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.79B   | -8.51%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.77B   | -10.20%  |

Negative ROE consistently indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity.  This needs further investigation to determine if this is a temporary issue or a longer-term problem.  The significant increase in equity from Q3 2024 to Q4 2024 warrants further investigation into the cause.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA has demonstrated significant past outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent performance has been negative, and the company is currently operating at a loss despite growing revenue and high profit margins.  The negative ROE is concerning and requires further analysis to determine its underlying causes.  The high market risk indicator and bearish technical indicators suggest caution. The high projected long-term return should be considered with a significant dose of skepticism given the current negative performance.  A deep dive into the company's financials and operational strategies is necessary to better assess the investment risk and potential.  The seemingly high expected return should be carefully considered in light of the recent price drop and ongoing losses.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for high reward against the significant risks identified in this analysis.
