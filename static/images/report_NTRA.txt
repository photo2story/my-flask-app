**Conclusion:**

While Natera shows promise in terms of revenue growth, profit margins, and analyst sentiment, the consistent lack of profitability, significant underperformance, and negative expected return raise substantial concerns. A potential investor would need to carefully weigh the potential for future growth against the significant risks and historical underperformance. Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative expected return and the sustainability of the high profit margins is warranted. The negative expected return is so severe it could suggest issues that may need to be investigated by a trained professional.
