The high volatility and fluctuating beta indicate significant market sensitivity.  Positive alpha in several periods suggests periods of outperformance.  The large swings in CAGR highlight substantial risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $151.74
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $148.70
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $145.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $155.90

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but below the 60-day average, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend but a longer-term downward trend might be underway.  The recent price increase of $2.22 (from $148.45) shows a minor positive trend which is not sufficient to cause concern about sharp fluctuations.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 51.39 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought or oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.05 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.9 (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 150.1% (This is a substantial expected return, needing further validation).  Given the significant risk highlighted in other sections, this should be treated with caution.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.26 | $0.44B        |
| 2024-08-09 | -$0.30 | $0.41B        |
| 2024-05-10 | -$0.56 | $0.37B        |
| 2023-11-09 | -$0.95 | $0.27B        |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.95 | $0.27B        |

There seems to be a mistake in the data; the same values appear twice for November 12th.  Regardless of this duplication, the company is currently unprofitable, with revenue showing some growth but EPS remains negative.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.48B | 62.94%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B | 61.79%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.41B | 58.83%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.37B | 56.72%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.31B | 51.38%       |

Revenue is growing, and profit margins are healthy, though profitability is not reflected in EPS.  Further investigation is required to understand the discrepancy.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity  | ROE    |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.20B | -4.50% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.88B | -3.60% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.84B | -4.48% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.79B | -8.51% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.77B | -10.20% |

Negative ROE indicates the company is not generating returns on its equity.  This is a significant concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA has shown substantial outperformance against the S&P 500 in the past, but this is coupled with high volatility and negative ROE.  While revenue is growing and profit margins are strong, the company is currently unprofitable (negative EPS). The high expected return needs to be considered in light of the significant risk inherent in the stock's volatility and negative ROE.  Further investigation into the causes of the negative EPS, despite positive revenue and profit margins, is crucial.  A long-term investment requires careful consideration of the high risk involved. The data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings data) also require clarification before drawing firm conclusions.
