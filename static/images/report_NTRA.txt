## Natera Inc. (NTRA) Stock Analysis

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

NTRA's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  Recent price action shows a downward trend, but indicators suggest a mixed outlook.  Earnings show revenue growth but remain unprofitable.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Natera Inc. (NTRA) is a genetic testing company offering a range of testing services.

* **Cumulative Return:** NTRA: 401.86%, VOO: 91.19%
* **Return Difference:** NTRA outperformed VOO by 310.7 percentage points at the end of the period.  This places it in the 47.2nd percentile of its historical relative performance range (max: 706.7, min: -43.2).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high volatility and varying levels of market sensitivity (Beta) over time.  High Alpha values in some years indicate periods of significant outperformance compared to the market, while negative CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in other periods highlights significant downside risk.  Note the extremely high CAGR values are likely driven by short periods of outperformance and should not be taken as indicative of consistent performance.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures further support this point.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $148.30
* **Last Market Price:** $140.82 (Down $2.17 from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $151.54
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $146.64
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $161.26

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. The recent price drop of $2.17 might indicate increased selling pressure, or it could simply be a minor fluctuation within this trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.85 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.89 (Positive; suggesting bullish momentum, though it's important to look at the trend of the PPO over time as well.)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -0.7 (Short-term bearish)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 119.4% (Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 expected over the long term, though this is highly speculative).


The indicators present a mixed picture.  While the RSI isn't overbought and the PPO is positive, the recent price drop and negative relative strength change suggest caution. The high expected return should be treated with skepticism given the company's historical volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company is currently experiencing losses, although revenue is growing.  This needs further investigation to determine the cause of the losses and the sustainability of the revenue growth.  The duplication of the November 12th, 2024 entry suggests an error in the data provided.

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue growth is evident, while profit margins are relatively high but declining slightly.  However, Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating returns on shareholder investment.  This is a critical area of concern.

|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.48B | 62.94%       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA has demonstrated significant past outperformance against the S&P 500, but this has been highly volatile.  The company shows revenue growth, but consistently negative ROE and ongoing losses are major red flags.  The recent price action is bearish, and while some indicators suggest potential, the fundamental weaknesses of the company need to be carefully considered.  A long-term investment might be considered only after thorough due diligence and an understanding of the risks involved.  The projected long-term outperformance should be viewed with extreme caution.  Further research into the causes of the losses and the sustainability of revenue growth is crucial before making any investment decisions.
