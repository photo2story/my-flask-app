| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -6.0% | 62.4% | -0.1 | 1.3 |
| 2016-2018  | 29.0% | 80.1% | 0.2 | 2.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 159.0% | 80.1% | 0.9 | 4.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 530.0% | 80.1% | 0.4 | 14.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 355.0% | 62.9% | 0.2 | 13.4 |

| 2022-2024  | -75.0% | 70.6% | 1.2 | 22.7 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $143.28
* **Previous Close:** $151.97
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $139.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $145.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $156.81

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The significant drop from the previous close (-5.72) indicates a recent sharp decline.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.22 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.29 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.9 (Short-term bearish)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 170.5% (significantly higher than S&P 500)

The recent price drop (-5.72) reflects a significant negative change that needs further investigation to understand the underlying causes.  Despite a medium risk level, the high expected return suggests potential for long-term growth exceeding the S&P 500, but this is highly dependent on mitigating factors associated with the recent price decline and the volatility observed in the Alpha/Beta analysis.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.26   | $0.44 B       |
| 2024-08-09 | -$0.30   | $0.41 B       |
| 2024-05-10 | -$0.56   | $0.37 B       |
| 2023-11-09 | -$0.95   | $0.27 B       |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.95   | $0.27 B       | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Earnings show consistent losses (negative EPS) although revenue is increasing. This requires a further look into the company's expense structure to understand the profitability issues.  The duplicate entry on 2024-11-12 needs clarification.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.48B | 62.94% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B | 61.79% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.41B | 58.83% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.37B | 56.72% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.31B | 51.38% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.20B | -4.50% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.88B | -3.60% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.84B | -4.48% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.79B | -8.51% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.77B | -10.20% |


Revenue is growing, and profit margins are healthy despite negative ROE. Negative ROE suggests the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  Further investigation into the balance sheet is required to understand this disparity.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

NTRA shows significant long-term growth potential, with a high projected return exceeding the S&P 500. However, the recent sharp price drop and inconsistent performance relative to the market (as indicated by fluctuating alpha and high beta values) present substantial risk. While revenue growth and healthy profit margins are positive signs, the negative ROE and consistently negative EPS raise concerns about profitability.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price drop and the negative ROE is critical before making any investment decisions.  A deeper dive into the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and future growth strategy is recommended before assessing the validity of the high projected return.
