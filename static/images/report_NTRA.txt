* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)

* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 105.9% (Significant potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but subject to high risk)

The technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, with the stock trading in oversold territory (RSI) but still displaying negative momentum (PPO). The significant price drop should be investigated further.  The high expected return is appealing, but the high market risk and volatile past performance need consideration.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Natera shows consistent negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) over the reported periods, with declining revenues, signaling a potentially concerning financial situation.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind these negative earnings.

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.26   | $0.44 B     |

**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability tables show increasing revenue, though it is important to notice that the profit margins are falling, despite this revenue increase. The Capital and Profitability table shows negative ROE (Return on Equity), indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity investment.  This needs further investigation to understand the underlying causes.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.48B     | 62.94%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.44B     | 61.79%        |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA has shown periods of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this has been accompanied by high volatility and periods of substantial underperformance.  The recent price drop and negative earnings are concerning. While the long-term expected return is high, the high risk, negative ROE, and inconsistent performance warrant caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative EPS, declining profit margins despite revenue growth, and the recent price drop is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data provided suggests significant risk, and investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in NTRA.  Consulting with a financial advisor is recommended.
