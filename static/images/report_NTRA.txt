**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Natera Inc. is a company focused on developing and commercializing genetic testing products.  Over the observed period, NTRA significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return 53.9 percentage points higher. The relative divergence of 15.3% suggests that this outperformance is relatively moderate compared to its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500.  However, the substantial variation in Alpha and Beta values across different years indicates high volatility and inconsistency in performance.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -6.0% | 62.4% | -0.1 | 1.2 |

| 2017-2019  | 159.0% | 80.1% | 1.3 | 4.6 |
| 2018-2020  | 530.0% | 80.1% | 0.7 | 13.5 |
| 2019-2021  | 355.0% | 62.9% | 0.3 | 12.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -119.0% | 62.9% | 0.3 | 5.5 |

The high variability in CAGR, MDD (Maximum Drawdown), Alpha, and Beta highlights significant risk associated with investing in NTRA.  The company's performance is highly sensitive to market movements (high Beta values in several periods) and its alpha (excess return over the market) fluctuates wildly.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $156.66
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $153.37
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $147.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $151.79

The price is slightly above its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, but below the 20-day moving average indicates some recent price consolidation or a minor pullback.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 61.18 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.6972 (Positive value suggests an upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Minor short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 97.2% (This represents a substantial projected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon, exceeding 2 years.  However, this should be viewed with caution given the historical volatility exhibited by the stock.)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.26 | $0.44 B      |
| 2024-08-09 | -$0.30 | $0.41 B      |
| 2024-05-10 | -$0.56 | $0.37 B      |
| 2023-11-09 | -$0.95 | $0.27 B      |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.95 | $0.27 B      |

There seems to be a duplicate entry for 2024-11-12.  Regardless, the data shows consistent negative EPS, indicating the company is currently operating at a loss. Revenue shows a slight upward trend, but further analysis is needed to determine the profitability and sustainability of this growth.  The repeated -$0.95 data point may be an error that should be clarified.

**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data is available, limiting a comprehensive financial analysis.  This absence of crucial financial data significantly hinders a thorough evaluation of the company's financial health and prospects.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the observed period, but this is coupled with extremely high volatility.  The consistent negative EPS and lack of comprehensive financial data raise concerns about the company's profitability and long-term sustainability.  While the projected long-term expected return is high, the significant risk (as evidenced by the erratic Alpha and Beta values and high MDD) should be carefully considered.  Further investigation into the company's financials and business model is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The missing financial data and the duplicate earnings data entry necessitate further clarification.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence.
