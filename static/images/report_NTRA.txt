High Alpha values (e.g., 2017-2019, 2018-2020) suggest periods of significant outperformance, while negative Alphas reflect underperformance.  The high volatility is evident in the substantial swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) also shows significant growth over time.

* **Closing Price:** $148.04
* **5-day Moving Average:** $142.76
* **20-day Moving Average:** $145.46
* **60-day Moving Average:** $156.44

The recent price of $148.04 shows a 3.32 increase from the previous close.  The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.87 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)

The MRI suggests a high-risk profile.  The RSI is near the neutral zone, while the positive PPO indicates potential bullish momentum. The negative change in relative divergence (-0.5) points to a recent short-term price decline.  The significant price change of $3.32 from the previous close indicates a recent upward movement, which could be interpreted as a price jump following recent financial news, however, further investigation into the underlying events causing this movement is needed. The projected long-term expected return is substantially higher than the VOO.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2023-12-31 | $0.77B    | -10.20%      |


Revenue is growing steadily, and profit margins remain high, despite showing a slightly decreasing trend.  However, the negative ROE (Return on Equity) indicates that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  This is a significant concern that requires further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a high projected long-term return. However, the company is currently unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE.  Recent price action shows short-term downward pressure, though the price recently experienced an increase. The high market risk indicator adds to the uncertainty. While the long-term prospects appear positive based on the expected return,  investors should carefully consider the negative profitability and high risk before making any investment decisions.  Further analysis, including a thorough examination of the financial statements and underlying business operations, is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The duplicated data entry in the earnings report needs immediate clarification.
