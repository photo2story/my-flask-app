| 2025-11-07  | -0.26 | 0.44 B$   |

*   **Analysis:** Natera is consistently generating revenue growth.  However, the company is not yet profitable, evidenced by negative EPS values in all recent quarters. The EPS losses are fluctuating, but the most recent quarter shows a smaller loss than the previous one.  This could suggest progress towards profitability, but it needs to be sustained.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.59B  | 64.91%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.55B  | 63.41%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.50B  | 63.12%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.48B  | 62.94%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.44B  | 61.79%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE    |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| 2025-09-30   | $1.25B  | -6.99% |
| 2025-06-30   | $1.25B  | -8.10% |
| 2025-03-31   | $1.24B  | -5.40% |
| 2024-12-31   | $1.20B  | -4.50% |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.88B  | -3.60% |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue is consistently growing, and the profit margin is strong and increasing slightly. Equity has increased significantly, indicating the company is building its financial base. However, the negative ROE values confirm that Natera is currently not profitable.  The increasing revenue and high profit margin are positives that could lead to profitability in the future.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Strong Points:**
    *   Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 historically.
    *   Strong revenue growth and high-profit margins.
    *   Positive analyst consensus.
    *   Positive News: clinical trial in progress
    *   MRI indicates medium level of investment risk

*   **Weak Points:**
    *   High volatility (high MDD).
    *   Currently unprofitable (negative EPS and ROE).
    *   Concerningly negative expected return (-46.9%), suggesting potential long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
    *   Short term downward trend suggested by technical analysis
    *   News article cautions about potentially high valuation

*   **Overall:** Natera is a high-growth, high-risk stock. It has shown significant outperformance, but it is still unprofitable and exhibits considerable volatility. The overwhelmingly negative expected return is a big concern. The positive news from the clinical trial should be watched closely as it could be a catalyst for future price movements.

*   **Recommendation:** Proceed with caution. While analyst ratings are positive, the high volatility, current price relative to moving averages, and the significantly negative projected return suggest further investigation is required.
