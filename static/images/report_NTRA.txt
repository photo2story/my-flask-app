**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.26 | $0.44B        |
| 2024-08-09 | -$0.30 | $0.41B        |

| 2024-11-12 | -$0.95 | $0.27B        |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-11-12.  Revenue is increasing, but the company is consistently reporting negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses. This needs further investigation.  The discrepancy between the two 2024-11-12 entries should be clarified.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

NTRA has historically shown strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent performance indicates substantial volatility and declining profitability despite increasing revenue.  The negative EPS, negative ROE, and high market risk (as indicated by high beta and MRI) are serious concerns.  The high predicted long-term return should be viewed cautiously due to the significant risk involved.  Further investigation into the reasons for negative profitability and the duplicate earnings data entry is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A thorough analysis of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is needed for a comprehensive assessment.  The currently oversold conditions suggested by the RSI should be interpreted carefully considering the underlying negative trends.
