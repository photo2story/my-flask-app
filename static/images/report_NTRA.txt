**7. Overall Analysis & Conclusion**

Natera Inc. (NTRA) presents a mixed picture.  On one hand, it has demonstrated the potential for significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, as evidenced by its past returns. The company is also growing its revenue at a healthy pace.  A low MRI value means that the risk is not that high compare to the past.

However, several factors raise concerns:

*   **Lack of Profitability:** The company is consistently unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE. The high profit margin is negated by high operating costs.
*   **High Volatility:** The stock exhibits significant volatility and has a high maximum drawdown, indicating substantial risk.
*   **Recent Downtrend:**  The current price is below its moving averages, and the short-term outlook is bearish.
*   **Cautionary Signals:** The hybrid signal and analyst discussions suggest a cautious approach.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach to NTRA is warranted.  While the long-term expected return is attractive, the company's lack of profitability, high volatility, and recent downtrend present significant risks.  Investors should carefully weigh these risks against the potential rewards and conduct further due diligence, including monitoring upcoming earnings reports and news events.  Consider a smaller position size or waiting for more positive signals before increasing exposure.
