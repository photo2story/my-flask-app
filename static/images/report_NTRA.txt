**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA has shown significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests a potential bearish trend.  While revenue and profit margins are improving, the company is still unprofitable, and the stock exhibits high volatility. The high expected long-term return should be carefully weighed against the considerable risk inherent in this investment.  Further investigation into the reasons for losses and the sustainability of revenue growth is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high Beta indicates substantial market sensitivity; therefore, a broader market downturn could significantly impact NTRA's performance.
