**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is consistently growing, and the profit margin is impressively high and stable, indicating efficient operations and strong pricing power.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is also growing, suggesting the company is retaining or raising capital effectively. However, the ROE (Return on Equity) is negative, aligning with the negative EPS, indicating the company is not generating profit from its equity. The recent ROE of -8.10% is notably lower than previous quarters, mirroring the concerning EPS trend.

### 7. Overall Analysis and Summary

NTRA has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500. Recent price action is bullish based on moving averages and buy signals. However, the RSI indicates overbought conditions, and recent news suggests volatility.

The key concern is profitability. While revenue and profit margins are strong, the company is still losing money (negative EPS and ROE). This is reflected in the negative alpha during certain periods, highlighting periods where the company's performance lagged behind the market.

The high expected return (185.9%) suggests significant long-term growth potential, but this is contingent on the company achieving profitability.

**In conclusion:** NTRA presents a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. Investors should monitor the company's progress towards profitability closely. The positive revenue trend and market interest are encouraging, but the lack of current profits is a significant concern.
