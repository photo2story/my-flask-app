|:------------|-------:|-------:|--------:|-------:|-------:|
| 2024-2026  | 136.0% | 80.5% | 34.0% | -0.1 | 32.1 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** A very high CAGR of 136.0% indicates rapid growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** A significant MDD of 80.5% suggests high volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** The positive Alpha of 34.0% indicates that NTRA has outperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis. It implies the stock has generated returns above what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:** A slightly negative Beta of -0.1 suggests that NTRA has a very weak negative correlation with the market. It means the stock price tends to move slightly in the opposite direction of the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization of $32.1 Billion.

*   **5-day SMA:** 233.19
*   **20-day SMA:** 233.63
*   **60-day SMA:** 210.63

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a slight downward trend in the short term. However, the 60-day SMA is significantly lower, indicating a stronger upward trend over the past couple of months. The very small change in the last market price suggests price stability, but it should be considered in conjunction with other data.

**3) Index Indicators Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.53
*   **PPO:** -0.68
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90), monthly invest 0.8% of total investment.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.4 (Downward trend)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -51.8%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The high MRI suggests a favorable investment climate, but this indicator alone shouldn't be the sole basis for investment.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 40.53 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), potentially indicating a buying opportunity, but it is not there yet.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO (-0.68) suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal's recommendation to buy and the "very safe" label, along with the high MRI, seem to contradict the expected return, RSI and PPO. This could indicate a disconnect between the short-term outlook and the long-term investment strategy.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence suggests a recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The very negative expected return (-51.8%) suggests a potential long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500. This is concerning and needs further investigation.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Natera Inc. (NTRA) is a rapidly growing company in the genetic testing space, outperforming the S&P 500 in recent years.  Analysts are largely bullish, reflected in the Strong Buy consensus and high target price.  Revenue and profit margins are increasing, indicating strong business performance.

**However, there are some significant concerns:**

*   **Lack of Profitability:** The company is not yet profitable, as evidenced by negative EPS and negative ROE, though improving.
*   **High Volatility:** The high MDD suggests significant price fluctuations.
*  **Contradictory Signals:** The hybrid signal is contradicting the negative expected return, RSI and PPO.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 is a major red flag and warrants further investigation. This could be due to high valuation, expected future dilution, or concerns about long-term growth prospects.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based solely on this data, a cautious approach is warranted. While NTRA has shown strong growth and analysts are optimistic, the lack of profitability, high volatility, and, most importantly, the negative expected return are concerning. Potential investors should conduct thorough due diligence, understand the risks associated with the stock, and carefully consider their investment horizon and risk tolerance. The "Hold" rating from Seeking Alpha seems appropriate in this context. Don't rely solely on the high MRI; consider the full picture. It would be good to understand the reasons for the negative expected return to make an informed decision.
