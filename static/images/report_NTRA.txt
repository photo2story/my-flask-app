**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Natera Inc. is a company specializing in genetic testing and diagnostics.  Its cumulative return of 378.5% drastically outpaces the S&P 500's 89.8%, resulting in a substantial divergence.  The relative divergence of 44.3% indicates that NTRA's performance is positioned in the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and varying levels of market sensitivity (Beta).  While several periods show strong outperformance (high Alpha), others show significant underperformance, even negative returns.  This highlights the high risk associated with NTRA.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) throughout the period reflects growth but doesn't necessarily correlate with consistent profitability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA demonstrates a history of significant outperformance against the S&P 500, but this is coupled with extreme volatility and inconsistent profitability.  While revenue is increasing, consistently negative EPS and ROE raise significant concerns about the company's long-term financial health.  The high expected return should be viewed cautiously given the substantial risk.  A deep dive into the reasons for negative ROE, despite high profit margins, is crucial. Further investigation into the company's business model and future growth prospects is needed before making any investment decisions.  The current market indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, despite a positive long-term expected return.  Investors should exercise caution and consider their risk tolerance carefully.
