### 7. 종합 Analysis

NTRA exhibits high growth potential with increasing revenue and a high profit margin. However, it is currently unprofitable, as reflected by negative EPS and ROE.  The stock has shown significant volatility and risk, as indicated by the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values, but recent news suggests the company is going through major developments.  The Market Risk Indicator is low, and the short-term trend is positive, but caution is advised due to the hybrid signal and historical volatility. The very high expected return should be viewed with skepticism given the company's past performance. Investors should closely monitor earnings reports and company announcements.
