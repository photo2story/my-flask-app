## Natera Inc. (NTRA) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Natera Inc. (NTRA) is a genetic testing company.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO), but recent performance shows volatility and negative growth.  Further analysis is needed to determine future investment potential.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NTRA's cumulative return of 126.37% significantly exceeds the S&P 500's return of 62.37% (a difference of 64.0%).  The relative divergence of 15.5% indicates that NTRA's performance is in the upper portion of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500. However, this doesn't guarantee future outperformance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals significant volatility in NTRA's performance and varying exposure to market risk (Beta).  High CAGR periods (e.g., 2017-2019, 2018-2020) are followed by substantial negative returns, indicating inherent risk.  The consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) underscores this risk profile.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -6.0% | 62.4% | -0.1 | 1.2 |
| 2016-2018  | 29.0% | 80.1% | 0.2 | 1.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 159.0% | 80.1% | 0.9 | 4.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 530.0% | 80.1% | 0.4 | 13.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 355.0% | 62.9% | 0.2 | 12.6 |
| 2020-2022  | -119.0% | 62.9% | 0.2 | 5.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -482.0% | 69.9% | 1.1 | 8.5 |
| 2022-2024  | -75.0% | 70.6% | 1.2 | 21.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 75.0% | 72.8% | 0.8 | 20.1 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $148.45
* **5-day Moving Average:** $144.79
* **20-day Moving Average:** $145.42
* **60-day Moving Average:** $156.11

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent small price increase (0.28) is not significant enough to indicate a major reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.61 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.80 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -1.4 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 158.6% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is projected, but this requires validation with additional analysis given the recent volatility)

The high MRI value indicates high risk. The price increase is minimal and doesnâ€™t counteract the negative technical indicators. The high expected return needs further justification considering the company's recent financial performance and high volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

NTRA has been experiencing consistent net losses.  Revenue has shown some growth but not enough to offset significant losses.  Further investigation is needed to understand the causes of these losses.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NTRA has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent performance, including negative EPS, negative ROE, and high volatility, raises significant concerns. The high expected return projection needs substantial further validation and a deeper dive into the underlying drivers of revenue growth and the reasons for consistent losses.  Before investing, thorough due diligence, including a detailed analysis of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is crucial.  The high risk associated with this stock needs to be carefully considered.
