**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $148.08
* **5-day Moving Average:** $149.30
* **20-day Moving Average:** $145.59
* **60-day Moving Average:** $155.31

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, the price is relatively close to its 20-day moving average.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 53.13 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.8 (Short-term upward trend)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture.  The recent price drop (-$1.39) is relatively small and doesn't indicate a sharp reversal.  The long-term expected return of 109.3% significantly exceeds the expected return of the S&P 500, suggesting a potentially attractive investment for a long-term horizon (2+ years), assuming the trend continues.

The company is currently experiencing losses, although revenue is increasing.  The duplicated data point for 2024-11-12 needs clarification.  Further investigation into the reasons for the losses and the consistency of revenue growth is needed.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|

| 2023-12-31 | $0.31B | 51.38%        |

Revenue shows a steady increase, although the profit margins, while high, show a slight downward trend.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE    |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.20B | -4.50% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.88B | -3.60% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Natera (NTRA) has shown substantial outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, but with periods of significant volatility. While recent price action indicates a potential short-term bearish trend, the positive long-term expected return and increasing revenue, despite current losses and negative ROE, present a complex picture.  Further investigation into the reasons for losses, the consistency of revenue growth, and the significant fluctuations in equity and Beta are crucial before drawing definitive conclusions.  The high profit margins suggest potential for future profitability if the company can address its current losses and achieve positive ROE.  A long-term investment approach might be considered, but only after careful due diligence considering the company's inherent volatility and need for profitability.  The duplicated earnings data point requires further clarification.
