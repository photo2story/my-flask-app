## Natera Inc. (NTRA) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Natera Inc. (NTRA) is a molecular diagnostics company offering non-invasive prenatal testing and other genetic testing services.  The company shows significant historical volatility and a recent period of underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While the long-term expected return is high, short-term performance is weak and requires further analysis before investment.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

NTRA's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO) (116.14% vs 67.20%).  The difference is 48.9%, placing it at the 14.5th percentile of its historical range of relative performance against VOO (max: 622.1%, min: -48.4%).  However, this historical outperformance is not consistent across all time periods as indicated by the highly volatile CAGR in the provided data.

The high beta values across several periods illustrate NTRA's high sensitivity to market movements. The volatile alpha values show inconsistent outperformance relative to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $142.23
* **Previous Close:** $148.08
* **5-day Moving Average:** $148.13
* **20-day Moving Average:** $145.14
* **60-day Moving Average:** $154.82

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend. The recent price change of -3.95 indicates a noticeable negative price shift.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 50.59 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.6358 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, although the recent price drop casts doubt on this)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.6 (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 115.4% (Long-term, over two years, exceeding S&P 500 returns significantly)

The recent price drop contradicts the positive PPO. The negative divergence also shows a bearish sentiment. While the long-term expected return is high, the short-term indicators are less positive. The substantial price drop should be investigated for any underlying causes.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.26 | $0.44B       |
| 2024-08-09 | -$0.30 | $0.41B       |
| 2024-05-10 | -$0.56 | $0.37B       |
| 2023-11-09 | -$0.95 | $0.27B       |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.95 | $0.27B       | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Revenue is showing a positive trend, although EPS remains negative, indicating ongoing losses.  The duplicate entry for November 12th, 2024 needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.48B   | 62.94%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.44B   | 61.79%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.41B   | 58.83%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.37B   | 56.72%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.31B   | 51.38%        |

Revenue is increasing, and profit margins remain relatively high despite negative EPS. This suggests potential operational efficiency but also indicates that the company's cost structure needs further investigation to achieve profitability.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE      |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| 2024-12-31  | $1.20B   | -4.50%   |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.88B   | -3.60%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.84B   | -4.48%   |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.79B   | -8.51%   |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.77B   | -10.20%  |

Negative ROE indicates the company is not generating returns on its equity. While equity is increasing, the negative ROE is a serious concern and needs to be addressed.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA shows high potential for long-term growth based on its high projected return. However, several concerns need attention:

* **Short-term volatility:** The recent price drop and negative divergences indicate a bearish short-term outlook.
* **Negative EPS and ROE:**  The company is not currently profitable, raising significant financial concerns.
* **High Beta:**  The stock is highly sensitive to market fluctuations.
* **Data discrepancies:** The duplicated earnings data requires clarification.

Before investing in NTRA, a thorough investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop, the negative EPS and ROE, and the long-term viability of the business model is crucial. While the long-term expected return is attractive, the considerable short-term risks must be carefully evaluated.  Further analysis of the companyâ€™s cost structure and strategies for achieving profitability is essential before making any investment decision.
