    *   Strong Revenue growth and high Profit Margins.
    *   Analysts have a "Strong Buy" consensus and see upside potential.
    *   Significant investment by a billionaire investor.
*   **Negatives:**
    *   Consistently negative EPS and ROE, indicating a lack of profitability.
    *   High Maximum Drawdown and Beta values reflect high volatility.
    *   Negative Expected Return compared to S&P 500.
    *   Recent short-term downward momentum in the stock price.
    *   Recent relative divergence change indicates a decline compared to its peers.
    *   The MRI suggests medium risk.
    *   The Hybrid Signal is contrarian.

**Conclusion:**

Natera is a high-growth, high-risk stock. While it has demonstrated the potential for significant returns, it is currently unprofitable and volatile. Recent indicators suggest a short-term correction or period of underperformance. The analyst consensus remains positive, but negative profitability and expected future return should be carefully considered. The news is mixed, but the billionaire investor and analyst optimism provide some support.
