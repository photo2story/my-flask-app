| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -0.26     | $0.44 B       |

The company is currently reporting negative EPS, indicating losses. While revenue shows a general upward trend, it's crucial to consider the significant losses against the revenue figures.  The duplicate entry for November 12, 2024, raises concerns about data accuracy.


**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data is available, hindering a comprehensive financial analysis.  This lack of data is a significant limitation in assessing the company's financial health and sustainability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA exhibits significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with considerable volatility.  Recent performance shows mixed signals from technical indicators, while fundamental analysis is hampered by the lack of complete financial data and persistent negative EPS. The high volatility and the missing financial data make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions.  Further investigation into the company's financials and business model is essential before making any investment decisions.  The high expected return should be viewed with caution due to the inherent risks identified.
