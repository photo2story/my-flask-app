**7. 종합 Analysis and Recommendation:**

Natera Inc. presents a mixed picture. While the company has historically outperformed the S&P 500 and is showing revenue growth, several factors warrant caution:

*   **Recent Underperformance:** Recent indicators show a narrowing of the performance gap with the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Earnings:** The company is not currently profitable, with consistent negative EPS and negative ROE.
*   **High Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility, as indicated by the maximum drawdown and recent news.
*   **Hybrid Signal & Technicals:** The hybrid signal suggests caution, and the negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is low, which might signal an oversold condition. But other negative signals suggest this may not be a strong buy signal.
*   **Revenue increasing:** Revenues are on the rise.
*   **High Profit Margins:** Very high profit margins with increasing trend is positive

**Recommendation:** Given the recent underperformance, lack of profitability, and high volatility, a cautious approach is advised. The hybrid signal recommendation to reduce holdings and increase cash is prudent. Investors should closely monitor company news, earnings releases, and market dynamics before making any investment decisions. The low RSI might present a speculative opportunity, but should be approached with caution and a sound risk management strategy. Investors should particularly keep an eye on the profitability and find out why ROE is negative, despite high profit margins.
