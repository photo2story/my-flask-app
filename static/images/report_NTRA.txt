**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA shows significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by a high relative divergence.  However, recent performance reveals a concerning downward trend in price and negative EPS. While revenue is growing, negative ROE across all quarters raises serious questions about the company's profitability and long-term sustainability. The high projected long-term return should be viewed with caution due to the current financial performance.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative EPS and ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility also necessitates a careful risk assessment.  A long-term investment strategy, as suggested, requires a thorough understanding of the company's fundamentals and a tolerance for significant risk.
