### 7. 종합 Analysis Summary

**Overall Assessment:**

Natera Inc. (NTRA) is a high-growth company with significant potential but also substantial risks. It has outperformed the S&P 500 historically, but recent indicators suggest caution. The company's high revenue growth and profit margins are positives. The lack of profitability, as reflected in negative EPS and ROE, is a major concern. The high volatility and potential short-term underperformance should be considered.

**Recommendation:**

A balanced approach is recommended. Given the long-term expected return, gradual accumulation may be considered, but close monitoring of earnings, news, and market conditions is essential. The Hybrid Signal suggests a prudent reduction in holdings to increase cash reserves, which seems appropriate given the mixed signals.
