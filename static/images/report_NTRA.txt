**Overall Assessment:**

NTRA presents a mixed picture. The company is experiencing strong revenue growth and has high profit margins. The market is positive, which drives up the stock price due to the current influx of investment, analyst ratings and news catalysts support a bullish outlook. However, the persistent lack of profitability (negative EPS and ROE) and the high volatility make this a risky investment.
