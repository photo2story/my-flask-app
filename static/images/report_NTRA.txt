**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30   | $0.55B   | 63.41%       |

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE      |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| 2025-06-30   | $1.25B   | -8.10%  |
| 2025-03-31   | $1.24B   | -5.40%  |

| 2024-06-30   | $0.84B   | -4.48%  |

**Analysis:** Revenue and profit margins are increasing, indicating positive growth. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) remains negative, consistent with the negative EPS, indicating the company is not generating profits relative to its equity. Although revenue is increasing and equity is growing, the company still struggles with profitability, which is a key concern.

**7) Overall Summary**

Natera (NTRA) presents a mixed picture. It has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, and analysts have a generally bullish outlook. Revenue and profit margins are growing. However, the company is not yet profitable, as evidenced by negative EPS and ROE. Recent news includes an insider selling shares and some articles questioning the stock's current price. Technical indicators suggest the stock might be approaching overbought territory.

**Recommendation:**

The investment strategy depends on risk tolerance. If you are aggressive investor and long-term horizon, this has upside potential and expect to outperform S&P 500(VOO). Consider that negative Earnings and ROE are the biggest problem with the investment decision. The insider sold the share for the specific reason, so should not have an excessive impact.
