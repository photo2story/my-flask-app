**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Natera (NTRA) is a volatile stock with a strong analyst consensus and promising revenue growth. The company is currently unprofitable, which is reflected in negative EPS and ROE. Recent news is mixed, with positive analyst upgrades and data balanced by insider selling and neutral ratings. The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. Technically, the stock is showing some short-term upward momentum, but the negative PPO and expected return suggest caution.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Natera presents a mixed picture. The increasing revenue, strong profit margins, and positive analyst sentiment are encouraging. However, the lack of profitability, high volatility, and mixed news flow suggest that investors should proceed with caution and carefully consider their risk tolerance. A small, well-researched position might be appropriate for investors seeking growth potential, but it's not a low-risk investment.
