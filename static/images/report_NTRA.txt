**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 33.84 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** -1.36 (Bearish signal)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (6 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-02)

*   **Expected Return (%):** -172.5 (Significantly negative)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI indicates a high level of investment recommendation despite recent negative signs. This could be due to future growth potential perceived by the MRI calculation or model lag.
    *   The RSI nearing oversold territory could indicate a potential for a short-term bounce.
    *   The negative PPO confirms the bearish trend.
    *   The Hybrid Signal's recommendation to buy with 100% cash, deemed "very safe", seems contradictory considering the negative expected return and other bearish signals. The MRI likely heavily influences this.
    *   The sharply negative expected return suggests that, based on current conditions and projections, Natera is expected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term if purchased at its current price.

    *   Strong revenue growth and high profit margins.
    *   Positive news flow regarding trial enrollments and test validation.
    *   Strong Buy analyst consensus with significant price target upside.
    *   The MRI indicates a high level of investment recommendation despite recent negative signs.

*   **Negatives:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   Consistently negative EPS and ROE.
    *   High historical volatility and maximum drawdowns.
    *   Negative expected return, suggesting potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
    *   Bearish technical indicators (PPO).

*   **Overall Conclusion:** Natera is a high-risk, high-reward stock. While the company shows promise in its core business with growing revenue and high profit margins, its lack of profitability and historical volatility are major concerns. The positive analyst ratings and news flow provide some support, but the negative expected return and bearish technical indicators suggest caution.

**Recommendation:**  Given the contradictory signals, a conservative approach is recommended.  If considering investment, a small position size is warranted, with careful monitoring of future earnings reports and market conditions. Further investigation into the reasons for the negative expected return is crucial.
