## Natera Inc. (NTRA) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Natera Inc. (NTRA) shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While the recent price action shows some weakness, the long-term potential, indicated by a high expected return, warrants further investigation.  Negative EPS figures require careful examination of the company's financial health.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Natera Inc. (NTRA) is a company focused on providing genetic testing and diagnostic services.

* **Cumulative Return:** NTRA: 129.11%, VOO: 79.60%
* **Return Difference:** NTRA outperformed VOO by 49.5 percentage points.  The relative outperformance compared to its historical range is at the 14.6th percentile (meaning it's relatively higher than many past periods but not exceptionally high).

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows significant volatility in performance, with periods of substantial outperformance followed by periods of significant underperformance.  The high beta values generally suggest the stock is more volatile than the overall market. Note that the high CAGR values (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in some periods are misleading without considering the severe drawdowns (MDD, Maximum Drawdown).  The negative CAGR values in recent years demonstrate considerable risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $150.93
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $153.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $146.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.51

The price is below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it's above its 20-day moving average, which indicates some potential support.  The recent price drop of $2.56 from the previous close signals a potential downward trend in the short term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 48.88 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.75 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, although the recent price decline warrants caution)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -0.4 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 105.4% (Significant potential long-term outperformance over the S&P 500, but this is conditional on favorable business conditions and a reversal of negative earnings trends.)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |

| 2024-08-09 | -$0.30 | $0.41 Billion |
| 2024-05-10 | -$0.56 | $0.37 Billion |
| 2023-11-09 | -$0.95 | $0.27 Billion |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.95 | $0.27 Billion | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*


The company is currently reporting negative EPS, indicating losses. While revenue is growing, the negative earnings trend is concerning and requires further investigation into the underlying causes.  The duplicated entry needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.48B     | 62.94%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B     | 61.79%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.41B     | 58.83%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.37B     | 56.72%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.31B     | 51.38%        |

Revenue shows a steady increase, and profit margins remain relatively high. However, this needs to be interpreted in light of the negative EPS.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE         |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.20B     | -4.50%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.88B     | -3.60%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.84B     | -4.48%      |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.79B     | -8.51%      |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.77B     | -10.20%     |

Negative ROE across all periods signals that the company is not generating returns on shareholder equity. This is a serious concern and requires further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA shows a strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this is coupled with significant volatility and periods of substantial losses.  While revenue is increasing and profit margins are relatively healthy, the persistent negative EPS and ROE are significant red flags.  The high expected return is contingent on the company reversing its current negative earnings trend and demonstrating sustainable profitability.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative EPS and the nature of the company's business model is critical before any investment decision is made.  The recent price drop indicates a possible short-term bearish trend, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain and highly dependent on the company's ability to improve its profitability.
