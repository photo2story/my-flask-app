    *   **Risks:** The unprofitability, high volatility, and the negative outcome of the IP litigation are key risks. The wide range in analyst target prices reflects the uncertainty.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the mixed outlook, a cautious approach is warranted. Consider the positive long-term growth potential in liquid biopsy, but be aware of the financial risks and competitive landscape. The "Buy" signal, in conjunction with "Caution" from the MRI, reinforces the need for careful evaluation and risk management. The recent IP loss is a serious matter that warrants careful evaluation.
