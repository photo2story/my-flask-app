* **20-Day Moving Average:** $147.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $151.79

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day averages indicates less short-term momentum.

* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.1 (Short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return:** 97.2% (A very high expected return over the long-term relative to the S&P 500. This should be treated with caution given the inherent uncertainty in future returns)
* **Price Change:** A 3.5% increase from the previous close suggests a modest upward momentum, not a rapid surge.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.26  | $0.44 B      |
| 2024-08-09 | -$0.30  | $0.41 B      |
| 2024-05-10 | -$0.56  | $0.37 B      |
| 2023-11-09 | -$0.95  | $0.27 B      |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.95  | $0.27 B      | *(Note: Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Earnings show consistent losses, though revenue is increasing.  The duplication in the last row suggests potential data errors requiring verification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.48B | 62.94%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B | 61.79%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.41B | 58.83%      |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.37B | 56.72%      |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.31B | 51.38%      |

Revenue shows steady growth, but profitability, while high, may be misleading due to losses. Profit margin and revenue growth suggest possible improvements over time.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE     |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.20B | -4.50%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.88B | -3.60%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.84B | -4.48%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.79B | -8.51%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.77B | -10.20% |

Negative ROE across all periods indicates the company is not generating a return on equity. This is a significant concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA has shown significant past outperformance against the S&P 500, but this has been highly volatile.  The company exhibits strong revenue growth but persistent net losses.  High profit margins are partially offset by negative ROE, raising concerns about long-term sustainability.  The high expected return is predicated on continuation of past outperformance, which is not guaranteed given the high volatility and negative ROE.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in the provided data, particularly the earnings and equity figures, is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high projected return should be viewed with extreme caution, considering the inherent risks associated with the company's financial performance.  Investors should carefully assess the risk tolerance before considering NTRA for investment.
