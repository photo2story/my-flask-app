**1) Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Return Rates:**
    *   NTRA Cumulative Return: 126.28%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 91.00%
    *   Divergence: 35.3 (Relative Divergence: 47.5)

The divergence of 35.3% indicates NTRA's return exceeds that of the S&P 500 by that margin.

The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are above the 60-day SMA, suggesting the upward trend may be gaining momentum, but it is still relatively recent.

    *   **Relative Divergence Change:** Indicates a recent decline in relative performance compared to the comparison index.
