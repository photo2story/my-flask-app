**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $138.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $141.58
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $145.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $159.44

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent price drop of $3.14 (from $143.2) supports this.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4337 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.70 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.22 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 138.6%  This is a remarkably high figure and requires further clarification on the calculation methodology and assumptions. It's likely an estimate based on historical outperformance, but the risk associated with such high projected returns needs to be emphasized.  It's not simply a linear extrapolation and depends on future market conditions and company performance.

The significant negative change in price (-3.14) is not a sharp drop indicating any significant 'flash crash' event. However, the overall trend seems bearish, warranting cautious optimism.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent net losses (negative EPS) and increasing revenue.  The consistency of losses needs further investigation to understand the drivers (e.g., high research and development costs, operational inefficiencies).  Further analysis is necessary to determine if the increasing revenue is outpacing the increasing losses, resulting in an improved path toward profitability.

| Date        | EPS    | Revenue      |
|-------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-12  | -0.26  | $0.44 B      |
| 2024-08-09  | -0.30  | $0.41 B      |
| 2024-05-10  | -0.56  | $0.37 B      |
| 2023-11-09  | -0.95  | $0.27 B      |

**5) Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability tables show increasing revenue quarter over quarter. However, the ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  The high profit margins despite the negative ROE need further examination to understand the accounting treatment and business model.  The negative ROE suggests there are significant challenges despite the positive revenue growth.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.48B   | 62.94%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.44B   | 61.79%        |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Natera (NTRA) has shown periods of exceptional growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this performance has been extremely volatile, with periods of substantial losses. The company's current financial situation indicates increasing revenue, but persistent losses and negative ROE raise concerns.  The high expected return figure needs further scrutiny and is likely a simplistic extrapolation based on historical data that might not reflect future market conditions.  Before any investment decision, a thorough analysis of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and risk factors is crucial.  The provided data suggests a high-risk, high-reward investment profile.  Further due diligence is recommended.
