## Natera Inc. (NTRA) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Natera Inc. (NTRA) is a genetic testing company.  While exhibiting significant outperformance against the S&P 500 (VOO) historically, recent performance shows substantial volatility and declining profitability.  Further investigation is required to determine future potential.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

NTRA's cumulative return of 129.61% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's 58.03% cumulative return.  The difference (71.6%) positions it in the 16.6th percentile of its historical relative performance range (max 629.5%, min -39.4%).

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals high volatility and inconsistent performance. While periods of extremely high CAGR are observed (e.g., 530% from 2018-2020), other periods show substantial losses (-482% from 2021-2023).  Beta values fluctuate significantly, suggesting high sensitivity to market movements. This volatility needs careful consideration. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) also shows large fluctuations reflecting the company's volatile performance.

Negative ROE consistently indicates the company is not generating returns on equity, a significant concern.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NTRA has historically shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent performance is characterized by high volatility and negative profitability, as evidenced by negative ROE.  While revenue is increasing, the persistent net losses and inconsistent alpha/beta values raise serious concerns.  The high expected return projection should be treated with extreme caution due to the inherent risk associated with the company's volatility and current financial state.  A thorough analysis of the reasons behind the negative ROE and the inconsistencies in its performance is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the company's strategy and future prospects is recommended.
