This warrants further investigation into its financial leverage and capital structure.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NTRA presents a complex picture. While its long-term growth potential is suggested by its historical outperformance of the S&P 500 and high expected return,  significant risks are evident.  The high volatility, negative ROE, and inconsistent earnings raise concerns. The companyâ€™s revenue growth is positive but profitability remains a major challenge.  Further in-depth research into the company's fundamentals, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is needed before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment strategy might be considered given the long-term outlook, but only after careful risk assessment.  The high volatility makes it a potentially high-reward, high-risk investment.
