    *   Significant outperformance vs. S&P 500 over some periods.
    *   Strong revenue growth.
    *   High profit margins.
    *   Positive analyst consensus (Strong Buy).
    *   Potential oversold condition based on RSI.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   High volatility (high MDD and fluctuating Beta).
    *   Consistent negative EPS and ROE (not yet profitable).
    *   Negative expected return compared to S&P 500 over the long term.
    *   Recent price downtrend (SMA analysis and relative divergence change).
    *   Thrivent Financial Cuts Stake.

**Conclusion:**

NTRA is a high-growth, high-risk stock. While revenue is increasing and analysts are generally positive, the company's consistent unprofitability and high volatility should be carefully considered. The recent price decline and negative expected return are cause for concern. An investment in NTRA would be considered speculative at this point, suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon. The positive analyst ratings could provide a bullish case for the company's future, however, the negative EPS, ROE and recent Relative Divergence Change paints a conflicting picture.
