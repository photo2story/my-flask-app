Note: There's a duplicate entry for 2024-04-03 and 2024-04-04.  Data inconsistency needs clarification.  A more thorough analysis requires more detailed financial statements and a clear understanding of the discrepancy in the data.  The provided data shows some fluctuation in EPS and Revenue.  More data points are needed for meaningful analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

No 'Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit' data is available. This severely limits any meaningful financial analysis.  Without this crucial information, it is impossible to assess NKE's profitability and financial health.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NKE is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, showing a substantial negative return compared to the market benchmark. Technical indicators provide a mixed signal, while the limited financial data prevents a comprehensive assessment of the company's financial health. The extremely negative expected return should be treated with caution and requires careful examination of the underlying assumptions. More detailed financial data is needed for a thorough and reliable analysis.  The inconsistent and potentially erroneous earnings data further complicates the analysis.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for NKE's underperformance is recommended before making any investment decisions.
