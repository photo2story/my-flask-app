*   **5-day Moving Average:** $83.79
*   **20-day Moving Average:** $79.99
*   **60-day Moving Average:** $81.13

The recent price action indicates a slight upward trend. The stock is currently trading above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential bullish bias. However, it is trading below its 5-day moving average, implying some short-term downward pressure.

*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.26 (Short-Term Downward Trend)

The RSI indicates that the stock is currently in overbought territory, signaling a potential short-term correction. The PPO is positive, suggesting bullish momentum. However, the Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence indicates a short-term downward trend, implying that the current upward momentum may be fading. The Expected Return of 44.73% points to potential long-term growth, but it should be considered with caution due to the potential for short-term volatility.

**4.  Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue    |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 2024-04-04 | 0.77    | $12.43 B$ |
| 2024-01-05 | 1.04    | $13.39 B$ |

| 2024-04-04 | 0.8     | $12.39 B$ |

The most recent earnings report for Q1 2024 showed an EPS of $0.77, slightly lower than the analysts' expectation of $0.79. Revenue came in at $12.43B, exceeding the estimated $12.33B. Nike's revenue growth continues to be strong, driven by strong demand for its products across its various segments. However, the company faces challenges in controlling costs and managing supply chain disruptions.

**5.  Overall Analysis:**

Nike's stock performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500, reflecting a challenging environment. The current price action shows potential for a short-term correction, supported by overbought RSI and a slightly fading upward momentum. However, positive PPO and strong revenue growth in recent earnings suggest potential long-term upside. Investors should consider the potential for near-term volatility and carefully assess their risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.
