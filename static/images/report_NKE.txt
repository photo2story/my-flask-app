**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  While technical indicators are not decisively bearish, the recent earnings results reveal a negative trend in both EPS and revenue.  The significant underperformance relative to the market, coupled with the decreasing EPS and revenue, raises concerns about the company's future prospects.  The lack of positive alpha, combined with the high beta, further suggests it's a high-risk, high-reward proposition, currently in a high-risk phase.  Further investigation into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial to forming a comprehensive investment decision. The current 0.0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests that  a long-term investment in NKE may not provide superior returns compared to a broad market index fund.
