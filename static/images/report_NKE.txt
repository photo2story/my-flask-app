## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Nike Inc. is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

The cumulative return of NKE (-2.86%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 37.39%.  The difference is a substantial -40.2%, placing it at the 9th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided relative divergence of 0.9).  The provided CAGR data shows significantly negative returns for NKE over the past few years, far underperforming the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $72.09
* **Last Market Price:** $71.26
* **5-day Moving Average:** $73.35
* **20-day Moving Average:** $76.14
* **60-day Moving Average:** $77.36

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the last market price indicates minor recent price fluctuations.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (23.63):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound, but this alone is not a buy signal.
* **PPO (-0.71):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-0.8):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (5242.2%):**  This exceptionally high expected return is likely unrealistic and requires further clarification on its calculation methodology. It is highly improbable that NKE will deliver such extraordinary returns relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  The number seems to be an error.

Given that the last market price ($71.26) is slightly lower than the closing price, there's no evidence of a significant recent sudden price movement (no sharp rebound or drop).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates but generally remains within a similar range ($11.59B to $13.39B).  There's no clear upward or downward trend discernible from this limited data.
* **EPS:** EPS shows volatility, with a significant drop from $1.04 in Q1 2024 to $0.70 in Q2 2024.  It partially recovered to $0.77 and $0.78 in subsequent quarters. The repetition of the 2025-01-03 data is likely a duplicate.

The data lacks context regarding earnings expectations, preventing an assessment of "beats" or "misses."

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, with minor fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high (43.62% to 45.36%), indicating strong profitability.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable. Return on Equity (ROE) shows some fluctuation, but generally remains above 7%, suggesting reasonable profitability relative to invested capital.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news releases (within the past two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to complete the analysis.  No such information was provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike (NKE) is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, but the negative PPO and downward moving averages indicate a bearish trend.  Recent earnings data shows some volatility in EPS, but revenue remains relatively stable and profit margins are high.  However, the significant negative CAGR figures provided raise serious concerns about the long-term prospects of the stock. The extraordinarily high projected return should be disregarded without further clarification on its source and methodology. More information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions is needed for a comprehensive assessment.  The provided data alone does not give a clear buy or sell recommendation.  Further investigation is warranted before making any investment decisions.
