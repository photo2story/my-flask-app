## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Nike Inc. is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

As of the last data point, NKE's cumulative return is -2.87%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 112.47%.  This represents a significant underperformance of -115.3% compared to the benchmark.  The relative divergence of -115.3 falls within the historical range (max: 73.9, min: -120.6), indicating it's not entirely unprecedented but still exceptionally low.

The provided alpha (0.1 consistently) suggests NKE's returns are slightly above what would be expected given its beta (ranging from 85.0 to 107.0), indicating some degree of outperformance in certain periods despite overall underperformance in recent years.  However, the sharply declining CAGR figures over the past few years are very concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $72.08
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $75.21
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $76.86

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 23.18 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible.
* **PPO:** -0.62 – A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +2.2 – This suggests a short-term upward trend, but it is weak given the overall context.
* **Expected Return:** -372.2% – This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) horizon strongly suggests significant risk and potential for continued underperformance.  The current price of $72.08 is not reflecting a significant bounce back based on this projection.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  While there are some periods of higher EPS (e.g., $1.04 in Q1 2024 and Q1 2025), the most recent quarters show a decline in EPS, potentially contributing to the stock's underperformance.  Revenue also shows some variability but does not show a clear downward trend.  The lack of consistency in earnings warrants further investigation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NKE is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500, with a dramatically negative expected return compared to the benchmark. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions and a potential short-term bounce, the negative PPO, declining CAGR, and extremely low expected return paint a concerning picture. The recent earnings data shows some variability but no clear upward trend. While profit margins and revenue remain relatively high and stable, the declining EPS, and lower ROE in the most recent quarters are a serious concern.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for this underperformance is crucial before considering any investment.  The current price, while technically oversold, appears to reflect accurately the substantial risk associated with the stock in the near term.  Any investment should be approached with extreme caution.
