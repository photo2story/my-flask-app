## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Nike Inc. (NKE) is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

The provided data shows NKE significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The cumulative return for NKE is -4.38%, while VOO's is 116.43%. This results in a large divergence of -120.8%. The relative divergence of 0.1 indicates that this underperformance is at the very low end of the historical range of relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  The CAGR of -4.0% over 2015-2025 further highlights this underperformance.  A beta of 105 suggests significantly higher volatility than the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $70.96
* **Last Market Price:** $70.97
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.30
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $74.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $76.26

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 21.17 (Significantly below 30, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.44 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -1091.1% (This extremely negative value likely represents a significant underperformance expectation relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon, possibly due to an error in the calculation or data input.  Further investigation is needed.)

The market price of $70.97 is not significantly different from the closing price. It doesn't indicate a sharp rebound or decline.  The extremely negative expected return warrants further scrutiny of the methodology used to arrive at that figure.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistency.  There are two entries for 2025-01-03 with identical values, suggesting potential data duplication or error.  While revenue generally fluctuates, EPS shows a downward trend from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024, recovering to the level of Q1 2024 by the end of 2025 (assuming the duplicate entry is an error). A more detailed analysis of these figures is needed to draw definitive conclusions about performance trends.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue      |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2025-01-03 | 0.78 | $12.35B      |
| 2024-10-07 | 0.7  | $11.59B      |
| 2024-04-04 | 0.77 | $12.43B      |
| 2024-01-05 | 1.04 | $13.39B      |
| **2025-01-03** | **1.04** | **$13.39B** | *(Likely Duplicate)*


**5. Financial Information:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity     | ROE      |
|-------------|------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| 2024-11-30  | $12.35B    | 43.62%         | $14.04B    | 8.29%    |
| 2024-08-31  | $11.59B    | 45.36%         | $13.94B    | 7.54%    |
| 2024-05-31  | $12.61B    | 44.69%         | $14.43B    | 10.40%   |
| 2024-02-29  | $12.43B    | 44.75%         | $14.23B    | 8.24%    |
| 2023-11-30  | $13.39B    | 44.60%         | $14.15B    | 11.16%   |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NKE's stock performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500.  While the company maintains consistent profitability margins, recent earnings show some volatility.  Technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest oversold conditions, potentially indicating a bounce, but the extremely negative projected long-term return needs further review. The extremely high beta of 105 suggests exceptionally high volatility.  The data provided contains some inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) requiring clarification.  A thorough fundamental analysis, considering macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape, is necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of NKE's future prospects.  The extremely low and negative expected returns provided should be independently verified.
