## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Nike Inc. is a multinational corporation engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and worldwide marketing and sales of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.  This report analyzes Nike's recent performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering key financial metrics, technical indicators, and recent earnings.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Nike's cumulative return (3.05%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (118.31%) over the analyzed period.  The lag is -115.3%, placing it at the 5.4th percentile of its historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-126.0% to 73.9%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market.  While periods of high CAGR (e.g., 2017-2019, 2018-2020) show positive alpha (outperformance), recent years exhibit negative CAGRs and significantly higher Beta (market sensitivity). This suggests increased volatility and underperformance relative to the broader market in recent times. Notably,  the high Beta values in the later years indicates that NKE's price movements are highly correlated with the overall market.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2025-01-03 | $0.78 | $12.35B        |
| 2024-10-07 | $0.70 | $11.59B        |

| 2025-01-03 | $1.04 | $13.39B        |

There is some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  A noticeable dip in EPS and revenue occurred in Q4 2024, followed by a slight increase in Q1 2025.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes of these fluctuations.  The repetition of the same figures for January 3rd, 2025 requires clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

| 2023-11-30  | $14.15B    | 11.16%  |

Equity and ROE show some variability.  ROE, a key indicator of profitability, shows a fluctuation, with a peak in Q2 2024, but remaining consistently above 7%

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance is concerning. While it has historically shown periods of strong growth and outperformance, recent data reveals significant underperformance against the S&P 500, highlighted by a very negative projected long-term return. High beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  While some technical indicators suggest potential short-term upward momentum,  the negative long-term expected return coupled with recent earnings volatility casts doubt on its long-term prospects.  Further investigation is needed into the factors driving the recent underperformance to determine whether the current valuation reflects this risk and any potential future growth opportunities.  The duplicated data point for January 3rd, 2025 needs to be resolved.  A deeper dive into the qualitative factors, such as competitive landscape, and macroeconomic conditions affecting the apparel industry is necessary for a more complete assessment.
