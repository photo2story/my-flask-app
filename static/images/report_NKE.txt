**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue |
|------------|------|---------|
| 2024-04-04 | 0.77 | 12.43 B$ |
| 2024-01-05 | 1.04 | 13.39 B$ |
| 2023-10-06 | 0.95 | 12.94 B$ |
| 2023-04-06 | 0.8  | 12.39 B$ |
| 2024-04-04 | 0.8  | 12.39 B$ |

The most recent earnings report (2024-04-04) showed EPS of $0.77, slightly exceeding analyst estimates. Revenue also slightly missed expectations. Despite the recent earnings beat, Nike faces several headwinds, including a challenging macroeconomic environment, high inflation, and declining consumer confidence. 

**5. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's current performance is lagging behind the market, with a significant negative relative divergence. The stock is in oversold territory based on the RSI, but the PPO suggests continued negative momentum. While the recent earnings beat was positive, the challenging macro environment and consumer confidence issues present a significant challenge. The expected return of 44.61% could be enticing for long-term investors, but it's important to consider the risks associated with the current market conditions and Nike's performance.

**6. Conclusion:**

Nike is facing a challenging period, with a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While the oversold condition and positive relative divergence could suggest a potential rebound, the negative PPO and challenging macro environment make a clear bullish outlook uncertain. Investors should carefully consider these factors and assess their individual risk tolerance before investing in Nike.
