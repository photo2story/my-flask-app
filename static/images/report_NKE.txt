2026-01-04 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive report analyzing Nike (NKE) based on the data provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (NKE vs. VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Nike Inc. designs, develops, markets, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories worldwide.
*   **NKE Cumulative Return:** -26.57%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 91.00%
*   **Divergence:** -117.7 (Relative Divergence: 5.7)

**Analysis:** Nike has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The divergence is substantial, indicating a large gap in returns. The relative divergence of 5.7 suggests that the current divergence is near the lowest end of its historical range, which means that the divergence between the stock and its comparison is very large compared to the past.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|------|--------|
| 2016-2018  | 11.0% | 19.2% | 7.0%  | 1.0  | 109.6  |
| 2017-2019  | 46.0% | 19.2% | 29.0% | 1.1  | 149.8  |
| 2018-2020  | 41.0% | 19.2% | 20.0% | 1.0  | 209.1  |
| 2019-2021  | 55.0% | 17.4% | 12.0% | 1.0  | 246.4  |
| 2020-2022  | -12.0% | 43.4% | -10.0% | 1.1  | 173.0  |
| 2021-2023  | -27.0% | 43.4% | -28.0% | 1.2  | 160.5  |
| 2022-2024  | -67.0% | 37.8% | -87.0% | 1.2  | 111.9  |
| 2023-2025  | -55.0% | 44.0% | -117.0% | 1.0  | 94.2   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compounded Annual Growth Rate demonstrates strong performance in earlier periods (2017-2021), but shows significant negative growth in recent years (2020-2025).
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown indicates the biggest peak-to-trough decline during the period. MDD has been relatively high, especially in recent periods, reflecting significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha represents the excess return compared to the benchmark. It's been negative and declining sharply in recent years, suggesting Nike is underperforming its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta, generally around 1, indicates Nike's volatility is similar to the market.  The slight increase to 1.2 in some periods suggests slightly higher volatility than the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap has decreased significantly in recent years, which makes sense based on recent poor market performance of NKE.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 63.28
*   **Previous Close:** 63.71
*   **Change:** -0.67
*   **5-day SMA:** 62.06
*   **20-day SMA:** 63.46
*   **60-day SMA:** 64.57

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly down from its previous close. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term downward trend. The 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA, hinting at a potential ongoing downtrend.

**3) Market Risk Indicators and Signals**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 37.68
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.07
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (15 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)"
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 5.7 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -593.2

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A reading of 0.8 suggests medium investment risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 37.68 indicates the stock is nearing oversold conditions, suggesting potential for a rebound.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.07 does not provide much information on its own, but generally it shows a very slight upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The system recommends buying 90% of available cash, indicating a buy signal, though the MRI suggests only a medium level of safety. The recent divergence change indicates a short-term increase.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a very concerning signal.

**Analysis:**  The news is mixed. Some articles question if Nike is a buy after a significant decline, while others highlight insider buying (CEO, Tim Cook) which could be a positive signal.

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating on Nike. The average target price of $77.24 suggests potential upside from the current price, but the low target of $35.00 indicates significant disagreement among analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출      |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-10-01 | 0.49 | 11.72 B$ |
| 2025-04-03 | 0.54 | 11.27 B$ |
| 2025-01-03 | 0.78 | 12.35 B$ |
| 2024-10-07 | 0.7  | 11.59 B$ |
| 2025-10-01 | 0.7  | 11.59 B$ |

**Analysis:** The earnings per share (EPS) has fluctuated and generally trended downwards in the most recent quarters. Revenue has also shown some volatility, but has been above 11B$. The recent trend in EPS is a concern.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-11-30 | $12.43B   | 40.60%        |
| 2025-08-31 | $11.72B   | 42.18%        |
| 2025-05-31 | $11.10B   | 40.27%        |
| 2025-02-28 | $11.27B   | 41.49%        |
| 2024-11-30 | $12.35B   | 43.62%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE   |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| 2025-11-30 | $14.09B   | 5.62% |
| 2025-08-31 | $13.47B   | 5.40% |
| 2025-05-31 | $13.21B   | 1.60% |
| 2025-02-28 | $14.01B   | 5.67% |
| 2024-11-30 | $14.04B   | 8.29% |

**Analysis:**  While revenue remains strong, the profit margin has decreased from 43.62% to 40.60% in recent quarters. Equity has remained relatively stable, but ROE (Return on Equity) has fluctuated significantly and has decreased from 8.29% to 5.62% in recent quarters. The decrease in ROE is concerning, and indicates that NKE is not making the same amount of profit from equity than it used to.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Nike has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. Recent stock performance shows a short-term downward trend.  While the MRI suggests medium investment risk and the hybrid signal is a buy, the extremely negative expected return and recent negative Alpha make the stock concerning for long term investment. While the analyst consensus is to "Buy," the wide range in target prices highlights uncertainty. Recent earnings data shows declining EPS and decreasing ROE, which are concerning. However, the insider buying by the CEO and Tim Cook could be a positive signal, suggesting they believe the stock is undervalued.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The data presents a mixed picture for Nike. While there are some potentially positive signals (insider buying, oversold RSI), the negative trends in returns, earnings, and profitability, coupled with the extremely negative expected return, warrant caution. More in-depth research is required to assess the reasons behind the underperformance and to determine if a turnaround is likely.
