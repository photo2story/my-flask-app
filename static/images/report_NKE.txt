Key concerns include  a considerable negative Alpha in recent years and high volatility indicated by both MDD and significant price movement.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

Nike Inc. is a leading designer, developer, and marketer of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories.

* **Cumulative Return:** NKE: 7.79%, VOO: 112.87%

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 17.0% | 7.7% | -11.0% | 0.0 | 85.5 |
| 2016-2018  | 14.0% | 10.1% | 0.1 | 102.5 |
| 2017-2019  | 70.0% | 10.7% | 0.6 | 141.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 94.0% | 10.7% | 0.4 | 199.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 98.0% | 11.3% | 0.4 | 236.7 |
| 2020-2022  | 4.0% | 21.1% | 0.4 | 168.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -60.0% | 21.1% | 1.4 | 157.9 |
| 2022-2024  | -110.0% | 21.1% | 1.1 | 111.9 |
| 2023-2025  | -68.0% | 19.9% | -0.5 | 118.4 |

The table reveals significant volatility in CAGR and concerning negative Alpha values in recent years (-11.0% in 2015-2017 and -0.5 in 2023-2025), indicating underperformance relative to the market.  The relatively low and even negative Beta suggests less sensitivity to market movements in recent periods but does not explain the significant negative Alpha.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $80.02
* **Previous Close:** $81.17
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $79.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $75.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.52

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average but significantly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent price increase after a period of lower prices. The significant daily price drop (-1.42) should be considered.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 69.51 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.09 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +6.5% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -125.7% (Significant negative expected return relative to S&P 500)

The RSI nearing overbought levels and the relatively high negative expected return raise concerns about potential short-term corrections despite the positive PPO.  The large negative change in price from the previous close (-$1.15) indicates a significant daily drop, suggesting a potential short-term bearish sentiment.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2025-01-03 | $0.78 | $12.35 B       |

| 2025-01-03 | $1.04 | $13.39 B       |

Earnings show some volatility, with EPS fluctuating.  Revenue also shows some fluctuation.  The duplicated entry for 2025-01-03 needs clarification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NKE's substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500, coupled with a negative Alpha in several recent periods,  indicates a serious concern. The recent price drop and nearing overbought RSI suggest potential for short-term correction.  While the financial statements reveal relatively stable revenue and profit margins, the negative expected return and volatility raise questions about the long-term investment outlook.  Further analysis is needed to identify the underlying causes of the underperformance, address the duplicated earnings data, and clarify the substantial negative expected return.  A deeper dive into macroeconomic factors affecting the athletic apparel industry, Nike's competitive landscape, and its long-term growth strategy is crucial before making any investment decisions.
