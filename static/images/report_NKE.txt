## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**

Nike, Inc. is a multinational corporation engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and worldwide marketing and sales of footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Nike's cumulative return (-9.74%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (76.31%).  The difference is a substantial -86.0%, placing it at the 12.9th percentile of its historical range (-105.4% to 45.2%). This indicates Nike's performance has been considerably weaker than the broader market over the analyzed period.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows a mixed performance.  While showing periods of strong outperformance (high Alpha values from 2017-2021),  recent years (2021-2025) exhibit dramatically negative CAGR and high Beta, suggesting significant market sensitivity and underperformance compared to the market.  The large negative CAGR in recent years outweighs the earlier positive periods.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 20.0% | 58.9% | -13.0% | 0.0 | 84.3 |
| 2016-2018  | 3.0% | 12.6% | -18.0% | -0.0 | 101.1 |
| 2017-2019  | 60.0% | 12.6% | 27.0% | 0.6 | 139.6 |
| 2018-2020  | 71.0% | 59.7% | 41.0% | 1.0 | 196.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 79.0% | 59.7% | 19.0% | 1.1 | 233.5 |
| 2020-2022  | 1.0% | 73.8% | -8.0% | 1.2 | 165.7 |
| 2021-2023  | -36.0% | 73.8% | -57.0% | 1.3 | 155.8 |
| 2022-2024  | -80.0% | 73.8% | -100.0% | 1.6 | 110.4 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $57.06
* **5-day moving average:** $55.46
* **20-day moving average:** $58.86
* **60-day moving average:** $69.58

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase of $1.67 (Last-market data) shows a minor positive movement, but it's not sufficient to overcome the overall bearish trend indicated by the moving averages.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.19 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.4321 (Positive, but needs context of historical values)
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** +2.1 (Short-term upward trend)

The indicators present a mixed signal. While RSI is nearing oversold levels, suggesting potential for a bounce, the overall trend remains negative according to the moving averages and the significant negative expected return.  The recent price increase of $1.67 is modest and doesn't significantly alter the overall bearish picture.  The -167.3% expected return is extremely negative and needs further clarification on the calculation method and underlying assumptions.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-04-03 | $0.54  | $11.27B       |
| 2025-01-03 | $0.78  | $12.35B       |
| 2024-10-07 | $0.70  | $11.59B       |
| 2024-04-04 | $0.77  | $12.43B       |
| 2025-04-03 | $0.77  | $12.43B       |

Note: There's a duplicate entry for 2025-04-03.  Assuming this is an error, we see fluctuating EPS and Revenue.  A more detailed analysis requires comparing these figures to previous years and industry benchmarks to determine if the performance is good or bad.  Further context is needed to assess whether the fluctuations are normal or indicative of underlying issues.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-02-28 | $11.27B   | 41.49%        |
| 2024-11-30 | $12.35B   | 43.62%        |
| 2024-08-31 | $11.59B   | 45.36%        |
| 2024-05-31 | $12.61B   | 44.69%        |
| 2024-02-29 | $12.43B   | 44.75%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE     |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2025-02-28 | $14.01B   | 5.67%   |
| 2024-11-30 | $14.04B   | 8.29%   |
| 2024-08-31 | $13.94B   | 7.54%   |
| 2024-05-31 | $14.43B   | 10.40%  |
| 2024-02-29 | $14.23B   | 8.24%   |

Both revenue and profitability show some fluctuation but generally remain strong.  ROE also fluctuates, indicating potential volatility in profitability.  More analysis is needed comparing these numbers against industry peers and past performance to assess if they are healthy or concerning.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  While past periods show periods of strong outperformance, recent years have been marked by substantial underperformance.  Technical indicators present a mixed signal, with RSI nearing oversold territory but moving averages suggesting a downtrend.  Earnings data shows some volatility, but further analysis is needed to assess its significance.  The extremely negative expected return (-167.3%) warrants further investigation into its calculation.  Overall, the current outlook for NKE appears bearish, though the potential for a short-term bounce based on RSI cannot be entirely discounted.  A longer-term perspective and a more in-depth fundamental analysis are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided -167.3% expected return requires a thorough explanation of the methodology used, as it's highly improbable and indicative of a flaw in the calculation or possibly a misunderstanding of the metric itself.
