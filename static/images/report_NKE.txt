**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended).  *Note: While the MRI suggests medium investment, the other indicators paint a more concerning picture.*
*   **RSI:** 32.80. *This is near oversold territory (below 30), which *could* indicate a potential for a bounce, but in a downtrend, it can stay oversold for an extended period.*
*   **PPO:** -0.48. *The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being negative suggests a downtrend, but is not significantly low, suggesting a need to continue to monitor.*
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (25 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_0.41 Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01) *This signal seems to contradict the other indicators and should be viewed with caution.*
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 3.7 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase). *This contrasts with the overall negative trend and recent price drop, suggesting this could be a short-lived bounce within a larger downtrend.*
*   **Expected Return:** -565.3%. *This extremely negative expected return is very concerning and suggests significant risks for long-term investors at the current price.*

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Nike Stock Tumbles After Earnings Beat:** *This headline highlights a key issue.  The company beat earnings expectations, but the stock still declined.  This suggests underlying concerns beyond the immediate financials. Analysts are still saying to buy despite the tumble.*
*   **Other Headlines:** The other headlines focus on general market trends, tech stock performance, and movers, but the Nike specific headline is the most relevant.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (1.95)
*   **Average Target Price:** $78.63

*   **Analysis:** While the consensus is "Buy" and the target price is significantly higher than the current price, the recent negative price action *despite* an earnings beat suggests analysts might be slow to revise their ratings downward.  Pay close attention to future rating changes.
