Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Nike (NKE) based on the data provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Nike Inc. is a global sportswear and equipment company.

*   **Return Comparison:**
    *   NKE Cumulative Return: -23.92%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 94.64%

*   **Analysis:** Nike has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The large negative divergence (-118.6) highlights this underperformance. The relative divergence of 5.6 indicates that the current divergence is near the minimum of its historical range, suggesting it *could* be near a bottom. However, it also means the underperformance is significant compared to the market.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 18.0%   | 69.2%  | -10.0%  | -0.0   | 92.5   |
| 2016-2018  | 0.0%    | 10.7%  | -16.0%  | -0.1   | 109.6  |
| 2017-2019  | 49.0%   | 69.4%  | 27.0%   | 0.4    | 149.8  |
| 2018-2020  | 45.0%   | 81.7%  | 22.0%   | 0.3    | 209.1  |
| 2019-2021  | 60.0%   | 81.7%  | 13.0%   | 0.8    | 246.4  |
| 2020-2022  | -11.0%  | 81.7%  | -10.0%  | 1.8    | 173.0  |
| 2021-2023  | -27.0%  | 80.7%  | -29.0%  | 2.5    | 160.5  |
| 2022-2024  | -71.0%  | 80.7%  | -91.0%  | 2.4    | 111.9  |
| 2023-2025  | -58.0%  | 83.6%  | -118.0% | -0.7   | 92.8   |

    *   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows periods of strong growth followed by significant declines in recent years.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial volatility and risk.
    *   **Alpha:** The Alpha is consistently negative, especially in recent periods, meaning Nike has underperformed its benchmark (presumably the S&P 500) after accounting for risk.  The significantly negative Alphas in recent years are concerning.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta fluctuates and is negative in some periods, but trending upwards and is high in recent years (above 1), indicates the stock is more volatile than the market. A beta of -0.7 in 2023-2025 indicates a negative correlation.
    *   **Capitalization (Cap):**  The company's market capitalization (in billions) shows an increase followed by a decline, aligning with the growth and subsequent downturn in performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close Price: 62.80
*   Last Market: Price Change: +2.23 (previous close 61.43)
*   5-day SMA: 62.45
*   20-day SMA: 63.52
*   60-day SMA: 68.77

*   **Analysis:** The stock is currently trading *below* its 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). The recent price increase suggests a short-term upward trend, but the longer-term SMAs suggest that the stock still needs to recover to demonstrate a consistent positive trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Market Risk Indicators**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 50.56
*   PPO: 0.2174
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = 1.4 (+): 단기상승
*   Expected Return (%): -583.8%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:**  The Medium Investment recommendation suggests a moderate level of risk and potential reward based on the model.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 50.56 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.2174 suggests a slight upward momentum, but is not significant.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** "Buy 100% of cash" suggests the model sees an opportunity to buy based on current conditions. The Very Safe classification and MRI of 0.90 further reinforce the recommendation.
    *   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:**  The positive change of 1.4 indicates a short-term upward trend relative to the comparison stock (S&P 500).
    *   **Expected Return:** A very negative expected return of -583.8% is extremely concerning. This figure strongly suggests that the model forecasts a very poor long-term return for the stock if purchased at the current price.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Motley Fool - Lululemon Stock:**  This suggests investors are comparing Nike to its competitors and could be a factor in investment decisions.
*   **Benzinga - On Running Shoes:** Competition in the running shoe market. This shows the competitive landscape Nike operates within.
*   **StockStory - Sphere Entertainment, Red Rock Resorts, and Nike Stocks Trade Up:** Positive movement, but lacks details on Nike-specific reasons.
*   **MT Newswires - Consumer Stocks:**  Indicates broader market trends in the consumer sector, which can impact Nike's performance.

*   **Analysis:** The news headlines paint a mixed picture. While there are some positive movements, the focus on competitors and general sector trends suggests that Nike faces specific challenges.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.98)
*   **Opinions:** 35
*   **Target Price:** 83.30 (Avg) / 120.00 (High) / 38.00 (Low)

*   **Analysis:**  Analysts generally have a "Buy" rating with a consensus target price significantly above the current price. This indicates that analysts believe the stock is undervalued. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices (38 to 120) suggests considerable uncertainty among analysts regarding the company's future performance.
