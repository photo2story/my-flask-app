NKE has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined, exhibiting high volatility and inconsistent profitability. While some short-term indicators suggest potential upward momentum (RSI in neutral range, slight positive PPO, positive 20-day relative divergence), the long-term outlook is clouded by consistently low alpha, historically poor relative performance and recent earnings which suggest revenue and profit decline. The provided data lacks critical information, such as analyst expectations and recent news, making a comprehensive assessment difficult.  The extremely low beta value also demands further investigation.  The provided data suggests a need for more in-depth analysis before considering investment.
