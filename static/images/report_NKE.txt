**0. Executive Summary:**

Nike Inc. (NKE), a leading global sportswear company, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period. While showing periods of strong growth, recent performance has been weak, resulting in substantial negative returns.  This report analyzes NKE's recent performance, incorporating financial data, technical indicators, and comparative benchmarks to assess its current state and potential future trajectory.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Nike Inc. (NKE) is a multinational corporation designing, developing, and marketing footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

* **Cumulative Return (NKE):** -10.07%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 76.18%
* **Return Difference:** -86.3% (NKE underperformed VOO by 86.3 percentage points).
* **Relative Divergence:** 12.7% (This places NKE's underperformance in the lower 12.7% of its historical range against the S&P 500.)

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (S&P 500). While exhibiting periods of high CAGR and strong alpha, recent years have shown dramatically negative returns and a consistently increasing beta, suggesting heightened market sensitivity.  The large market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects Nike's significant size in the industry, yet recent negative CAGRs are concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $55.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $54.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $59.96
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $70.15

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price increase of 4.13% (from $53.55) represents a notable short-term upward swing, potentially indicating a temporary rebound.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.51 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.34 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +1.5 (Suggests short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -168.8% (This extremely negative figure requires further clarification; it likely reflects a highly pessimistic scenario and needs a more detailed explanation for its derivation).  Further investigation into the methodology used to determine this expected return is crucial.

The 4.13% price increase reflects a potential short-term bounce, but overall indicators suggest bearish sentiment. The extremely low expected return raises serious concerns about the long-term outlook.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been weak, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. While possessing high profit margins and a substantial market capitalization, inconsistent revenue growth and recent declines in earnings raise concerns.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, although the recent price increase may signal a temporary rebound. The extremely negative expected return requires further investigation and clarification.  Before making any investment decision, a more thorough examination of the underlying data, specifically addressing inconsistencies and clarifying the methodology behind the expected return calculation, is strongly recommended.  Data quality issues, like the duplicate entry in the earnings data, need to be resolved for a more reliable analysis.
