## Nike Inc (NKE) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Nike Inc. (NKE), a global sportswear and apparel company, significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.  The cumulative return difference between NKE and VOO is a substantial -117.8 percentage points. While the provided data shows periods of strong performance for NKE, the most recent years have displayed considerable losses, resulting in this significant underperformance compared to the broader market index.  The relative divergence metric (-117.8 out of a range from -118.4 to 74.0, placing it at the 0.3 percentile) further emphasizes this underperformance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a consistently low alpha (around 0.1), suggesting NKE has not significantly outperformed the market considering its beta. While Beta fluctuates, it generally indicates a high correlation with the overall market.  The significant negative CAGR values in the most recent years (-60%, -108%) are highly concerning.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $77.20
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $77.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $77.23
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $79.50

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend.  The relatively close proximity of the 5 and 20-day moving averages to the closing price might indicate consolidation or a potential short-term bounce. However, the significant distance below the 60-day MA signals a longer-term downward pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (42.23):** Suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory but not definitively so.  Further decline might be possible.
* **PPO (0.056):**  A slightly positive PPO indicates a potential bullish momentum but it is a very weak signal.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-0.7):** Shows a recent negative trend in relative strength, implying NKE is underperforming compared to the broader market.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  A 0% expected return indicates no expectation of outperformance versus the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is consistent with the historical performance data.  Considering the current state, a more conservative outlook would be warranted.  A significant negative return would not be surprising. The $77.20 price is not notably high or low to trigger an interpretation of a sudden market movement.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The most recent quarterly earnings data shows a declining trend in both EPS and Revenue.

* **Revenue:** Revenue peaked in Q1 2024 ($13.39B) and has shown a consistent downward trend since then.
* **EPS:**  EPS also peaked in Q1 2024 ($1.04) and has declined in each subsequent quarter.  This represents a concerning trend.  There is no evidence of “beats” or “misses” against any assumed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue has shown significant fluctuation, suggesting some volatility in sales. Profit margins are relatively stable but show a slight downward trend overall.
* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity is generally stable, but ROE shows some fluctuations.  High ROE values were recorded in the past, but this has declined in the last few quarters.

The overall financial picture shows a decline in revenue, EPS, and ROE, raising serious concerns.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been significantly disappointing relative to the S&P 500.  The downward trends in revenue, EPS, and ROE, coupled with the negative price action and low technical indicators, suggest a bearish outlook.  While the company has historically demonstrated periods of strong growth, the current financial picture and market performance raise significant concerns.  A long-term investment in NKE at this time, without a substantial improvement in fundamental performance, would carry considerable risk based solely on the provided data.  Further research into current market conditions and recent news related to Nike is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
