| 2023-2025  | -56.0%  | 83.6%  | -123.0% | -0.7    | 95.5   |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows a steep decline, ending in significantly negative territory for the most recent periods. This indicates poor performance over the last few years.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown remains consistently high, suggesting significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative, especially in recent years.  This means Nike is underperforming relative to its expected return based on its risk (Beta). In the last reporting period, Alpha of -123% is very concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates and more recently indicates that the stock's volatility (price movement) is higher than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has decreased from 246.4 Billion to 95.5 Billion over the period.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   5-day SMA: 63.474
*   20-day SMA: 62.9937
*   60-day SMA: 67.8138

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly up from the previous close. The 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) are below the current price, indicating a potential short-term upward trend. However, the 60-day SMA is significantly higher, suggesting that the overall longer-term trend may still be downward.

*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = 1.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   Expected Return (%): -583.8

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a *high* investment recommendation, which seems counterintuitive given the negative returns and other indicators.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 61.52 is nearing overbought territory (typically above 70), but not yet there.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, suggesting a potential upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests buying with 100% cash, considering it a very safe investment based on the MRI.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term improvement compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-583.8%) is very concerning.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

Nike's recent performance is concerning. The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a consistent underperformance relative to the market, and a significantly negative Alpha in the most recent period. Recent news and events highlight concerns about the brand, analyst downgrades, and technical indicators suggesting a downward trend. While analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy" rating, the wide range of target prices reflects uncertainty. Earnings and financial data show declining revenue, profit margins, and ROE, further adding to the concerns. Even though the Market Risk Indicator is high, recommending investment, the expected return is extremely negative.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, investing in Nike at this time would be considered risky. While there may be potential for a short-term rebound based on the recent divergence change and technical indicators, the underlying financials and negative sentiment surrounding the stock raise significant concerns. The large negative expected return should be a major red flag for investors. More investigation is required to consider the validity of the MRI signal.
