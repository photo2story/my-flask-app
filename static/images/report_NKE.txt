* **PPO:** 0.31 – Positive, indicating upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.4 – Short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – The provided data does not offer a basis for projecting a long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500.  A 0% expected return implies that, based solely on the given information, there's no expectation of outperformance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a general decline in both EPS and revenue over the past four quarters.

* **Revenue:**  Revenue peaked at $13.39B in Q1 2024 and has generally decreased since then, reaching $11.59B in the most recent quarter (Q4 2024).
* **EPS:** Similarly, EPS was highest at $1.04 in Q1 2024 and subsequently declined to $0.70 in Q4 2024.  There's no information provided about whether these figures met or missed expectations.  The repetition of the Oct 7th, 2024 data point is likely an error.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Both revenue and profitability metrics show a downward trend in recent quarters. Revenue decreased from $13.39B in Q1 2024 to $11.59B in Q4 2024.  Profit margins remain relatively stable, hovering around 44-45%.  Equity has generally decreased over the period, and ROE fluctuates but doesn't show a clear trend.  The data provided does not give a full picture of the financial health; a comprehensive review would require more data points and context.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or market outlook information is provided.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are missing.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NKE has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period. While some short-term indicators (PPO, 20-day divergence) suggest upward momentum, the declining revenue and EPS trends raise concerns. Technical indicators show the stock is approaching overbought territory.  The lack of information regarding recent news, analyst opinions, and expected earnings makes it difficult to form a complete picture.  More information is needed to accurately assess the stock's prospects. The 0% expected return reflects the lack of positive signals from the limited information provided.
