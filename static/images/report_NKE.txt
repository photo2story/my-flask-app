| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

The current closing price of $57.25 is significantly below all three moving averages (5-day: $61.21, 20-day: $68.15, 60-day: $72.59), suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase of $3.0 reflects a potentially significant upward swing.

**3. Technical Indicators and Divergence:**

The RSI of 14.62 indicates oversold conditions, potentially suggesting a bounce. However, the negative PPO (-1.82) points to bearish momentum. The recent increase in relative strength (+9.7) suggests a short-term upward trend. The MRI of 0.4693 classifies the market risk as high.  The large price change ({'price': 57.25, 'previousClose': 55.58, 'change': 3.0}) suggests a notable price jump that needs further investigation.  The -109% expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term highlights significant risks.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike (NKE) has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While some technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce (oversold RSI), the overall picture remains bearish, underscored by a negative PPO, high market risk indicator, and consistently high beta. The recent earnings data shows some volatility but does not indicate a clear trend.  A long-term investment in NKE carries significant risk given the projections.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent poor performance and future growth prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions. The -109% expected return compared to the S&P 500 significantly highlights the considerable risk involved in a long-term investment.  Careful consideration of the risks is essential.
