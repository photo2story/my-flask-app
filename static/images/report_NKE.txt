**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $76.90
* **Previous Close:** $78.33
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $76.36
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.63

The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend, but above the 20-day moving average, indicating some support. The recent price change shows a drop of approximately 1.83%, reflecting potential market volatility and the need for close monitoring.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 69.08 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.02 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength:** 3.4 (+) indicating short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -349.4%  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern.  It suggests a high risk of substantial underperformance over the long term.

The significant negative price change (-1.83%) from the previous close warrants close attention. While the PPO is positive, the RSI is approaching overbought territory, suggesting caution against further price increases in the short term. The dramatically negative expected return, however, presents the most alarming factor.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2025-01-03 | $0.78  | $12.35B        |
| 2024-10-07 | $0.70  | $11.59B        |
| 2024-04-04 | $0.77  | $12.43B        |
| 2024-01-05 | $1.04  | $13.39B        |
| 2025-01-03 | $1.04  | $13.39B        |

Earnings show some volatility.  There's a noticeable drop in EPS and revenue in Q4 2024 compared to Q1 2024, followed by a slight increase in revenue in Q1 2025, although EPS remain relatively flat.  Further analysis is needed to understand the factors driving this fluctuation, but this could be a reason for the stock underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Note the duplicated entry for 2025-01-03; this should be clarified.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-11-30 | $12.35B      | 43.62%        |
| 2024-08-31 | $11.59B      | 45.36%        |
| 2024-05-31 | $12.61B      | 44.69%        |
| 2024-02-29 | $12.43B      | 44.75%        |
| 2023-11-30 | $13.39B      | 44.60%        |

Revenue shows a slight downward trend in recent quarters, alongside a mostly stable, slightly fluctuating profit margin.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity       | ROE           |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-11-30 | $14.04B      | 8.29%         |
| 2024-08-31 | $13.94B      | 7.54%         |
| 2024-05-31 | $14.43B      | 10.40%        |
| 2024-02-29 | $14.23B      | 8.24%         |
| 2023-11-30 | $14.15B      | 11.16%        |

Equity and ROE show some fluctuations, with ROE showing higher values in Q2 2024 and Q4 2023 than in other quarters.  The overall financial health appears reasonably stable, but the profitability metrics don't entirely explain the significant underperformance versus the S&P 500.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500, indicated by a substantially negative cumulative return and a projected extremely negative long-term return relative to the market benchmark. While some financial metrics are relatively stable, recent earnings show volatility and a recent revenue decline.  The high Beta suggests significant market sensitivity, amplifying both gains and losses.  The dramatically negative expected return (-349.4%) is a major red flag, casting serious doubt on its long-term prospects relative to the market.  A thorough investigation into the underlying causes of the underperformance is necessary before considering any investment.  The data suggests a high-risk investment at present.
