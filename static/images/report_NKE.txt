**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR & MDD:** CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been declining in recent years, with negative values for 2020-2025 periods. MDD (Maximum Drawdown) remains high, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha, which measures performance relative to the market (S&P 500), is strongly negative, showing that NKE has been significantly underperforming its benchmark. The last period (2023-2025) is particularly concerning with a -128% Alpha.
*   **Beta:** Beta, which measures volatility relative to the market, has been high in recent periods (2020-2024), suggesting that NKE's price fluctuations were more sensitive to market movements, amplifying both gains and losses.  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a negative Beta, indicating a potential shift in behavior.
*   **Cap:** The company's market capitalization (Cap(B)) has decreased significantly, reflecting the stock's poor performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $58.71
*   **Last Market Data:** Price $57.34, Previous Close: $57.22, Change: $0.21
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 64.99
    *   20-day SMA: 64.91
    *   60-day SMA: 65.93

**Analysis:** The price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60 day). This is a bearish signal, suggesting continued downward momentum in the short to medium term. The current market close price of $57.34 is well below the 5-day SMA of $64.99, indicating that the stock price has recently decreased.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 32.80
*   **PPO:** -0.48
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (25 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_0.41 Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -5.8 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3820.2, Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium MRI of 0.8 suggests a moderate risk level.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 32.80 indicates that the stock is approaching oversold conditions, which *could* suggest a potential for a bounce. *However*, given the overall negative sentiment and weak fundamentals, it's not a reliable signal on its own.
*   **PPO:** The PPO of -0.48 indicates that the shorter-term moving average is trading below the longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** A hybrid signal recommending buying is generated, however, the reliability of the hybrid signal is questionable given other strong negative indicators.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** A recent decrease in relative divergence suggests recent underperformance compared to the market, which confirms the short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of -3820.2% is extremely concerning, indicating a very pessimistic outlook for NKE's long-term performance compared to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

The news headlines are overwhelmingly negative:

*   "Nike Stock Drops on China Weakness, Margin Pressure and Outlook"
*   "Tariffs, China Weakness and Margin Guidance Keep Pressure on Shares"
*   "Earnings Disappointment Sends Nike Stock Below Key Support"
*   "Nike: There Is A Lot To Be Concerned About"
*   "Jim Cramer on Nike: “I Don’t Know When This Stock Will Make a Comeback, But I bet It Happens in the Next Year”
*    "Earnings Fallout, China Risks, Tariffs, and Wall Street Forecasts"

**Analysis:** These headlines highlight significant concerns around Nike's performance, particularly related to China, margins, and overall outlook. Jim Cramer's statement is not a ringing endorsement.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** ~Buy (Mean: 1.92)
*   **Target Price:** 77.24 / 120.00 / 35.00

**Analysis:** Despite the negative news, analyst consensus remains at "Buy". The wide range in target prices (35 to 120) suggests considerable uncertainty among analysts. The "Buy" rating may be lagging recent events or reflect a longer-term view that doesn't account for current headwinds. The target price is considerably higher than the current price, showing analysts consider the stock undervalued.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Overall:** Nike (NKE) is currently facing significant headwinds. The stock is underperforming the S&P 500 dramatically, with a very negative divergence and expected return.
*   **Negative Factors:** Declining revenue, decreasing profit margins, weak earnings results, negative news sentiment, and macroeconomic risks (China, tariffs) are all weighing on the stock.
*   **Technicals:** The stock is trading below its key moving averages, and while the RSI is approaching oversold, this isn't a reliable buy signal given the fundamental issues.
*   **Analyst Disconnect:** The analyst consensus remains at "Buy," but this seems optimistic given the recent data. The wide range in target prices suggests a lack of conviction.
*   **Recommendation:** While the oversold RSI and analyst "Buy" ratings might tempt some investors, the overwhelming weight of negative factors suggests caution. The expected return of -3820.2% is very pessimistic. Further analysis and monitoring are needed before considering an investment in NKE.
