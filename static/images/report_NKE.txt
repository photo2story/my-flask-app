**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:** The consistently negative alpha indicates that NKE has underperformed its expected return based on its beta and the market's return, particularly in recent years.
*   **Beta:** The beta values have decreased significantly, suggesting NKE's price movements have become less correlated with the overall market.
*   **CAGR & MDD:** The negative CAGR values and high MDD values in recent periods reflect the significant downturn in NKE's performance.

*   **Change:** -0.81 (-0.81%)

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** \$75.93
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** \$70.08

**Analysis:** The price has slightly decreased recently. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day, which is above the 60-day, suggesting a short-term upward trend, but the recent price decrease could signal a change in momentum.

*   **Expected Return:** -2284.5% (Significant underperformance vs. S&P 500 over the long term - highly suspect and needs verification)

**Analysis:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests low market risk. The RSI is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The positive change in relative divergence suggests a potential short-term improvement in performance compared to the S&P 500. The Hybrid Signal leans cautious, recommending reducing holdings and increasing cash.  The extremely negative expected return warrants further investigation, as it seems unrealistic.

**7. Overall Conclusion:**

Nike (NKE) is currently underperforming the S&P 500, with a substantial negative divergence.

Recent news suggests volatility and the need for careful monitoring. The extremely negative expected return value requires further verification and suggests caution.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Due Diligence:** Conduct thorough research into the factors contributing to the underperformance, including supply chain issues, competition, and changing consumer preferences.
*   **Monitor Earnings and Guidance:** Pay close attention to upcoming earnings reports and management's guidance for future performance.
*   **Risk Management:** Consider the high MDD and the cautious hybrid signal. Adjust portfolio allocation accordingly.
*   **Verify Expected Return:** The provided expected return seems unrealistic and should be independently verified.
