**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B)  |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| 2015-2017  | 18.0%  | 69.2%  | -11.0%  | 0.1    | 92.5    |

| 2023-2025  | -54.0% | 83.6%  | -118.0% | -0.7   | 97.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR has declined significantly in recent periods, indicating a worsening growth trend.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values indicate significant potential losses from peak to trough.  Nike has experienced high drawdowns recently.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently negative in recent periods, showing that NKE has underperformed its benchmark, even after adjusting for market risk.  The decline in Alpha is significant.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally positive, suggesting the stock moves in the same direction as the market. The increase in beta from 2020 to 2023 and subsequent decrease to -0.7 from 2023 to 2025 indicates that NKE's price fluctuations are more sensitive to overall market movements than before. This suggests NKE is more dependent on overall market performance.
*   **Cap (B) (Market Cap in Billions):**  Market capitalization has decreased significantly, particularly in recent years, reflecting the negative performance.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 65.63
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 65.63, Previous Close: 65.69, Change: -0.09
*   **5-day SMA:** 66.738
*   **20-day SMA:** 65.047
*   **60-day SMA:** 66.1088

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) but above the 20-day SMA.  This mixed signal doesn't provide a clear short-term trend.  Further analysis is required to determine a potential direction.

**3. RSI, PPO, MRI, Hybrid Signal & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 54.44 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.3236 (Neutral)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** 3.7 (+) (Short-term Increase)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (25 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_0.41 Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -565.3%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" risk level.
*   The RSI of 54.44 is near neutral, suggesting the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   The PPO of 0.3236 shows that the stock is slightly uptrending
*   The recent positive change in relative divergence (+3.7) indicates a short-term increase in the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500, possibly a temporary bounce.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests an aggressive approach (100% buy). However, the very high MRI score for the signal is not consistent with what's really happening with the company
*   The *extremely* negative expected return (-565.3%) is concerning and likely an anomaly or error in the calculation.  It should be investigated further.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출      |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| 2025-10-01 | 0.49 | 11.72 B$  |
| 2025-04-03 | 0.54 | 11.27 B$  |
| 2025-01-03 | 0.78 | 12.35 B$  |
| 2024-10-07 | 0.7  | 11.59 B$  |
| 2025-10-01 | 0.7  | 11.59 B$  |

**Analysis:**

*   EPS and revenue have been somewhat volatile in recent quarters.
*   Revenue generally follows a seasonal pattern, but the latest EPS of 0.49 compared to the previous of 0.7 (despite similar revenue) is a cause for concern. This decrease in EPS relative to revenue highlights the need to analyze the company's financials to understand why revenue is not translating into higher earnings.
*   The repeated value for 2025-10-01 looks like an error and may need to be corrected before further analysis.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Nike is facing a mixed outlook:

*   **Underperformance:** Significantly underperforming the S&P 500. The company needs to address its weaknesses and implement a strategy for sustained growth to reverse this trend.
*   **Negative Trends:** Declining CAGR, increasing MDD, and negative Alpha indicates challenges. The large reduction in earnings per share, decreasing profit margins, and lowered ROE point to underlying structural challenges in Nike's business.
*   **Short-Term Bounce:** A slight short-term increase in performance relative to the S&P 500 may provide temporary relief.
*   **News Sentiment:** Mixed, with concerns about China, tariffs, and margins despite earnings beats. The drop in the stock price following the earnings results underscores how investors are skeptical of future performance.
*   **Analyst Optimism:**  Analysts have an average "Buy" rating, but the wide range in price targets reflects uncertainty.
*   **Financial Concerns:** Declining profit margins and ROE are red flags that require further investigation.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the mixed signals and financial concerns, a **hold or cautious approach** is advised. While analysts are optimistic, the negative trends and headwinds suggest further analysis is required before making a buying decision. The investor update should be closely monitored for insights into Nike's future strategy. The extremely negative "Expected Return" should be verified and investigated, as it's likely an error or anomaly.
