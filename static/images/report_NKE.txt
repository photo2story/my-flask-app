**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's performance is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500.

The declining revenue and EPS in recent quarters further reinforce this negative assessment.  The significant variability in CAGR presented in the initial data also warrants further investigation. The absence of recent news and analyst opinions makes a complete and confident assessment impossible.  The conflicting Q4 2024 EPS data requires clarification.  Before making any investment decisions, further research into the underlying reasons for the negative trends and the methodology of the provided expected return is crucial.
