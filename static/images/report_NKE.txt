## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Nike Inc. is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

The cumulative return of NKE (10.69%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's cumulative return (128.86%).  The difference is -118.2%, placing it at the 1.9th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha values consistently exceed 1, suggesting that NKE has historically outperformed the market after adjusting for beta (market risk). However, recent performance (2021-2024) shows declining CAGR and increasing MDD, indicating significant risk and underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $78.34 (Last Market: $78.31)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $77.54
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $76.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $80.26

The price is currently below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating some short-term support.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (58.43):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum.
* **PPO (0.68):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (0.7+):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend in relative strength.  The relatively small value suggests the upward trend is not exceptionally strong.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500 is zero. This aligns with the historical underperformance relative to the market and requires cautious consideration.  The provided data does not provide a basis to confidently estimate a future rate of return.  The 0% expectation implies the potential for future performance to be similar to the benchmark index.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The most recent quarterly earnings show a downward trend in both EPS and revenue.  Specifically:

* **Revenue:** Shows a declining trend from Q1 2024 ($13.39B) to Q3 2024 ($11.59B).
* **EPS:**  Similarly, EPS has decreased from $1.04 in Q1 2024 to $0.70 in Q3 2024.  There is no information provided regarding whether these results beat or missed expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates, but profitability (profit margin) remains relatively stable around 44-45%, suggesting consistent operational efficiency. The recent slight decline in revenue and the decrease in EPS is a cause for concern.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been relatively stable, but ROE fluctuates, indicating some variability in the efficiency of capital utilization. The latest quarter shows a lower ROE than preceding quarters.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news or market outlook/analyst opinions are provided.  This information is crucial for a comprehensive analysis and would significantly influence the overall assessment.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been underwhelming, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. While historical data shows periods of outperformance (as indicated by alpha values), recent trends reveal declining revenue and EPS, along with a decrease in ROE. Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with some suggesting short-term upward momentum, while the long-term outlook needs more information.  The absence of recent news and analyst sentiment further complicates a complete assessment.  A zero expected return relative to the S&P 500, considering the provided data, reflects the current market sentiment of little to no additional return compared to the broad market index.  More information on recent market events and analyst opinions is essential for a thorough evaluation.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current data, a more in-depth analysis is needed.  A cautious approach is recommended pending further research into the reasons behind the recent decline in revenue and EPS, and incorporating recent news and analyst sentiment.  The current data does not support a strong buy recommendation.  Further investigation is required before making any investment decisions.
