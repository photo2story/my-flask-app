*   **Analysis:** The stock is trading below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, the price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, which *might* indicate a potential short-term stabilization. The negative change from the previous close confirms continued downward pressure.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 42.51 (Neutral – neither overbought nor oversold)

*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1095 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-02) - Signal is to invest fully.

*   **Expected Return:** -3067.2% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500, if dollar-cost averaging; Very Bearish)

    *   The MRI suggests a high level of investment is recommended.
    *   The RSI is neutral, not providing a strong buy or sell signal.
    *   The PPO is slightly positive, suggesting increasing momentum, albeit weak.
    *   The recent drop in price {price': 71.93, 'previousClose': 74.57, 'change': -3.54}, highlights a recent selloff. This is significant given the MRI, RSI and PPO values.
    *   **WARNING:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, especially considering the "Very Safe" designation and high MRI.
