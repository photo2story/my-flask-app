**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's performance relative to the S&P 500 is significantly underwhelming. While the company demonstrates stable revenue and high profit margins, the projected long-term return is considerably lower than the benchmark.  Technical indicators suggest an overbought condition, warranting caution.  The inconsistency in alpha and high volatility raise concerns about investment risk.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the EPS drop in Q4 2024 and the consistently negative projected alpha are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current data suggests that NKE is not a strong contender for outperformance against the broader market in the long term.
