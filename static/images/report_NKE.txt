**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Nike (NKE) has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  Recent stock price trends are downward, and the news sentiment is leaning negative. While analyst consensus is still "Buy," there's a wide range in target prices, signaling uncertainty.  EPS, revenue, profit margins, and ROE have shown some concerning trends. The exceptionally negative "Expected Return" number is a major concern and should be verified before acting on it. The MRI suggesting high investment despite other negative signs warrants further investigation.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on this data, a cautious approach to NKE is warranted. While the consensus is "Buy" and the MRI is suggesting strong investment, the negative return, divergence, recent performance metrics, and news sentiment present a more concerning picture. Further due diligence, including investigating the reasons behind the negative "Expected Return" and the discrepancies of high MRI with other factors, is highly recommended before making any investment decisions.
