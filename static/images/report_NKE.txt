* **Recent Relative Strength Change (+1.5):** Suggests a short-term upward movement.
* **Expected Return (-419.9%):** This extremely negative figure raises significant concern. This likely reflects the already realized losses and does not represent a forecast of future returns, which should be based on additional factors rather than past performance data alone. The extremely negative return emphasizes the need for careful consideration given the underperformance against the market.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or analyst opinions are provided.  This lack of information limits the ability to assess market outlook or potential catalysts for future price movements.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike is currently experiencing significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Recent quarterly earnings reveal a concerning decline in both EPS and revenue. While technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce due to oversold conditions, the negative expected return and overall bearish trend raise serious concerns. The company's relatively stable profit margins and ROE in spite of the falling revenue deserve attention.  More information, including the context around earnings expectations and recent news, is needed for a more complete assessment.  The current situation warrants caution for investors considering a long-term investment.   The significantly negative expected return (-419.9%) is not a reliable prediction of future returns and should be interpreted cautiously.


**8. Recommendation:**  Further investigation is required to make informed investment decisions about Nike, including a thorough review of recent news, analyst reports, and the companyâ€™s future guidance.  The data provided here suggests a bearish sentiment and the high negative expected return highlights considerable risk.  Any investment decision should be made after a comprehensive analysis, including detailed assessment of competitor analysis, market conditions, and management response to the current challenges.
