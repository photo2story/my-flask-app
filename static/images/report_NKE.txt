## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Nike Inc. (NKE) is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

The cumulative return for NKE is 3.67%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 120.68%.  The difference is -117.0%, placing it at the 8th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 based on the provided relative divergence.  This indicates considerable underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance relative to the market benchmark, but this is dwarfed by the substantial negative cumulative return difference.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $76.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $76.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $77.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $78.24

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.72 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.11 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.2% (Indicates recent downward price movement relative to a benchmark)
* **Expected Return:** -883.8% (This exceptionally negative figure suggests a significant downside risk prediction, requiring further investigation into its calculation methodology.  It's likely an error or a highly pessimistic, potentially unrealistic forecast.)

The current price of $76.94 is not significantly far from recent averages, not indicating a rapid price swing (sharp upturn or downturn). The extremely negative expected return needs clarification; its reliability is questionable.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a declining trend in both EPS and Revenue over the past few quarters:

* **Revenue:** Shows a fluctuating trend with a peak of $13.39B in Q1 2024, followed by a decrease to $11.59B in Q4 2024.  This represents a substantial decrease in revenue.
* **EPS:**  Similar to revenue, EPS has also experienced a decline, peaking at $1.04 in Q1 2024 and decreasing to $0.70 in Q4 2024.

There is no information provided to compare reported numbers to expectations, preventing the identification of "beats" or "misses".  The data solely shows a consistent downturn in both key financial metrics.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some volatility and a clear downward trend from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024. Profit margins are relatively stable, ranging from 44.21% to 45.36%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity fluctuates, and ROE demonstrates variability but generally maintains a double-digit percentage during the observed period (except for Q3 & Q4 2024).


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or analyst opinions are provided.  Information on the market outlook is absent.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NKE is currently underperforming significantly compared to the S&P 500, exhibiting a substantially negative cumulative return.  Technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, with the price below its moving averages.  Recent earnings data reveals a clear decline in both revenue and EPS over the last two quarters.  The extremely negative projected return needs clarification and validation.  The lack of recent news and market outlook information limits a comprehensive assessment.  More data is required to make robust investment recommendations.  The high negative expected return (-883.8%) is extremely implausible and requires investigation.


**8. Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the provided data.  It is not financial advice.  Before making any investment decisions, conduct thorough due diligence and consult with a qualified financial advisor.  The highly negative projected return should be scrutinized and potentially discarded unless its calculation methodology is validated.
