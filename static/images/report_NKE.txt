*   **Beta:**  Beta has generally been increasing, suggesting that Nike's price volatility has become more sensitive to market movements.  The negative beta in the most recent period (2023-2025) is unusual and could reflect specific company-related issues outweighing broader market trends.

*   **RSI:** 15.579 (Oversold)

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2605.3%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI indicates "Low Risk," which is a general market assessment and may not fully reflect Nike's specific situation.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is significantly oversold, suggesting the stock may be due for a rebound.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO confirms the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests a cautious approach, recommending a high cash position and minimal selling.
*   **Relative Divergence:** The negative change indicates that Nike's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 has worsened recently.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is an outlier. It's likely a result of the model extrapolating the recent significant underperformance far into the future. It should be interpreted with extreme caution.

### 7. Overall Summary

Nike's stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest a short-term downtrend and an oversold condition.  Recent news and analyst opinions are positive, citing potential revenue recovery catalysts.  However, recent financial data reveals declining revenue, profit margins, and ROE. The market risk indicator is low and the hybrid signal is very cautious (high cash position, minimal selling), which is difficult to interpret in light of positive analyst ratings but negative financial results

**Conclusion:**

The analysis presents a mixed picture.  Positive analyst sentiment and potential catalysts are counterbalanced by negative technical indicators, poor recent performance compared to the market, and declining financial metrics. While the oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, the longer-term trends warrant caution.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, a neutral to slightly cautious stance seems appropriate.  Investors should closely monitor Nike's upcoming earnings and financial performance to see if the anticipated revenue recovery materializes.  The extremely negative "expected return" should be disregarded.
