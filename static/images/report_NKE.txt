## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Nike Inc. (NKE), a leading designer and marketer of athletic footwear and apparel, currently shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  The stock exhibits negative returns, weak momentum indicators, and a high market risk indicator.  While recent earnings show some fluctuations, overall profitability remains strong. A deeper dive into the data is required to determine the long-term investment prospects.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **Company Overview:** Nike Inc. designs, develops, and markets athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories globally.

* **Cumulative Return (NKE):** -11.99%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 71.02%
* **Return Difference (NKE vs VOO):** -83.0% (This is significantly below the average historical difference based on the provided relative divergence data.)

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a fluctuating alpha and beta over the years.  Initially, the alpha was close to zero, indicating the stock's performance largely mirroring the market. However, it consistently increased to 1.2 in 2021-2023 and even reached 1.3 in 2022-2024 indicating it outperformed the market during those periods. Then in 2023-2025 it dropped sharply to 0.6.  Beta fluctuates between 0.0 and 1.3, which suggests that NKE is significantly more volatile than VOO. This is because the Beta is a measure of systematic risk and values above 1 imply the stock is more volatile than the market, in this case, the S&P 500.  High Beta implies higher risk. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values are highly volatile, indicating significant swings in performance and risk.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $61.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $68.15
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $72.59

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price increase of $3.0 could be considered a brief rebound, especially given the moving average trends which are all above the current price.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)  This suggests a relatively high level of risk associated with the stock.
* **RSI:** 14.62 (Oversold) A very low RSI value indicates the stock is significantly oversold.
* **PPO:** -1.82 (Bearish) A negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +9.7 (Short-term Upward Momentum) This points to recent upward movement, contrary to the long-term downtrend.
* **Expected Return:** -109.0% This is a highly negative expectation, suggesting significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This needs further investigation to ascertain accuracy, as it contradicts the alpha values presented.  Additional information is required to determine the underlying assumptions in this prediction.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NKE is currently experiencing significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, reflected in both cumulative returns and the -109.0% expected return (this figure requires further verification). Technical indicators point towards an oversold condition and bearish momentum, although recent price action shows a short-term upward trend. While the financial statements show relatively stable revenue and profitability, the considerable negative alpha and highly volatile beta values from the provided table must be investigated further.  The high market risk indicator (MRI) reinforces this concern. Further analysis is needed to determine if the current low price presents a buying opportunity or if the negative trend is set to continue. A thorough review of the assumptions behind the -109% expected return figure and a deeper examination of the conflicting alpha/beta values and other market factors are crucial before making any investment decisions.
