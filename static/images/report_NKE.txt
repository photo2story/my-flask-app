**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 36.53 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, but this should be interpreted cautiously in conjunction with other indicators.)
* **PPO:** -0.04 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -2.88 (Indicates a recent weakening in relative strength.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0% (This is the expected *excess* return relative to the S&P 500.  A 0% expected return implies that, based on this data, long-term returns might mirror those of the S&P 500, not surpass them).  This needs further validation.

**8. Overall Summary:**

Nike, despite its brand recognition, is currently experiencing underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent financial results show a weakening in EPS and some revenue decline. Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but this needs careful consideration. The consistent negative Alpha across multiple years raises concerns about its ability to outperform the market. Further investigation into the specific reasons behind the recent underperformance (macroeconomic factors, competitive landscape, internal issues), alongside a thorough analysis of the most recent earnings report and analyst forecasts, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The 0% expected return suggests that investors should not expect significant outperformance compared to a broad market index like the S&P 500 in the long term.
