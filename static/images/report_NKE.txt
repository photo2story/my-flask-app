## Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Performance Review

Nike Inc. is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Nike's cumulative return of -10.63% significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 76.08%.  This represents a divergence of -86.7%, placing it at the 12.4th percentile of its historical range (min: -105.4%, max: 45.2%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance over the years. While periods of strong positive Alpha (outperformance relative to the market) are observed (2017-2021),  recent years show dramatically negative CAGR and large negative Alpha, indicating substantial underperformance against the market. The high Beta values consistently above 1 suggest that NKE's price is more volatile than the market. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates considerably, suggesting market sentiment shifts. The large and increasing MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights significant risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $53.55
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $54.52
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $60.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $70.45

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend. The recent price change of -2.33 shows a significant drop from the previous closing price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 31.48 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.75 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +1.2 (Short-term upward momentum, but needs to be viewed in context of other indicators)
* **Expected Return:** -172.8% (This extremely negative expected return needs further clarification.  It's likely a miscalculation or reflects a very pessimistic outlook based on current trends and perhaps not reflective of long-term potential given an appropriate investment horizon.)

The significant price drop (-2.33) reflects a noticeable negative market event affecting Nike's stock.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500, marked by a substantial negative cumulative return and a high negative Alpha. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions and bearish momentum, although short-term indicators show some upward movement.  Earnings data shows inconsistent EPS and fluctuating revenue. While profit margins remain healthy, the recent decline needs further examination.  The extremely negative long-term expected return (-172.8%) provided requires further investigation. Overall, NKE presents a high-risk investment with significant underperformance relative to the market in the short term.  A thorough investigation of the reasons behind the recent underperformance is critical before making any investment decisions.  Long-term investors should carefully weigh the risks, especially considering the substantial drawdowns seen historically.
