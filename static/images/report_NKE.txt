## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Nike Inc. (NKE), a global leader in athletic footwear and apparel, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) recently. While showing periods of strong growth, the company's recent performance reveals substantial volatility and a negative outlook compared to the benchmark index.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying factors and assess future potential.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Nike's cumulative return (8.14%) is drastically lower than the S&P 500's (117.28%). The current divergence (-109.1%) places NKE at the 8.5th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high volatility in NKE's performance. While exhibiting periods of impressive CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), particularly between 2017-2021,  recent years (2021-2025) have seen dramatically negative returns, with high MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  The Beta values fluctuate, but generally suggest a higher sensitivity to market movements than the average stock. The high negative CAGR (-67% to -110%) in recent years is concerning.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $80.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $77.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $74.96
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.37

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent price increase.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day average indicates recent price stability.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.96 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.96 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength:** Recent 20-day relative strength shows a positive change (+7.2%), indicating a short-term upward trend.
* **Price Change:** A significant 4.94% increase from the previous close suggests a potential recent positive catalyst.
* **Expected Return:** -154.8%  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a major concern and needs further investigation.  This suggests that despite short-term price increases, long-term projections are bearish for NKE compared to VOO.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance is concerning. Despite strong financial fundamentals (high profit margins, reasonably stable revenue), the stock's dramatic underperformance against the S&P 500, coupled with a highly negative long-term expected return, raises serious questions. The high volatility and negative CAGR in recent years suggest significant headwinds.  The recent price increase may be a temporary rebound rather than a sustained trend reversal.  A deeper dive into the underlying factors affecting earnings, market sentiment, and competitive pressures is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further research is required to understand the causes behind the negative expected return and the significant underperformance relative to the market.  The provided data alone isn't sufficient to confidently recommend an investment strategy.
