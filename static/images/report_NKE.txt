## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Nike Inc. (NKE) is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

The cumulative return for NKE is 6.29%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 122.19%.  The difference is -115.9%, placing it at the 1.3 percentile of the historical range of divergence between NKE and the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided Alpha values consistently show a slight positive outperformance (0.1), but the Beta values suggest high sensitivity to market movements. The dramatic negative CAGR figures in the later years (-60% and -106%) further highlight the recent underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $78.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $78.76
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $76.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $79.83

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term bearish trend. The last market price of $78.86 is close enough to the closing price to not warrant a discussion of significant sudden movements.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.42 (Slightly above the neutral 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** 0.63 (Positive, indicating upward momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.3 (Indicates a recent short-term decline.)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests that, based on current data,  no significant excess return over the S&P 500 is expected for long-term (2+ years) investment,  considering the significant underperformance seen over the past year.)

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a declining trend in both EPS and revenue over the past four quarters.

* **Revenue:** Revenue peaked in 2024-01-05 at $13.39B and has been declining since then.
* **EPS:**  Similar to revenue, EPS experienced its highest point at $1.04 in 2024-01-05, showing a subsequent downward trend.  There is some inconsistency in the data (two entries for 2024-10-07 with differing EPS values) which limits definitive conclusions.

Without further context (like expected earnings figures), it's impossible to determine whether these results were "beats" or "misses."

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue fluctuates, and profit margins remain relatively stable around 44-45%, although thereâ€™s a slight downward trend.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows some fluctuation, while Return on Equity (ROE) varies, generally hovering around 8-11%.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or market outlook/analyst opinions were provided.  Therefore, no further analysis can be conducted based on this missing information.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike is currently experiencing significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While some short-term upward momentum is indicated by moving averages and a slightly positive PPO, the longer-term trend appears bearish, reflected in the declining revenue and EPS, and sharply negative CAGR values in the later years. The relatively stable profit margins and ROE offer some comfort, but the recent decline in revenue and earnings is a significant concern.  The missing recent news and market analysis prevents a fully informed conclusion. The 0% expected return suggests no compelling reason to expect outperformance against the broader market. Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent performance decline and a review of current market sentiment are necessary for a more comprehensive evaluation.
