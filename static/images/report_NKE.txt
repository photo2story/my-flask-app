| 2023-2025  | -51.0%  | 83.6% | -115.0% | -0.7   | 102.1  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate has been highly volatile, ranging from negative returns to substantial growth.  Recent periods show significant negative growth.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and potential for significant losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative in recent years, suggesting underperformance relative to its benchmark.  The significant negative alpha in the most recent period is concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates, suggesting varying degrees of volatility relative to the market. Recent high betas suggest the stock was very reactive to market movements and -0.7 means less correlation with market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has generally decreased in recent periods.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement:**

*   **Current Price:** 69.09
*   **Previous Close:** 68.91
*   **Change:** 0.26
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 71.134
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 71.6357
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 74.2711

**Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60 day). This indicates a short-term and potentially intermediate-term downtrend. The small price increase from the previous close doesn't offset the overall downward trend suggested by the moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.81 (Neutral, but trending towards oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.1392 (Below zero, indicating bearish momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1095 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-02)
*   **Recent Relative Deviation Change (20-day):** -0.6 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3125.5 (Significantly negative)

**Analysis:**

*   Despite the "High Investment Recommended" MRI, other indicators paint a less optimistic picture.
*   The RSI is below 50, suggesting weakening momentum.
*   The negative PPO confirms bearish momentum.
*   The negative change in relative deviation further supports the short-term decline.
*   The extremely negative expected return is a major cause for concern. This suggests the model projects significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 even with long-term dollar-cost averaging.
*   The small price change from the previous close reflects very minimal upward price pressure.
* The Hybrid Signal may be generated by overly optimistic MRI, but is not consistent with the other indicators.
