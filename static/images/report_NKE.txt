**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Nike Inc. (NKE) is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.  The provided data shows NKE's cumulative return at 10.69%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%. The difference is -118.2%, placing it in the 1.9th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates NKE's substantial underperformance compared to the broader market over the measured period.  The provided alpha and beta values demonstrate periods of outperformance (positive alpha) and periods of underperformance (negative alpha) compared to the market benchmark.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided table reveals significant fluctuation in NKE's performance relative to the S&P 500. While some periods show high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and positive alpha (outperforming the market), others reveal significant underperformance, particularly in recent years (2022-2024). The beta consistently hovers around 1.5-2.0, indicating higher volatility than the overall market.  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures highlight significant potential losses during market downturns.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $78.34 (Last Market: $78.31)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $77.54
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $76.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $80.26

The price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend in the short- to medium-term.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the last market price suggests limited significant price action on the last trading day.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.43 - This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral short-term trend.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.68 - A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, although the relatively low value suggests the momentum may be weakening.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** 0.7 (+) â€“ This signifies a short-term upward trend, possibly indicating a short-term recovery or bounce.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The provided expected return of 0% suggests that, based on the available information, there is no significant expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investments. This should be viewed cautiously; long-term returns are not predictable with certainty.

Given that the last market price ($78.31) is very close to the closing price ($78.34), there is no evidence of a significant recent price jump (rapid rise or fall).

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows a decline in EPS and revenue in recent quarters. While the revenue figures remain in the billions, there's a clear downward trend from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024.  Comparing the results with any expected figures would require that information.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind this decline.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has fluctuated, while profit margins have remained relatively stable around 44-45%.  This shows a consistent profitability but suggests revenue growth has slowed or stagnated.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity and ROE (Return on Equity) show some fluctuation but largely remain stable. This points towards a generally healthy financial position but requires further context.
