## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Review

This report analyzes Nike Inc. (NKE), a leading designer, developer, and marketer of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories.

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Nike's cumulative return (-4.38%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.43%.  The divergence is substantial (-120.8%), placing it at the 0.1 percentile of the historical range of its relative performance against the S&P 500. This indicates a considerable underperformance compared to the market benchmark. The provided CAGR data shows periods of strong growth, particularly between 2017 and 2020, followed by a sharp decline in recent years.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values further highlight the volatility experienced, particularly in the last few years.  The consistently low alpha (around 0.1) suggests that NKE's performance has largely tracked the market, with limited excess returns.  The beta of approximately 0.1 is unusually low and may indicate inaccuracies in the calculation or an unusual market decoupling event.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $70.96
* **Last Market Price:** $71.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.30
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $74.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $76.26

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The gap between the current price and the moving averages suggests potential further downside.  The Last Market Price of $71.09 being slightly higher than the closing price suggests a potential slight upward movement at market close. No significant recent price jumps (rapid increase or decrease) are evident.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 21.17 (Significantly below 30, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.44 (Negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Indicates a recent downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -1091.1% (This extremely negative figure requires clarification;  it likely represents an error in calculation or misunderstanding of what is being measured.  Perhaps it is a comparison of expected future return to S&P 500 based on current parameters?)

The low RSI and negative PPO reinforce the bearish sentiment.  The negative expected return warrants further investigation to understand its basis.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  There's a notable drop in EPS from Q1 2024 ($1.04) to Q2 and Q3 2024 (around $0.70),  followed by a recovery to $0.78 in Q4 2025. Revenue also shows slight volatility, though the overall trend isn't clearly bearish or bullish within the provided timeframe. A longer time series is needed for a more comprehensive analysis.  The apparent duplication of the 2025-01-03 data point should be investigated and clarified.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows slight volatility, but profit margins remain relatively stable around 44-45%,  indicating consistent profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows some fluctuation, while ROE is inconsistent, ranging from 7.54% to 11.16%. This inconsistency warrants a deeper analysis to determine the underlying drivers.

The financial data suggests overall solid profitability but requires further investigation into the variations in ROE to understand the underlying factors influencing this metric.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's stock performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 in recent periods. Technical indicators point towards a bearish trend, with oversold conditions according to RSI.  While profitability remains generally strong, concerns arise from the declining ROE and the volatile earnings data.  The unusually low beta value needs further investigation.  The extremely low expected return requires clarification, and it's likely an error or misinterpretation. Overall, the data suggests a cautious outlook on NKE, particularly for short-term investors.  Further analysis with a longer time frame is recommended to establish the long-term picture and to properly determine the meaning of the provided expected return.  The inconsistent and sometimes contradictory data points (such as the unusually low beta and the extremely negative expected return) suggest either data errors or a significant market event affecting NKE's performance which requires further analysis.
