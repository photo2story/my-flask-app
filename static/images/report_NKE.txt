## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Performance Review

**0. Overview:** Nike, Inc. is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Nike's cumulative return of -14.21% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's return of 66.69% over the analyzed period.  The difference is a substantial -80.9%, placing it at the 10.2nd percentile of the historical range (-95.5% to 48.2%). This indicates Nike's performance has fallen considerably below the broader market.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different time periods.  While alpha is sometimes positive (indicating outperformance), suggesting periods of outperformance relative to the market, it's consistently lower than in previous periods.  The rising beta signifies increasing market sensitivity;  NKE's price movements are becoming increasingly correlated with overall market fluctuations.  Note the significant drop in CAGR in recent years, culminating in extremely negative figures. This suggests that Nike is facing significant headwinds, and  the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values point to periods of substantial losses.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistency.  While revenue fluctuates, EPS isn't showing a clear upward trend. Revenue numbers show decline in recent quarters.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying reasons for these fluctuations.

|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-04-03 | 0.54 | $11.27 B      |

| 2024-02-29 | $14.23B | 8.24%  |

Revenue shows some fluctuation. Profit margins are generally high but have slightly declined recently. ROE is volatile.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's stock is currently underperforming the market significantly.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the strong downtrend, coupled with negative CAGR and high MDD values from the alpha/beta analysis, raise serious concerns.  While profit margins remain healthy, recent earnings data and revenue figures reveal weakening performance. The extremely negative projected long-term return needs further verification.  A thorough investigation into the reasons behind declining CAGR and the extremely negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Given the current state, a cautious approach is recommended.  Further investigation into macroeconomic factors and company-specific news is necessary to gain a more complete understanding of NKE's future prospects. The -168.5% expected return is likely an error and requires clarification.
