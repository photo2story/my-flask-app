| 2023-2025  | -60.0% | 83.6%  | -128.0%  | -0.7     | 90.1   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows strong growth in the periods leading up to 2021, followed by significant declines in recent years.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown is high across the board, indicating substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha has been mostly negative in recent years, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark after accounting for risk. The most recent period shows a very significant negative alpha of -128%.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates. High beta values (closer to 2 or higher) in 2020-2024 periods suggests the stock was more volatile than the market during these times. The negative beta for 2023-2025 is unusual.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization generally increased until 2021 and has declined since.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 60.93
*   **Previous Close:** 60.00
*   **Change:** 1.55
*   **5-day SMA:** 58.84
*   **20-day SMA:** 64.05
*   **60-day SMA:** 65.16

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently showing a slight increase. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating a short-term upward trend after recent declines. The price bounced from about 58 to 61 in the last 5 days.

**3) Index Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - *This is counter-intuitive given the other data, and may not be a reliable indicator in this case.*
*   **RSI:** 38.69 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.08 (Negative, suggesting a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (25 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_0.41 Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -5.8 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -3820.2%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests high investment, but this is not aligning with other indicators.
*   The RSI is below 40, edging towards oversold conditions, which could suggest a potential buying opportunity *if* the fundamentals support it.
*   The PPO is negative, suggesting the price is trading lower than it has in the recent past.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" is recommending a full investment (buying 100% with cash), but this should be viewed with extreme caution given the negative returns and divergence.
*   The negative expected return of -3820.2% is extremely concerning. This implies very significant expected losses if investing from this point.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   The news headlines are mixed. Some articles highlight Tim Cook's purchase driving the stock higher, while others discuss what to watch for in 2026 and whether the stock is a buying opportunity *after* a crash. One analyst advises caution ("Lace Up, But Don’t Sprint").

**Analysis:** The news is cautiously optimistic, with some positive catalysts (like Tim Cook's purchase) but also acknowledgment of underlying challenges.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.92)
*   **Target Price:** 77.24 (Average), 120.00 (High), 35.00 (Low)

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating with a significant average target price above the current price. However, the wide range of target prices (35.00 to 120.00) indicates considerable uncertainty. Recent rating changes are not available.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출      |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-10-01 | 0.49 | 11.72 B$  |

| 2025-10-01 | 0.7  | 11.59 B$  |

**Analysis:** EPS (Earnings Per Share) has been fluctuating. Recent EPS figures are lower than those from earlier periods, which could contribute to the stock's underperformance. Revenue has also fluctuated but shows some consistency.

**Analysis:** Revenue has been somewhat volatile but generally strong. Profit margins are consistently above 40%. Equity has slightly decreased over the past year. ROE (Return on Equity) has also fluctuated, with a significant drop in one quarter, suggesting inconsistent profitability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Negative Performance:** Nike has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative cumulative return divergence.
*   **Declining Trend:** The stock is currently in a downtrend, as shown by the negative PPO and recent divergence change.
*   **Earnings Concerns:** EPS has been declining.
*   **Mixed Signals:** While analysts have a "Buy" rating, the very large negative expected return and high risk indicators suggest caution.
*   **News is Mixed:** Recent news provides some optimism, but other information highlights the challenges that Nike is currently facing.

**Conclusion:**

The data presents a concerning picture for Nike stock. While some indicators (like the MRI and analyst ratings) might seem positive, the negative returns, high volatility, declining earnings, and extremely low expected return strongly suggest that an investment in Nike at this time would be very risky. The news cycle needs to be monitored for fundamental changes in NKE's prospects before even considering the stock for investment.
