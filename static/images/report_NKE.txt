**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Nike (NKE) is facing significant headwinds. While recent earnings might have technically "beat" expectations, the stock price has tumbled due to deeper concerns about China sales, tariff impacts, and overall profitability. The stock is in a clear downtrend, trading below its key moving averages. The RSI suggests it's nearing oversold, which might lead to a temporary bounce, but the negative Alpha, high Beta, and poor expected return indicate longer-term underperformance relative to the market.

Analysts still have a "Buy" consensus, but the wide target price range reflects the considerable uncertainty surrounding the stock. Financial metrics show declining revenue, profit margins, and ROE.

**Overall Recommendation:**

While a short-term bounce is possible due to oversold conditions, the fundamental challenges and negative sentiment surrounding the stock suggest caution. A more in-depth investigation into the China sales decline and tariff impacts is needed before considering a long-term investment.
