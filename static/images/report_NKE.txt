**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 20.0% | 58.9% | -13.0% | 0.0 | 84.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 3.0% | 12.6% | -18.0% | -0.0 | 101.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 60.0% | 12.6% | 27.0% | 0.6 | 140.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 71.0% | 59.7% | 41.0% | 1.0 | 198.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 79.0% | 59.7% | 19.0% | 1.1 | 235.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 1.0% | 73.8% | -8.0% | 1.2 | 166.8 |
| 2021-2023  | -36.0% | 73.8% | -57.0% | 1.3 | 156.8 |
| 2022-2024  | -80.0% | 73.8% | -100.0% | 1.6 | 111.1 |
| 2023-2025  | -69.0% | 83.7% | 0.1 | 86.3 |


The data shows periods of strong performance (e.g., 2017-2021), with high CAGR and positive alpha. However, recent years (2021-2025) show significant negative returns, indicating a substantial downturn. The beta values suggest NKE's price movements are highly correlated to the overall market, though increasing beta implies higher market sensitivity in recent periods.  The consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD)  is a significant concern.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $58.48
* **5-day Moving Average:** $56.96
* **20-day Moving Average:** $58.04
* **60-day Moving Average:** $69.03

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.  The recent 1.9% price increase from the previous close (`Last-market`) shows a small positive change.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.93 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 1.11 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.8 (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return:** -238.6% (This is a concerningly negative long-term projection relative to the S&P 500 and needs further investigation on its calculation methodology.)

The combination of indicators paints a mixed picture. While some suggest potential upward movement, the negative expected return and recent relative divergence signal caution.  The small price increase needs to be interpreted carefully within the context of the overall market trend and longer-term performance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2025-04-03 | $0.54 | $11.27B       |
| 2025-01-03 | $0.78 | $12.35B       |
| 2024-10-07 | $0.70 | $11.59B       |
| 2024-04-04 | $0.77 | $12.43B       |
| 2025-04-03 | $0.77 | $12.43B       |

Note: There seems to be a duplicate entry for 2025-04-03.  Assuming this is an error and using the first entry: Revenue shows some volatility, with a recent decline. EPS is also inconsistent, showing a decrease in the latest quarter (2025-04-03).  Further investigation of these figures is needed.

| 2024-02-29 | $14.23B     | 8.24%         |

Revenue shows fluctuation but remains generally high. Profit margins are healthy but have decreased slightly in the most recent quarter.  ROE is also volatile.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been disappointing, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  While some positive technical indicators exist, the negative expected return and significant recent price decline are major concerns.  The inconsistent earnings data requires further clarification.  A thorough analysis of the -238.6% expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  High MDD values also raise significant concerns about risk.  Before investing, consider conducting further research to understand the underlying reasons for the recent underperformance, the validity of the expected return projection and to gauge the overall market outlook for athletic apparel.  The data suggests a cautious approach is warranted.
