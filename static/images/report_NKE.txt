**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a decline in both EPS and revenue over the past few quarters.  While revenue was relatively stable during parts of 2023, it has declined in the most recent reporting period.  EPS has generally followed a decline from Q1 2024 (1.04) to a lower value in subsequent quarters.  There is no information available to compare these figures against analyst expectations to assess any "beats" or "misses."

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has fluctuated but shows a slight downward trend. Profit margins have remained relatively stable, around 44-45%, indicating consistent profitability. The most recent revenue figure is $11.59B which shows a decline from previous quarters in the period.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally increased, although there has been some fluctuation in recent quarters. ROE has also been inconsistent, fluctuating between 7.54% and 11.16%, indicating variability in the return generated on shareholder equity.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook or analyst opinions are provided within the given data.  To obtain this information, external resources (financial news websites, analyst reports) would be required.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the period covered by the data provided. While some technical indicators hint at potential bullish momentum (PPO), the recent price action and declining revenue and EPS suggest a bearish trend. The relatively stable profit margins provide a degree of underlying strength. However, the significant underperformance relative to the market and lack of positive expected returns raise concerns.  Further investigation into the reasons for declining revenue and EPS, along with external market analysis and news, would be necessary for a complete assessment. The lack of context and detail regarding the provided alpha, beta and expected return values limits the validity of these findings.
