*   The Expected Return of 0.0% indicates that the model doesn't anticipate significant excess returns compared to the S&P 500 in the long term based on current conditions.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Insider Buying:** Multiple articles report significant insider purchases by the CEO (Elliott Hill) and a director (Tim Cook). This is generally seen as a positive signal, suggesting that those with the most knowledge of the company believe the stock is undervalued.
*   **Contrarian Buy:** One article suggests Nike as a contrarian buy for 2026, as it was among the Dow Jones stocks that fell over 10% in 2025.
*   **Options Activity:** Another article mentions unusual options activity, which could indicate increased interest from institutional investors or large traders, but needs further investigation to determine if it's bullish or bearish.

**Analysis:** The recent news is largely positive, particularly the insider buying activity. This suggests confidence within the company's leadership. The "contrarian buy" narrative also suggests a potential opportunity if the stock is currently undervalued.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Buy" with a mean rating around the "Buy" level.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Nike has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, with negative returns and a large negative divergence. The Alpha reflects this underperformance, and the high Maximum Drawdowns indicate substantial risk. While the stock shows a recent short-term upward trend, it's still below its medium-term moving average. The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, but the model provides a very safe hybrid signal which goes against it. Recent news around insider buying is positive, signaling confidence from within the company. Analyst consensus is "Buy," but the wide range in target prices suggests uncertainty. Recent EPS and revenue figures have fluctuated, and the decreasing ROE trend is concerning.

**In summary:** Nike presents a mixed picture. While there are positive signs like insider buying, analyst ratings, and a recent price bounce, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, declining profitability metrics (profit margin, ROE), and high historical volatility (MDD) warrant caution.
