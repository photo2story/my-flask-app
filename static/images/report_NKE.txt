* **20-Day Moving Average:** 76.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 80.22

The price is currently below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downtrend. However, it's above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating some short-term support.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** 0.75 – Positive, suggesting bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:**  `nan (-):` Indicates a recent downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% –  This indicates that, based on the given data, there is no expected excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is a very low expected return relative to risk, considering the historical volatility.

Given that the Last-market price (78.67) is not significantly different from the closing price (78.77), there is no evidence of a sharp price movement (neither a rapid surge nor a sharp drop).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The latest quarterly earnings show a decline in EPS and revenue compared to the previous quarters. There is inconsistency in the reporting of the Oct 7, 2024 quarter, with one entry showing EPS of 0.7 and another entry of 0.95.  Revenue is also down in the most recent quarter (August 2024).  This indicates a concerning trend of declining profitability and revenue generation.  Without additional information regarding market expectations, it's impossible to determine if there were any beats or misses.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Both Revenue and Profit Margin show a declining trend in recent quarters, indicating potential weakening performance.  Equity fluctuates, and ROE demonstrates considerable variability, signaling uncertainty in the company's profitability and efficiency in utilizing shareholder's equity.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions, which wasn't provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the period considered.  Recent financial performance shows a downward trend in both revenue and EPS, raising concerns about the company's future prospects. Technical indicators suggest a slightly positive momentum, but the overall picture indicates weakness. The very low expected return relative to the broader market, combined with high historical volatility, makes the investment outlook uncertain.  Further investigation into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a more complete assessment.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, declining financial performance and the high volatility, a cautious approach is recommended.  Further due diligence is needed, particularly focusing on the reasons for the recent decline in revenue and EPS, and an assessment of the company’s strategic response.  The provided data alone does not support a strong buy recommendation.  A thorough analysis of current market conditions and future forecasts should be conducted before making any investment decisions.
