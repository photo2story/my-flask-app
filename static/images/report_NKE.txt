## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Report

**0) Overview:** Nike Inc. is a multinational corporation engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and worldwide marketing and sales of footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Nike's cumulative return of -14.45% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 66.36%, resulting in a large divergence of -80.8%. This places Nike at the 10.2nd percentile of its historical range of relative performance against the S&P 500 (using the provided min/max range).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market.  While some periods (2017-2021) exhibit high CAGR and positive alpha, indicating outperformance, recent years (2021-2025) show substantial negative returns and increasing beta, suggesting higher market sensitivity and underperformance.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures in several periods also highlight significant risk.

| 2015-2017  | 18.0% | 59.1% | -11.0% | 0.1 | 84.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 1.0% | 12.6% | -17.0% | 0.1 | 101.7 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is $54.39, slightly down from the previous close.  Moving averages suggest a downtrend:

* 5-day moving average: $55.40
* 20-day moving average: $63.58
* 60-day moving average: $71.29

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47, indicating a high-risk environment.
* **RSI:** 29.62, suggesting the stock is oversold.
* **PPO:** -1.40, indicating bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength:**  The recent 20-day relative strength divergence of -7.5 points to a short-term downtrend.
* **Expected Return:** A projected -167.4% indicates a significant potential for further losses. This extremely negative expected return, especially considering the projected return is relative to S&P 500, requires further investigation to understand the basis for such a pessimistic outlook.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy is suggested, but the exceptionally negative expected return warrants careful consideration of risk tolerance. The small price change (-$0.02) does not suggest any immediate drastic price movements (like a sharp rebound or a crash).


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2025-04-03).  There's a noticeable fluctuation in both EPS and revenue, lacking a clear trend.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying reasons for these fluctuations.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue      |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| 2025-04-03 | 0.54 | $11.27 B     |
| 2025-01-03 | 0.78 | $12.35 B     |
| 2024-10-07 | 0.70 | $11.59 B     |
| 2024-04-04 | 0.77 | $12.43 B     |
| 2025-04-03 | 0.77 | $12.43 B     |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue has fluctuated but generally remains strong, although there is a recent decline. Profit margins are healthy and relatively stable. Equity is also relatively stable, while Return on Equity (ROE) shows some fluctuation.  Overall, the financial picture appears relatively sound, but further analysis would be beneficial.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-02-28 | $11.27B | 41.49% |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the extremely negative expected return and the high risk indicated by the MRI warrant caution. While the fundamentals (revenue and profitability) appear relatively sound,  the inconsistent earnings data and the significant underperformance relative to the market raise serious concerns.  The -167.4% expected return requires thorough investigation and validation, as it is likely an outlier or based on specific assumptions not detailed here.  A long-term investment strategy could be considered, but only with a very high risk tolerance given the current data.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent poor performance and the basis for the extreme negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.
