## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Nike Inc. is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

The provided data shows a significant underperformance of NKE compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  NKE's cumulative return is 10.39%, while VOO's is 122.83%.  The difference is a massive -112.44%. The relative divergence of -122.7 places NKE at the 0.1 percentile within the historical range of its performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates considerable underperformance.  The provided CAGR data in the table also reflects a significant decline in performance in recent years, culminating in very negative returns from 2020 onwards.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $74.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $72.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.428
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.8004

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum, but below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend in the longer term. The recent price change of $0.34 suggests minor upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.30  (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions but leaning towards bearish)
* **PPO:** 0.40 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum, though the value is relatively low)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +0.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -1153.4% (This extremely negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and needs further investigation to verify its source and methodology.  It suggests significant underperformance is anticipated.)

The small positive change in price is not significant enough to classify as a sharp rebound.  The extremely negative expected return warrants a deeper look into the underlying assumptions and the reliability of the projection.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue.  While there's a general upward trend in revenue over time, EPS shows inconsistency. The repetition of the January 3rd, 2025 data point suggests an error in the data set.  A more reliable data source is needed for a proper analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates but generally remains high. Profit margins are consistently high (around 44%), indicating strong profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable, while ROE shows some fluctuation, indicating variability in the company's efficiency in using its equity to generate profits.  ROE is mostly in the high single digits which is acceptable but not particularly outstanding.

There is no significant negative trend evident in the financial data. However, this must be interpreted alongside the concerning stock performance relative to the market.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's stock performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, shown by both the cumulative return and the CAGR figures.  While the company exhibits strong revenue and profitability in its financial statements,  this hasn't translated into commensurate stock market performance.  The extremely negative projected long-term return requires further scrutiny. The technical indicators provide a mixed signal, with some suggestion of short-term upward momentum but overall caution is needed given the substantial underperformance against the market and the negative projected returns.  The volatile EPS numbers and the inconsistent financial data require verification from another source before any strong conclusions can be drawn.  Further investigation into the source of the -1153.4% expected return is essential.  Overall, the data presents a mixed picture, requiring further analysis and potentially additional data points to arrive at a well-informed conclusion.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the highly negative projected return, a cautious approach is advised.  Before considering any investment in NKE, it is crucial to:

* **Verify the data:** Reconcile the discrepancies in the provided data, particularly the repeated earnings data point and the source of the extremely negative expected return projection.  Use a reliable financial data provider to cross-check the numbers.
* **Conduct thorough fundamental analysis:**  Dig deeper into Nike's business fundamentals to understand the reasons behind its underperformance.  Consider factors such as competition, market saturation, consumer trends, and macroeconomic conditions.
* **Analyze the competitive landscape:**  Compare Nike's performance and outlook with its competitors.
* **Review management's guidance:**  Evaluate management's expectations for future performance and their strategies to address current challenges.

Only after completing this thorough due diligence, can an informed investment decision be made.  The current data does not provide sufficient evidence to confidently recommend an investment in NKE.
