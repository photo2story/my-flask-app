## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Summary:**

Nike Inc. is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

As of the last data point, NKE's cumulative return is 5.54%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 121.09%.  The provided analysis shows a large negative divergence of -115.5%, placing it at the 3.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial underperformance compared to the broader market. The provided CAGR data shows a highly volatile performance over the past years, with periods of significant growth followed by substantial declines.  The recent years show considerable negative growth (-60%, -110%, -70%). This volatility makes long-term projections challenging.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $78.33
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $75.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.65

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively small gap between the 5-day and 60-day moving averages indicates moderate momentum.  The recent price change of $2.29 (from the previous close) reflects a positive short-term movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.88 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO:** 1.05 – A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +3.7 – This confirms the short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -306.8% –  This exceptionally negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern and suggests a very high risk.  Given the historical volatility and recent negative growth, achieving a positive return that outperforms the S&P 500 is unlikely without a fundamental shift in the company's performance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility. While revenue generally increased over the reported period,  EPS is inconsistent, and the most recent EPS of 0.78 is lower than the previous quarter's 1.04.  There is a need for further analysis to determine the reasons behind this variation. Further investigation is needed into the cause of this fluctuation.  More data points over a longer period would provide a clearer picture.  The repeated 1.04/13.39B data point for 2025-01-03 is duplicated and requires clarification.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows some volatility, but generally remains high, though there is a noticeable decline from 13.39B to 12.35B.  Further investigation into the revenue sources and market dynamics would be necessary for a more complete understanding.

* **Profit Margin:** Profit margin is consistently high (around 44%), suggesting strong profitability.  However, the recent slight decline should be monitored.

* **Equity & ROE:** Equity shows relative stability, with ROE fluctuating between 7.54% and 11.16%.  Again, further analysis of the underlying factors is necessary for informed interpretation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance is concerning. While the company shows consistently high profit margins and generally strong revenue, the stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest an overbought market and the exceptionally negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major red flag.  The volatile earnings and revenue data points warrant a closer look at the underlying business factors influencing Nike's performance. The high RSI and the negative projected return coupled with the significant underperformance relative to the broader market significantly increase the risk associated with investing in NKE.  A long-term investment strategy should consider these risks and incorporate diversification to mitigate potential losses.   More detailed fundamental analysis, including competitive landscape, management strategies, and market trends is crucial before making any investment decision.
