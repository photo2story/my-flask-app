**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출        |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-10-01 | 0.49 | 11.72 B$    |
| 2025-04-03 | 0.54 | 11.27 B$    |
| 2025-01-03 | 0.78 | 12.35 B$    |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has fluctuated, with a recent dip in EPS for the most recent quarter. The repeated dates (2025-10-01 and 2024-10-07) are confusing, and further clarification is needed to interpret the numbers correctly.  Assuming the second 2025-10-01 is an error and should be 2024-07-XX (or a previous date), it shows a recent slight decline in EPS.

Monitoring upcoming earnings reports and further news developments is crucial to assess whether the company can reverse its recent trends.
