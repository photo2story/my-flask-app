The recent price increase of 0.6% could be significant depending on the context (news, market conditions).  The moving averages also suggest a relatively steady uptrend over the last 60 days.

*   **RSI:** 46.23 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.18 (Slightly Negative - indicates potential downward pressure, but relatively weak)

*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (20-day):** -0.3 (Negative - indicates short-term underperformance compared to the market)

*   **Analysis:** The technical indicators paint a mixed picture. The Low-Risk MRI is somewhat contradictory to the very negative expected return and underperformance trends. The RSI is neutral. The PPO is slightly negative. The negative change in relative divergence confirms recent underperformance. The extremely large negative Expected Return is a major red flag. The Hybrid signal is calling for selling a small portion of holdings.
