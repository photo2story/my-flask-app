## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:** Nike Inc. (NKE), a leading designer, developer, and marketer of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment, is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO).  While recent earnings show some fluctuation, key financial metrics and technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook, with a substantial negative expected return relative to the S&P 500.


**1) Performance Comparison:**

Nike's cumulative return is -14.36%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a 56.46% return.  This results in a significant divergence of -70.8%, placing it at the 17.2nd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-95.5% to 48.2%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values across different time periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), recent years show negative CAGR and increasingly high beta (higher market sensitivity). This suggests NKE's performance is increasingly linked to broader market movements, and its historical outperformance is not guaranteed.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Nike is currently underperforming the market significantly. While the RSI suggests potential short-term upside, the negative expected return, bearish technical indicators, and inconsistent historical performance relative to the market present a cautious outlook. The recent price drop further reinforces the bearish trend.  A long-term investment in NKE carries substantial risk compared to the S&P 500, given the projected underperformance.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent underperformance is necessary before making any investment decision.  The duplicated data entry in the earnings report should also be clarified.
