* **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.4247 suggests a low to medium risk level.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Nike (NKE) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, showing a large negative cumulative return compared to the market benchmark. While the company shows consistent profitability, recent quarters have seen a decline in revenue and EPS.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but the sharp recent price drop and negative momentum warrant caution.  The extremely negative projected return (-263.9%) needs further investigation and clarification.  A deeper dive into the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors is needed for a more comprehensive assessment.  The data provided gives a snapshot of significant underperformance and warrants further in-depth research before making any investment decisions.  The -112.2% relative performance to the S&P 500 suggests that, within the context of the provided data, NKE represents a high-risk investment, especially given the volatility shown by beta and ROE.
