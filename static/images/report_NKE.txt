*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), suggesting a downtrend. The significant negative change in the last market session (-1.68%) confirms this bearish momentum.

### 3. Technical Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 40.67 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet there)
*   **PPO:** 0.2382 (Positive, suggesting slight bullish momentum, but close to zero)

*   **Expected Return:** -1437.3% (Very negative, indicating significant projected underperformance vs. S&P 500 over the long term if investing today)
*   **Analysis:** While the MRI suggests high investment, other indicators paint a less optimistic picture. The negative divergence change and extremely negative expected return are concerning. The Hybrid signal contradicts the other data points, likely based solely on the high MRI. The price drop in the last market session could be a reflection of market reactions to news and broader economic conditions.
