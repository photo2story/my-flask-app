## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Nike Inc. (NKE) is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.  As of the last data point, NKE's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is -116.32%, placing it at the 2.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows periods of strong performance (e.g., 2017-2019, 2018-2020) interspersed with periods of significant underperformance (e.g., 2021-2023, 2022-2024).  The beta consistently hovers around 1.0, suggesting NKE's price movements are closely correlated with the overall market, though with increased volatility in recent years as shown by the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $79.26 (Last Market: $79.28)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $75.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $76.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $80.37

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the last market price suggests minimal recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 54.2  -  Slightly above the neutral level of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.53 - Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** 0.0 (-) - Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% - The provided expected return of 0% suggests that, given the current information,  long-term (2+ years) investment in NKE is not expected to outperform the S&P 500.  This should be interpreted cautiously, as this is a single point prediction and subject to change.
* **Market Outlook:**  The fact that the last market price ($79.28) is slightly higher than the closing price ($79.26) does not significantly suggest a dramatic upswing or downswing. More context is needed.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data shows a downward trend in both EPS and revenue from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024. While the October 2024 data point is repeated, indicating a potential error in the data source, the overall trend is clear.  Crucially, a comparison to analyst expectations for the most recent quarter (Q4 2024) is missing; without this comparison, evaluating the performance against expectations is impossible.

|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-07 | 0.7  | $11.59 B    |

**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

The profitability metrics (Revenue and Profit Margin) show a generally stable profit margin around 44-45%, despite a slight decline in revenue in recent quarters. ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, indicating variability in the efficiency of using shareholder investments.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the revenue decrease and ROE fluctuations is necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been underwhelming compared to the S&P 500.  While the company shows generally stable profitability, recent financial results indicate a decline in revenue and EPS.  Technical indicators provide a mixed signal, and the lack of analyst expectations and recent news makes it difficult to fully assess the current situation. The low expected return suggests that outperformance of the market is not anticipated, making the investment decision complex and dependent on a deeper analysis of the fundamental factors driving the recent downturn.  Further investigation into the causes of the revenue decline and comparative analysis with analyst expectations are critical for determining a sound investment strategy.
