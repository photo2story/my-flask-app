*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate has been highly variable, with strong positive growth in the 2017-2021 period but significant negative growth recently.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown is high across all periods, indicating significant price volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha, representing the excess return compared to the market, is largely negative, particularly in recent years, indicating underperformance relative to the market.  The negative alpha means Nike's returns haven't been as good as expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:** Beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, has fluctuated. Higher betas in recent years (2020-2024) suggest Nike's price movements have been more sensitive to market changes. The most recent beta is negative, suggesting an inverse correlation with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** This figure represents market capitalization in billions. It has decreased over the last few years, reflecting the stock's poor performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 60.93
*   **Previous Close:** 60.0
*   **Change:** 1.55
*   **5-day SMA:** 58.84
*   **20-day SMA:** 64.0485
*   **60-day SMA:** 65.1567
*   **Analysis:** The stock price is showing a recent positive movement (change of 1.55). However, the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend, but the overall trend based on longer-term moving averages remains downward.

**3) Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - This seems contradictory given other indicators.  It's important to understand the specific methodology of this MRI.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 38.69 - This is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), potentially indicating a possible buying opportunity.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.08 - Negative PPO suggests a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (25 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_0.41 Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01). This signal suggests a buying opportunity based on a "very safe" profile, but this contradicts other indicators and the expected return.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -5.8 (-) (단기하락) - Indicates a short-term decline.
*   **Price change significance:** The positive change from the previous close is significant, indicating a sharp rebound.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3820.2% - This is an extremely negative expected return, suggesting high risk and potential for further losses.
*   **Analysis:**  The indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests it might be oversold, the PPO and expected return indicate a continuing downtrend. The MRI contradicts the other indicators, and the "very safe" hybrid signal doesn't align with the fundamentals.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news headlines are a mix of positive and concerning points:
    *   Tim Cook's Nike stock purchase pushed the stock higher, indicating a potential short-term positive catalyst.
    *   Nike's potential is analyzed for 2026.
    *   Some articles mention that Nike stock is "crashing" and question whether it's a buying opportunity.
    *   Analysts are providing mixed signals, with one suggesting a cautious approach ("Lace Up, But Don’t Sprint").
*   **Analysis:** Recent news reflects some short-term positive sentiment driven by insider buying, but there are underlying concerns about Nike's performance and whether the current situation presents a true buying opportunity. The "crashing" narrative needs to be considered.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean of 1.92)
*   **Target Price:** 77.24 (average)
*   **Analysis:** Despite the recent poor performance, analysts generally have a "Buy" rating with an average target price of $77.24, significantly higher than the current price. This suggests analysts believe the stock is undervalued and has potential for recovery. However, it's important to note the wide range in target prices (35.00 - 120.00), indicating considerable uncertainty. The empty "Recent Rating Changes" section should be investigated to clarify whether or not there were changes.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출        |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-10-01 | 0.49 | 11.72 B$    |
| 2025-04-03 | 0.54 | 11.27 B$    |
| 2025-01-03 | 0.78 | 12.35 B$    |
| 2024-10-07 | 0.7  | 11.59 B$    |
| 2025-10-01 | 0.7  | 11.59 B$    |

*   **Analysis:** Examining the table, we can see a general downtrend in EPS (Earnings Per Share) from 2025-01-03 to 2025-10-01. Revenue (매출) has fluctuated but doesn't show a clear upward trend. This earnings trend likely contributes to the stock's underperformance. The duplicated row for "2025-10-01" should be verified for data accuracy.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| 2025-08-31   | $11.72B   | 42.18%         |
| 2025-05-31   | $11.10B   | 40.27%         |
| 2025-02-28   | $11.27B   | 41.49%         |
| 2024-11-30   | $12.35B   | 43.62%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-08-31   | $13.47B   | 5.40%     |
| 2025-05-31   | $13.21B   | 1.60%     |
| 2025-02-28   | $14.01B   | 5.67%     |
| 2024-11-30   | $14.04B   | 8.29%     |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has generally decreased since the quarter ending 2024-11-30. Profit margin has also shown a decline over the same period. Equity has remained relatively stable, but ROE (Return on Equity) has significantly decreased, indicating that the company is generating less profit from its equity. This reinforces the concerns about declining profitability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Summary:** Nike has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial divergence in returns. The recent stock price has shown a slight rebound, but longer-term moving averages suggest a downward trend. Indicators present a mixed picture, with some suggesting a potential oversold condition, while others indicate a continued downtrend. News headlines highlight short-term positive catalysts but also underlying concerns. Analyst consensus is generally "Buy," but there is a wide range in target prices. Recent earnings and financial data show a downtrend in EPS, revenue, profit margin, and ROE.
*   **Overall Assessment:** While there might be short-term opportunities due to the recent price rebound and potentially oversold conditions, the overall picture for Nike is concerning. Declining earnings, revenue, profitability, and ROE suggest fundamental challenges. The extremely negative expected return should be taken seriously. The analyst consensus should be viewed with caution, given the wide range in target prices.
*   **Recommendation:** A cautious approach is warranted. Further research is needed to understand the underlying causes of the declining performance and whether Nike has a viable plan to reverse the trend. It would be prudent to wait for more positive signs before considering a long-term investment. The conflicting signals from the MRI and Hybrid Signal should be critically examined.
