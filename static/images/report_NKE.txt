* **Closing Price:** $73.04
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $72.16
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.11

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price change of -$0.23 indicates a minor daily decline.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (43.57):**  Slightly below the neutral level of 50, indicating a slightly bearish sentiment, but not oversold.
* **PPO (-0.19):** Negative, suggesting bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+1.3):** Shows a recent short-term increase in relative strength, but this is counter to the overall negative trend.
* **Expected Return (-1065.3%):** This extremely negative value indicates a very pessimistic outlook for future returns relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This needs further investigation to understand the assumptions behind this projection.

**6.  Overall Conclusion:**

Nike's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500, with substantial underperformance in the last few years.  While past periods showed strong growth, current indicators – negative PPO, RSI below 50, price below moving averages, and an alarmingly negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 – suggest a bearish outlook. The provided data contains inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) that need clarification.  A thorough analysis requires additional data, especially regarding the extremely negative long-term expected return calculation (-1065.3%).  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the fundamentals of the company and the assumptions behind the provided projections is crucial.
