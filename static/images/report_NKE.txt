**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile alpha and beta values over the years.  The high beta values in recent years (2021-2025) suggest high sensitivity to market movements.  The negative alpha in 2023-2025 indicates underperformance relative to the market. The large fluctuations in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) highlight significant periods of both high growth and sharp declines. The consistent MDD (Maximum Drawdown) around 20% suggests significant risk.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 17.0% | 7.8% | -11.0% | 0.0 | 85.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 14.0% | 10.1% | -4.0% | 0.1 | 101.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 70.0% | 10.8% | 39.0% | 0.6 | 140.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 94.0% | 10.8% | 67.0% | 0.4 | 198.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 98.0% | 11.4% | 27.0% | 0.4 | 235.5 |

* **Closing Price:** $77.32
* **Previous Close:** $78.41
* **Change:** -$1.39 (a decline)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $79.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $75.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.13

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price drop of -$1.39 should be considered, but without further context (e.g., news, market events), its significance is limited.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.89 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning towards overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.35 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but weak)

* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -126.0% (This is a significant negative expected return; NKE is projected to underperform VOO considerably.)  Given this is based on past data, it should be interpreted cautiously.  A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) would require a reassessment of this figure based on future market conditions and company performance.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue. While the latest quarter shows a slight decrease in revenue compared to the previous quarter, overall, the revenue remains relatively stable.  There appears to be an error with the 2025-01-03 data entry, showing identical values to 2024-01-05.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2025-01-03 | 0.78 | $12.35B       |

| 2025-01-03 | 1.04 | $13.39B       | *(Duplicate Data)*


**5) Financial Information:**

The financial data shows generally stable revenue and high profit margins, though both have fluctuated over the last five quarters.  Equity has remained relatively consistent, while ROE (Return on Equity) has been variable, indicating inconsistency in profitability.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-11-30 | $12.35B | 43.62% |

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-11-30 | $14.04B | 8.29% |
| 2024-08-31 | $13.94B | 7.54% |
| 2024-05-31 | $14.43B | 10.40% |
| 2024-02-29 | $14.23B | 8.24% |
| 2023-11-30 | $14.15B | 11.16% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

NKE's recent performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500. While the company shows generally healthy financial metrics (high profit margins, stable revenue), the stock price is currently trading below its moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The high volatility highlighted in the alpha and beta analysis and the significantly negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 raise significant concerns.  A long-term investment strategy would need to consider these risks and carefully evaluate the company's future growth prospects in relation to the overall market performance.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the underperformance and analysis of future growth prospects are needed before making any investment decision.  The duplicated data points require clarification.
