## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Performance Review

**0. Executive Summary:** Nike Inc. (NKE), a leading designer and marketer of athletic footwear and apparel, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period.  The stock shows signs of distress, reflected in negative returns, low RSI, and negative PPO.  While recent earnings show some stability, the overall picture suggests a considerable risk.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Nike Inc. is a global sportswear giant, designing, developing, and marketing athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories.

* **NKE Cumulative Return:** -7.33%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 85.44%
* **Return Difference:** -92.8%  (This indicates NKE significantly underperformed VOO.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 7.6% (This places the current underperformance at the 7.6th percentile of historical divergence between NKE and VOO.)

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows a fluctuating relationship between NKE and the market (Beta).  While periods of outperformance (positive Alpha) occurred, the recent trend showcases significant underperformance, particularly in the 2021-2025 period.  The consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) also highlights significant risk.  The substantial market capitalization (Cap(B)) illustrates the considerable size and influence of Nike within the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $55.58
* **Previous Close:** $64.96
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $62.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $72.83

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The significant price drop of -$14.44 (Last-market) suggests a recent period of sharp decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 15.96 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce, but also indicating weakness)
* **PPO:** -1.66 (Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.8 (Short-term upward movement, but in a larger bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** -119.5% (This indicates a significant projected loss. This figure likely reflects the current market sentiment and the negative trend outlined in other data points.)  This extremely negative expected return should be interpreted cautiously and in the context of the other analyses. It is not a prediction of future performance but rather a reflection of the current market outlook.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NKE's recent performance is significantly below the S&P 500.  Technical indicators point to an oversold condition and bearish momentum.

Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price drop and the fluctuation in earnings and financial metrics is necessary before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment strategy may only be considered after a thorough risk assessment and a clear understanding of the company's challenges and prospects.  The high MDD values from the alpha/beta analysis further emphasize the volatility and risk associated with this stock.
