**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows a decline in recent periods, with negative growth in the last few years.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown is high across all periods, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, measuring performance relative to the market, is significantly negative in recent years, especially in 2022-2025 and 2023-2025, indicating substantial underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta indicates volatility relative to the market.  The Beta has been elevated, but recently dropped into negative territory, showing inverse relation to the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap has declined recently.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 60.93
*   **Last Market Change:** Price increased by 1.55 (from 60.00).
*   **5-day SMA:** 58.84
*   **20-day SMA:** 64.05
*   **60-day SMA:** 65.16

**Analysis:** The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which generally suggests a short-term downtrend. The recent price increase could signal a short-term bounce, but it needs to break above the 20-day SMA to confirm a trend reversal.

**3) Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended).  This is contradictory to the data and is suspect.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 38.69.  This suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory (below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity, but it's not definitive on its own.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.08. Negative PPO confirms recent downward momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (25 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_0.41 Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)". This signal suggests to purchase the stock.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -5.8 (Negative = short-term decline).  This confirms recent underperformance relative to the comparison benchmark.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -3820.2. This is an extremely negative figure, indicating a strong expectation of continued underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This number is highly suspect and needs further validation.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news headlines present a mixed picture. Some suggest caution ("Lace Up, But Don't Sprint"), while others point to potential recovery ("Nike: On A Long And Winding Road To Recovery").
*   **Negative Trends:**  Articles highlight the stock's losing streak and challenges in China.
*   **Positive Signals:** Tim Cook's stock purchase and Jim Cramer's positive view on the CEO offer some positive sentiment.
*   **China Sales Plunge:** The significant drop in shares due to declining China sales and tariff impacts is a major concern.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** "Buy" (Mean: 1.92).
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 77.24 / 120.00 / 35.00.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes.

**Analysis:** Despite the challenges, analysts generally maintain a "Buy" rating, suggesting potential for future growth. However, the wide range in target prices indicates uncertainty about the stock's future performance.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue        |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2025-10-01 | 0.49 | 11.72 B$       |

**Analysis:** The EPS has fluctuated, generally trending slightly downwards from early 2025, while revenue has also shown some variability. The most recent quarter has both the lowest EPS and the second highest revenue, which indicates issues with the costs impacting on profitability.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue has decreased slightly from the end of 2024.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have also declined slightly.
*   **Equity:** Equity is decreasing.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity has decreased significantly over the past year. This suggests a decline in profitability relative to shareholder equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Performance:** Nike has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. Its recent Alpha and Beta analysis paints a bleak picture of significant underperformance relative to the market.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The stock price is below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The RSI is approaching oversold, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, but more confirmation is needed.
*   **News & Events:**  The news is mixed, with some articles highlighting challenges (China sales plunge, tariff impacts) and others suggesting potential recovery.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** Analysts maintain a "Buy" rating, but the wide target price range reflects uncertainty.
*   **Financials:** While revenue remains substantial, both profit margins and ROE have declined, indicating potential issues with profitability.
*   **Warning Signs:**  Several indicators point to potential challenges. The China sales decline, negative divergence, decreasing Equity, and falling ROE are all red flags. The extremely negative Expected Return is highly concerning.

**Overall Recommendation:** Based on the data provided, a *cautious* approach is warranted. While analysts are generally positive, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, mixed news sentiment, and declining financial metrics suggest considerable risk. A potential investor should perform significantly more due diligence. The extremely negative "Expected Return" figure needs to be investigated and validated, as it could indicate a serious flaw in the underlying data or analysis.
