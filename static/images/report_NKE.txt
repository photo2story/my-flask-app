2025-02-19 - Analysis Report
## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

NKE's cumulative return is significantly below the S&P 500 (VOO) return.  The provided data shows a large negative divergence.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying reasons for this underperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Nike Inc. is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

* **NKE Cumulative Return:** -1.61%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 121.84%
* **Return Difference:** -123.45% (NKE significantly underperformed VOO)
* **Relative Divergence:** 1.3 (Near the lower end of the historical range, indicating significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500)

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows a high degree of variability in performance and beta over the years. The recent years (2021-2025) show significantly negative CAGR and high negative Alpha, suggesting substantial underperformance compared to the market.  The high negative CAGR in recent years is concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $73.04
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $72.16
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.11

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.57 (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting slightly bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.19 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.3 (Short-term upward movement, but in the context of significant negative overall divergence, this is minor)
* **Expected Return:** -1065.3% (This extremely negative figure suggests a very pessimistic outlook.  It is critical to understand the methodology and assumptions behind this calculation.)  This drastically negative figure needs further investigation to confirm its validity and underlying assumptions.  A -1065.3% expected return is practically impossible in a realistic investment scenario.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2025-01-03 | $0.78 | $12.35 Billion |
| 2024-10-07 | $0.70 | $11.59 Billion |
| 2024-04-04 | $0.77 | $12.43 Billion |
| 2024-01-05 | $1.04 | $13.39 Billion |
| 2023-10-26 | $1.04  | $13.39 Billion |


Earnings show some volatility, with a decline in EPS and revenue in Q4 2024.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons for this fluctuation.  The repetition of the 2025-01-03 data point needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of total revenue and gross profit data prevents a thorough financial analysis. This missing data is a significant limitation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

NKE has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period reviewed.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  Recent earnings show some volatility and a potential decline in Q4 2024. The extremely negative expected return (-1065.3%) requires further investigation and clarification of the methodology used for calculation. The absence of key financial data (Total Revenue and Gross Profit) severely limits the overall analysis. More comprehensive financial data is necessary for a more robust assessment of Nike's current financial health and future prospects.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind NKE's underperformance and the validity of the highly negative expected return figure.  The data provided indicates a high-risk investment at present.
