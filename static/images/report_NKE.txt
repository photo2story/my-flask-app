## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Performance Review

**0. Overview:**

Nike, Inc. is a multinational corporation engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and worldwide marketing and sales of footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Nike's cumulative return is significantly below that of the S&P 500.

* **NKE Cumulative Return:** -4.90%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 89.44%
* **Return Difference:** -94.3% (This represents the underperformance of NKE compared to VOO.  The relative divergence of -94.3% places it at the 6.7th percentile of the historical range of divergence between NKE and VOO, indicating substantial underperformance.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed results. While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been positive in most periods, the recent years show substantial negative returns (-51%, -99%, -81%).  Alpha, which measures excess return compared to the market, has been mostly positive in recent years, suggesting that NKE outperformed the market during those periods despite the overall negative trend. However, the high Beta values (particularly in the last few periods) show high sensitivity to market fluctuations, amplifying both positive and negative movements.  The high Beta and declining CAGR indicate substantial market risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $64.76
* **Last Market Price:** $64.67 (Slight decrease of -$0.15)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $64.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $70.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $73.23

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 22.37 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce but not necessarily a strong upward trend.)
* **PPO:** -1.27 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.6 (Short-term upward movement, but context is limited without further historical data.)
* **Expected Return:** -133.1% (This extremely negative figure suggests that there is substantial risk of further losses compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, exceeding the risk level that an index tracker would present.  This needs further investigation and context to interpret fully).  The extremely low price relative to recent highs, and negative market sentiment indicated by the technical indicators, could warrant caution before taking this forecast as indicative of actual future performance.

The small negative price change of -$0.15 does not suggest a significant event (no 급반등 or 급하락).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-01-03 | $0.78  | $12.35 B      |
| 2024-10-07 | $0.70  | $11.59 B      |

Earnings show some volatility.  There's a noticeable drop in EPS from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024, followed by a modest recovery, which then declines into the final quarter again.  Revenue also fluctuates but remains relatively stable around the $12B mark,  except for a Q1 2024 peak. The repetition of the 2025-01-03 entry suggests a potential data entry error.  Further investigation is needed to ascertain if this is a genuine report or if there are errors in the data.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's current performance is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500. While the company maintains healthy profit margins, recent negative returns and high beta indicate substantial market risk. Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the overall trend remains bearish.  The provided -133.1% expected return should be treated with extreme caution due to the lack of context and significant negative bias.  Earnings data shows some volatility, requiring further analysis to determine underlying trends.  Before making any investment decisions, further research is strongly recommended to validate the data provided and investigate potential underlying reasons for NKE's underperformance.  The presence of apparent data errors further highlights this need for additional validation.
