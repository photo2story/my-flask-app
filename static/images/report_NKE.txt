## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Nike Inc. is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

The provided data shows a significant underperformance of NKE compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  While VOO had a cumulative return of 119.94%, NKE's cumulative return was only 3.19%. This represents a substantial divergence of -116.8 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 3.1% indicates NKE's performance is at the lower end of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  The Alpha consistently remains around 0.1, suggesting minimal outperformance compared to the market benchmark, while Beta values show varying levels of market sensitivity.  The high negative CAGR values in recent years (-60%, -110%, -72%) are alarming and require further investigation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $76.58
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $74.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.62

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 60-day moving average indicates the recent price increase might not be overly sustained.  The positive change from the previous close ($2.94) suggests a recent price jump.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.75 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.83 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -375.2% (This is a highly negative figure and needs clarification.  It's crucial to understand the calculation method and assumptions behind this prediction.  It likely represents a potential significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon.)

The combination of high RSI and positive PPO indicates bullish momentum, but the RSI is approaching overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term correction. The large positive change from the previous close supports the notion of a recent price jump, but the extremely negative expected return raises serious concerns.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While there's a general upward trend in revenue, EPS fluctuates.  The data also contains a duplicate entry for 2025-01-03, which needs clarification.  A more thorough analysis would require a longer time series and deeper examination of the underlying business factors.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2025-01-03 | 0.78 | $12.35B      |

| 2025-01-03 | 1.04 | $13.39B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows relatively stable revenue and profit margins, although there's a slight downward trend in recent quarters.  Equity fluctuates slightly, and the Return on Equity (ROE) also shows some variability, indicating potential shifts in the company's profitability.  Further analysis is needed to understand these fluctuations and their implications.

| Quarter    | Revenue     | Profit Margin | Equity    | ROE     |
|------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-11-30 | $12.35B     | 43.62%        | $14.04B   | 8.29%   |
| 2024-08-31 | $11.59B     | 45.36%        | $13.94B   | 7.54%   |
| 2024-05-31 | $12.61B     | 44.69%        | $14.43B   | 10.40%  |
| 2024-02-29 | $12.43B     | 44.75%        | $14.23B   | 8.24%   |
| 2023-11-30 | $13.39B     | 44.60%        | $14.15B   | 11.16%  |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NKE's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500, indicated by its substantial negative divergence.  While short-term indicators suggest some bullish momentum, the extremely negative long-term expected return and recent negative CAGR figures raise significant concerns.  Further investigation is crucial to understand the reasons behind this underperformance.  The conflicting signals from the technical indicators and the drastically negative long-term expected return require a more in-depth fundamental analysis to assess the true investment risk and potential reward.  The inconsistent earnings data and fluctuating financial metrics also require additional scrutiny.  A complete analysis should incorporate qualitative factors such as competitive landscape, macroeconomic conditions, and management decisions.  The -375.2% expected return is highly unusual and requires clarification as to its derivation.


**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the data provided, a cautious approach is recommended. The significant underperformance relative to the market, the inconsistent financial results, and the extremely negative long-term return projection raise serious red flags. Before making any investment decisions, conduct thorough due diligence, including a comprehensive fundamental analysis and evaluation of the company's future growth prospects. Verify the source and calculation method of the -375.2% expected return. This figure requires further clarification and context before making any investment decisions based on this number.
