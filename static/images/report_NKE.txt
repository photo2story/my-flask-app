**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $55.76
* **5-day Moving Average:** $54.79
* **20-day Moving Average:** $59.96
* **60-day Moving Average:** $70.15

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price change of +4.13% indicates a recent price bounce after a likely period of decline.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.51 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.34 (Bearish signal)
* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** +1.5 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -168.8% (This extremely negative figure requires further investigation and clarification. It likely reflects an outlier result from a specific calculation, possibly tied to model assumptions or the current market environment.)

The combination of a low RSI, negative PPO, and the price being below its moving averages suggests a bearish outlook in the short term.  However, the recent price increase and positive relative strength change hint at potential short-term recovery.  The extraordinarily negative expected return warrants careful scrutiny.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2025-04-03 | $0.54 | $11.27B        |
| 2025-01-03 | $0.78 | $12.35B        |
| 2024-10-07 | $0.70 | $11.59B        |
| 2024-04-04 | $0.77 | $12.43B        |
| 2025-04-03 | $0.77 | $12.43B        | *(Duplicate entry - likely a data error)*


Revenue shows some volatility, but generally remains strong.  EPS is inconsistent, declining in Q1 2025.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying causes of this variability. Duplicate data entry suggests the need for data verification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2025-02-28 | $11.27B    | 41.49%        |
| 2024-11-30 | $12.35B    | 43.62%        |

| 2024-02-29 | $12.43B    | 44.75%        |

Profit margins are consistently high, though showing a slight downward trend. Revenue is relatively stable but exhibits fluctuations.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE     |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2025-02-28 | $14.01B    | 5.67%   |
| 2024-11-30 | $14.04B    | 8.29%   |
| 2024-08-31 | $13.94B    | 7.54%   |

| 2024-02-29 | $14.23B    | 8.24%   |


Equity is generally stable, while ROE fluctuates but generally remains healthy.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NKE's recent performance significantly lags the S&P 500. While past data reveals periods of substantial growth, current indicators (low RSI, negative PPO, price below moving averages) point towards a bearish short-term outlook. However, the recent price bounce and positive relative strength change suggest potential for short-term recovery.  The provided "Expected Return" of -168.8% is highly unusual and needs further investigation to determine its validity. Earnings data shows some inconsistencies requiring further analysis to assess future prospects.  Fundamental indicators like profit margin and ROE remain robust. A long-term investment strategy might be considered, but only after careful consideration of the company's current challenges and future growth prospects.  Data inconsistencies require clarification and validation before drawing strong conclusions.
