## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Nike Inc. (NKE) is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

The cumulative return of NKE is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a cumulative return of -4.06% for NKE and 112.20% for VOO. This represents a substantial divergence of -116.3%, placing it at the 2.2nd percentile of the historical divergence range (-120.6% to 73.9%).  The significant underperformance is evident.

The provided alpha and beta analysis indicates varying performance across different periods. While some periods show high CAGR and positive alpha, recent years (2021-2025) exhibit substantial negative returns and a deteriorating CAGR.  The consistent beta near 0.1 suggests relatively low sensitivity to overall market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $71.20
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $75.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $77.02

The stock is trading below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the 5-day average suggests recent price stability, despite the overall downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 17.17 (Extremely oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.75 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-)  This suggests a consistent downward trend in the recent period.
* **Expected Return:** -453.4%  This extremely negative expected return raises significant concerns and likely reflects the current bearish sentiment and the historical underperformance against the S&P 500.  This figure should be treated with extreme caution, as such a drastic negative return is unlikely in a long-term investment scenario.  Instead of focusing on a numerical prediction, a more appropriate approach would be to assess the long-term potential of NKE given its current valuation and the broader market conditions.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS and revenue data show some fluctuation. While there's a peak in Q1 2024, subsequent quarters show a slight decline in EPS and revenue.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind these fluctuations and whether they represent a trend.  The duplication of the 2025-01-03 entry warrants investigation. Data inconsistencies need to be resolved before meaningful analysis is possible.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals stable but slightly declining revenues in recent quarters. Profit margins remain consistently high (around 44-45%), indicating strong profitability.  ROE also fluctuates, suggesting some volatility in return on equity.  More comprehensive analysis (including detailed financial statements) would be required to make fully informed judgements on financial health.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NKE has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years.  Technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) point towards a bearish trend. While the company maintains strong profitability margins, recent earnings show some weakness.  The extremely negative expected return projection highlights significant risk. Further in-depth fundamental and technical analysis is crucial to determine the appropriateness of investing in NKE.  A thorough review of the company's strategic plans, competitive landscape, and broader macroeconomic conditions is necessary to assess the long-term potential and associated risks.  The extreme negative predicted return should not be considered reliable, instead a thorough risk assessment is necessary before making any investment decision.  The data inconsistencies need to be clarified before any further analysis can be conducted.
