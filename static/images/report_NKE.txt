* **20-Day Moving Average:** 73.13

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 12.36 (Significantly oversold, indicating potential for a bounce, but also high risk)
* **PPO:** -1.45 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -1.2 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -148.5% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term warrants careful consideration. This suggests significantly underperformance compared to the broader market.)

The sharp price drop (if the data for `{'price': 63.12, 'previousClose': 63.29, 'change': -0.27}` were larger) would be considered a significant event warranting further investigation into potential underlying causes.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the broader market, as reflected in the large negative alpha and the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While the company shows strong revenue and profit margins, the stock price displays a clear downtrend supported by technical indicators suggesting bearish momentum. The extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500, and the high beta, indicate high risk.  A potential long-term investment should be made cautiously, with a thorough understanding of the underlying risks and a long-term perspective.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance is recommended before any investment decision.  The duplicated data point needs clarification.
