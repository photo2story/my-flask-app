**8. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  While historical data shows periods of strong growth, recent quarters have shown declining revenue and EPS, resulting in considerable underperformance.  Technical indicators suggest a potential downtrend, but the RSI approaching oversold levels might indicate a short-term bounce.  However, the negative PPO and substantial relative divergence suggest continued bearish momentum.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the declining financial performance and a thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions are critical before making any investment decisions.  The currently projected long-term return does not show outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this is predicated on current trends continuing.
