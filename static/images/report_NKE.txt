*   **CAGR:**  Recent periods show negative CAGR, indicating poor growth in recent years.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values suggest significant price volatility and potential risk.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha in recent periods means Nike has underperformed its benchmark (risk-adjusted basis).
*   **Beta:** Fluctuating Beta indicates varying sensitivity to market movements.  The negative beta for the 2023-2025 period is an outlier.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has declined, reflecting investor concerns.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** \$70.89
*   **Last Market Close:** \$71.28 (Previous Close: \$70.89, Change: \$0.55 - A slight uptick)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** \$72.91
*   **20-day Moving Average:** \$75.50
*   **60-day Moving Average:** \$74.16

**Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The slight increase in the last market close doesn't negate the overall downward momentum.

### 3. Indicators and Signals

*   **RSI:** 14.60 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.86

*   **Delta Previous Relative Divergence (20-day):** 0.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -2618.0% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Indicates a low-risk market environment *generally*, but this doesn't reflect Nike's specific situation.
*   **RSI:**  The RSI signals an *oversold* condition, which *could* indicate a potential for a rebound, but should be considered cautiously.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The algorithm recommends selling a small portion of holdings and increasing cash position to 70%, indicating a cautious outlook.
*   **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** Confirms the recent short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is concerning and suggests that, based on the data and model, Nike is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term.
*   **Last Market Close Change:** Given the recent increase of 0.55, this suggests a slight rebound, however, the other indicators mentioned may suggest this may not last.

### 4. Recent News & Events

**Analysis:**  Despite the negative indicators, analysts, on average, still rate Nike as a "Buy" and predict an average target price above the current market price.  However, the wide range in target prices (from \$38 to \$120) indicates considerable uncertainty.
