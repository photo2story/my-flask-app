*   **Analysis:** Revenue shows some seasonal fluctuation. Profit margins are solid but have decreased slightly from the end of 2024. ROE has also declined, suggesting a less efficient use of equity to generate profits.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Nike is currently underperforming the broader market. The recent stock price movement shows some positive signs, potentially driven by insider buying and contrarian investment sentiment. However, longer-term financial indicators such as Alpha, Expected Returns, and ROE suggest challenges in generating returns and outperforming the market. Analyst consensus remains positive. The high MRI and Hybrid Signal could indicate an appropriate entry point for high-risk, contrarian investors, but further research is needed to determine whether Nike can reverse its recent negative trends.
