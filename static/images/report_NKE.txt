**1. Performance Comparison and Company Overview:**

Nike Inc. (NKE) is a leading designer, developer, and marketer of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories worldwide.

NKE's cumulative return of 3.62% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 119.91%.  The -116.3% difference highlights substantial underperformance.  The relative strength index of 3.4 suggests recent outperformance,  but this is only a short term observation.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta data show highly variable performance relative to the market (beta) and significant swings in outperformance or underperformance (alpha). Notably, the last three years show dramatically negative CAGR, suggesting substantial challenges for NKE during this period.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 17.0% | 7.7% | -11.0% | 0.0 | 85.5 |
| 2016-2018  | 14.0% | 10.1% | -4.0% | 0.1 | 102.5 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

NKE's closing price is $76.90, down $1.83 from the previous close.  The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average ($76.36), above the 20-day moving average ($73.33), but slightly below the 60-day moving average ($75.63). This suggests some short-term bullish momentum, but longer-term trends are less clear.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (69.08):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70).  Suggests potential for a short-term pullback.
* **PPO (1.02):** Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Relative Strength:** The recent short-term upward trend (+3.4) is notable, but needs to be viewed in light of the significant longer-term underperformance.
* **Expected Return (-349.4%):**  A highly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 indicates significant risk and low projected growth over the long term (2+ years). This dramatic negative return is a serious red flag.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data show some variability in EPS and revenue. There seems to be a downward trend towards the end of 2024, which might be influencing the recent stock price underperformance.  More context and analysis are needed to fully assess this trend.

|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-01-03 | 0.78 | $12.35 B      |

| 2025-01-03 | 1.04 | $13.39 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-11-30  | $12.35B    | 43.62%        |
| 2024-08-31  | $11.59B    | 45.36%        |
| 2024-05-31  | $12.61B    | 44.69%        |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NKE's recent performance is concerning. While some short-term indicators suggest a potential upward trend, the long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is significant (-116.3% difference), and the projected long-term return is dramatically negative.   The variability in alpha and beta, along with the recent decline in some key financial metrics, raises concerns about the company's future prospects.  A deeper dive into the reasons for this underperformance – including competitive pressures, macroeconomic factors, and NKE's specific strategic decisions – is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The exceptionally negative projected return (-349.4%) strongly suggests that, based on the provided data, investing in NKE might be exceptionally risky compared to simply investing in the S&P 500.
