**6) Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  While historical data shows periods of strong growth, current indicators point to a bearish trend.  Technical indicators (low RSI, negative PPO) suggest potential for further decline, though the recent price increase hints at a possible short-term rebound.  Earnings show volatility, and financial data reveals mixed profitability signals. The exceptionally negative expected return highlights significant long-term underperformance risk relative to the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the reasons for declining revenue and fluctuating profitability is warranted before making any investment decisions.  The data provided requires further contextualization and deeper analysis to draw more definitive conclusions.
