**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $70.94
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $72.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.34

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price increase (+$3.29) from the previous close should be noted, but within the context of the larger downtrend, it doesn't signal a significant reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 44.73 – Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.58 – Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -3.6 – Shows a recent short-term price decline.
* **Expected Return:** -1330.7% – This extremely negative value suggests a significantly negative outlook relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), requiring further investigation into its calculation methodology.  It's likely an error or reflects a highly pessimistic scenario.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |

There's a noticeable decline in EPS and Revenue from Q1 2024 ($1.04, $13.39B) to Q4 2024 ($0.70, $11.59B), suggesting a weakening in the company's financial performance. The duplicate entry for 2025-01-03 needs clarification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NKE is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  While some technical indicators suggest potential oversold conditions, the substantial negative divergence and negative expected return (assuming the -1330.7% is an error or a highly unlikely worst-case scenario), along with a decline in recent earnings, paint a concerning picture. Further investigation is needed to understand the causes of this underperformance.  Factors such as macroeconomic conditions, competitive pressures, and internal company issues should be explored.  The drastically negative expected return needs clarification.  Before making any investment decisions, a more thorough fundamental and qualitative analysis of NKE's business is recommended.
