### 7. 종합 분석

Nike(NKE)는 S&P 500에 비해 실적이 매우 저조하며 최근 몇 년 동안 실적이 좋지 않아 CAGR이 마이너스입니다. 기술 지표는 여전히 하락세인 가격과 혼합된 신호를 제공하며, 극도로 부정적인 예상 수익률은 장기적으로 비관적인 전망을 의미합니다. 그러나 애널리스트들은 평균적으로 매수 포지션을 유지하며 가격 인상을 예상하고 있지만 목표 가격 범위가 넓어 불확실성이 있음을 알 수 있습니다. 최근 수익은 변동성이 심하며, 수익 마진과 ROE는 하락세에 있으며 이는 문제가 되고 있습니다. 관세에 대한 우려는 단기 전망을 더욱 압박할 가능성이 있습니다. 하이브리드 신호와 애널리스트의 합의에도 불구하고 재무적 약점과 시장 성과 저조에 대한 경고가 있습니다.

**Summary:**

Nike (NKE) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with negative CAGR in recent years, demonstrating poor performance. Technical indicators offer mixed signals with a still-declining price, and the extremely negative expected return signifies a pessimistic outlook in the long run. However, analysts on average maintain a buy position and expect a price increase, but there is uncertainty as shown by the large target price range. Recent earnings have been volatile, and profit margins and ROE are in decline, which are problematic. Concerns about tariffs may further pressure the short-term outlook. Despite hybrid signals and analyst consensus, there is caution due to financial weakness and poor market performance.
