**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been significantly weak compared to the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, and the extremely negative expected return is a major concern requiring further investigation to validate. While historical data shows periods of strong performance, recent quarters demonstrate some weakening in revenue and profitability trends.  The -165.7% expected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism, as it likely reflects recent extreme underperformance. A thorough assessment requires more comprehensive data and analysis, including a review of macroeconomic factors, industry trends, and Nike's specific competitive landscape and strategic initiatives.  Before any investment decisions are made, a deeper dive into the reasons for the recent underperformance is crucial.  The provided data is insufficient to make informed long-term investment recommendations.
