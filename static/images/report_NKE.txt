The recent price increase, reflected in the `Last-market` data, shows a positive change of 3.29%, suggesting a potential short-term bounce. However, this needs to be viewed in the context of the longer-term negative trends.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 36.42 (Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so.)

* **Expected Return:** -1113.8% (This exceptionally negative expected return over the long term relative to the S&P 500 is a significant red flag and needs further investigation.  The methodology for calculating this figure requires clarification).  The large price change in `Last-market`  suggests recent volatility but doesn't override the long-term negative outlook indicated by this metric.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NKE's stock performance significantly lags behind the S&P 500, showing a substantial negative divergence. While the company maintains high profit margins and a relatively stable revenue stream, the recent negative CAGR and the extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the market raise serious concerns.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition, but this needs to be considered in the context of the overall bearish trend.  The provided earnings and financial data requires further cleaning and analysis to gain clearer insights into the company's financial health and future prospects.  The -1113.8% expected return is highly unusual and warrants further investigation into its calculation methodology.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough review of additional financial statements, industry comparisons, and future projections is strongly advised.  The data provided suggests a high-risk investment at present.
