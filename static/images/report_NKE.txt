**Analysis:** The MRI suggests low market risk. The RSI of 67.46 indicates that the stock is nearing overbought conditions. A positive PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating a positive trend, but should be interpreted with caution given that the short term trend is declining. The recent downward change in relative deviation reinforces the indication of recent negative momentum. The extremely negative expected return suggests that the model predicts continued underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The fact that the price is down slightly from the previous close, suggests that the market is not heavily impacted by any news.
