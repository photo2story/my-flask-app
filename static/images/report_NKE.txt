**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NKE has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  Technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, though a recent short-term upward movement is observable.  Earnings data shows some volatility and a recent decline. The lack of comprehensive financial data and the presence of errors in the provided dataset hinder a thorough analysis.  The extremely negative expected return (-1065.3%) is likely an error and should be disregarded.  Further investigation and more reliable data are necessary for a robust assessment of NKE's future prospects.  A long-term investment strategy, even with a long-term horizon, should carefully consider the current underperformance and the volatility shown in the data.
