* **PPO (-2.07):** Shows a strong bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength (20-Day Change):** A positive 6.4% change suggests recent short-term upward momentum; however, this is likely a temporary correction in a broader downtrend considering the moving averages.
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):**  At 0.43, the MRI suggests a medium risk level.
* **Expected Return:** The projected -125.6% long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is exceptionally negative, highlighting significant concerns about future performance.  This necessitates a careful evaluation of the underlying reasons for this prediction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

NKE's recent performance is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500.  While some technical indicators (RSI) suggest potential for a short-term bounce, the overall trend appears bearish, supported by the negative PPO, significantly lower price compared to moving averages, and a very negative long-term return projection. The high Beta in recent years suggests higher-than-market volatility.  Earnings data shows some fluctuation, and further analysis is required to understand the drivers behind recent performance. The extremely negative expected return (-125.6%) requires further investigation and consideration of potential underlying risks before making any investment decisions.  A deeper dive into macroeconomic factors, industry trends, and company-specific news would be crucial for a more complete assessment.
