## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Nike Inc. (NKE) is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

The cumulative return for NKE is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is -117.8 percentage points.  This places NKE at the 0.3 percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, indicating substantial underperformance. The provided alpha consistently shows a small positive value, suggesting only marginal outperformance relative to the market benchmark. However, the beta is consistently high, showing a significant correlation with market movements. The drastic drop in CAGR from 2019-2021 to 2021-2023 and further to 2022-2024 indicates a significant decline in performance.  The high and increasing Maximum Drawdown (MDD) further illustrates the risk associated with this investment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $77.20
* **Last Market Price:** $78.50
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $77.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $77.23
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $79.50

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term weakness.  However, it's notably below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend. The last market price of $78.50 suggests a potential minor bounce, but further observation is needed to confirm any significant upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (42.23):** Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (0.056):** A slightly positive PPO suggests a potential upward momentum, though it's relatively weak.
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence (-0.7):** This indicates a recent short-term bearish trend.

Considering the last market price of $78.50 is slightly higher than the closing price, there might be a minor upward movement. There's no significant indication of a sharp rebound or decline based solely on these indicators. The expected return is 0.0%, suggesting that at current valuations and based on past S&P 500 performance relative to NKE, long-term investment (2+ years) might not significantly outperform the benchmark.
