## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Nike Inc. is a multinational corporation that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

The cumulative return of NKE (-4.09%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.74%.  The provided data shows a substantial divergence of -116.8%, placing it at the 2nd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a considerable underperformance compared to the broader market.  The Alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting marginal outperformance compared to the market, but the Beta significantly varies across the years.  The high volatility in the CAGR and MDD illustrates significant risk and unpredictable performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $71.17
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $74.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $76.66

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The relatively small gap between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates some recent consolidation, but the considerable distance from the 60-day average points towards a potentially persistent bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 21.46 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound, but it's also crucial to consider the broader context of underperformance.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.5753 – A negative PPO further confirms the bearish trend.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +2.0 (short-term upward movement) – This suggests a minor short-term price increase but doesn't necessarily contradict the overall bearish trend highlighted by other indicators.
* **Expected Return:** -515.2% – This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a significant concern, requiring careful consideration.  This is likely an error in the provided data.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent, with duplicate entries for 2025-01-03.  Assuming these are errors and taking the unique data points:

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-07 | $0.70 | $11.59B     |
| 2024-04-04 | $0.77 | $12.43B     |
| 2024-01-05 | $1.04 | $13.39B     |


Earnings show some fluctuation, with a notable dip in EPS in Q4 2024.  A more complete and consistent dataset is needed for thorough analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuation, while profit margins remain consistently high (around 44-45%), demonstrating strong profitability despite revenue variations.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable, while ROE fluctuates, indicating variations in the efficiency of capital utilization.  A downward trend in ROE might be a cause for concern.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  Technical indicators point towards an oversold condition, which might suggest a potential short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook appears bearish. The negative expected return (assuming the provided -515.2% is erroneous) and the considerable divergence from the S&P 500 raises serious concerns. While profitability margins remain high, fluctuating revenue and a potentially downward-trending ROE warrant careful attention.  More detailed and consistent financial data is needed for a more comprehensive assessment.  Further investigation into the causes of underperformance is crucial before making any investment decisions. The seemingly erroneous -515.2% expected return requires clarification and correction.
