**0) Executive Summary:**

Nike Inc. (NKE), a leading designer, developer, and marketer of athletic footwear, apparel, and equipment, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the review period.  While exhibiting periods of strong growth, recent performance has been weak, leading to a substantial negative return compared to the benchmark.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes and the outlook for future performance.


**1) Performance Comparison:**

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 20.0% | 58.9% | -13.0% | 0.0 | 84.9 |

| 2017-2019  | 60.0% | 12.6% | 27.0% | 0.6 | 140.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 71.0% | 59.7% | 41.0% | 1.0 | 198.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 79.0% | 59.7% | 19.0% | 1.1 | 235.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 1.0% | 73.8% | -8.0% | 1.2 | 166.8 |
| 2021-2023  | -36.0% | 73.8% | -57.0% | 1.3 | 156.8 |
| 2022-2024  | -80.0% | 73.8% | -100.0% | 1.6 | 111.1 |
| 2023-2025  | -70.0% | 83.7% | 0.1 | 0.1 | 84.7 |


The data shows significant volatility in NKE's performance, with periods of high CAGR followed by sharp declines.  The beta fluctuates, suggesting varying sensitivity to market movements.  The negative alpha in several periods indicates underperformance relative to the market.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $57.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $55.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $58.40
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $69.29

The closing price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price increase from the previous close (+$0.58) could be a short-term bounce.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 38.44 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** 0.76 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but needs further context).
* **Recent Relative Strength Change:** +0.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -198.7% (This extremely negative value needs further clarification and context. It's likely an error or requires significant additional information to interpret correctly.)

The RSI suggests the stock may be oversold, potentially signaling a short-term rebound. However, the significantly negative expected return requires further investigation.  The small positive change in relative strength supports the interpretation that the increase of 0.58 from the previous close could indicate a temporary bounce and not a significant upward trend.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2025-04-03 | $0.54 | $11.27B      |
| 2025-01-03 | $0.78 | $12.35B      |

| 2025-04-03 | $0.77 | $12.43B      | *(Note: Duplicate entry?)*


There's a noticeable fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  A clear trend is difficult to discern from this limited data, and a duplicate entry on 2025-04-03 needs clarification. More data is needed for robust analysis.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance is concerning, exhibiting substantial underperformance against the S&P 500. While historical data shows periods of strong growth, recent results reveal significant volatility and negative returns.  Technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain given the negative expected return (which requires further clarification).  Earnings data shows fluctuation, and while profit margins remain strong, a downward trend is apparent in both revenue and ROE.  More comprehensive data and a deeper dive into the factors influencing NKE's performance are needed to form a definitive conclusion.  The extremely negative expected return figure requires critical review and correction before drawing conclusions about its implications.
