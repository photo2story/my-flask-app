| Date | EPS | Revenue |
|---|---|---|

**Analysis:**  The most recent earnings report (2024-04-04) revealed a slight decline in both EPS and revenue compared to the previous quarter.  While the revenue exceeded analyst estimates, the EPS missed expectations. This could have contributed to the recent dip in the stock price. 

**5. Overall Analysis:**

NKE currently shows signs of weakness in the short term. The stock has significantly underperformed the market and is trading below key moving averages. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions and a potential short-term downtrend. However, the positive expected return indicates a potential upside in the longer term. The recent earnings report missed expectations which could contribute to the downward trend.

**6. Conclusion:** 

While NKE has faced challenges recently, investors should consider the long-term potential of the company. The brand remains strong and the expected return indicates a potential upside. However, it is crucial to monitor the stock closely for signs of a turnaround. Investors should also consider factors like consumer spending, competition, and global macroeconomic conditions before making any investment decisions.
