**6. Overall Analysis:**

NKE's recent performance has been volatile, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 over the period examined. While some periods show substantial outperformance (driven by positive Alpha), recent years show consistent underperformance and high Beta, indicating sensitivity to market movements. Technical indicators suggest a possible short-term uptrend, but the RSI is approaching overbought territory.  The exceptionally negative long-term expected return (-116.1%) is a major red flag, suggesting considerable risk.  Further investigation into the drivers of recent underperformance (e.g., macroeconomic factors, competition, changes in consumer preferences) is needed before any investment decision can be made.  The duplicated earnings data requires clarification.  Careful consideration of the risks associated with this stock is essential.
