**Analysis:**  Despite the current negative indicators, analysts still have a generally positive outlook on NKE, with a "Buy" consensus and a target price above the current price. However, the wide range in target prices ($38-$120) reflects significant uncertainty. The absence of recent rating changes could indicate that analysts are still digesting recent performance.

A further decline in price may present a buying opportunity for long-term investors, but only after clear signs of a turnaround are evident. The extremely low expected return should be verified and understood before making any investment decisions.
