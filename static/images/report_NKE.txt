## Nike Inc. (NKE) Stock Performance Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Nike Inc. (NKE), a leading designer and marketer of athletic footwear and apparel, shows significantly underperformed compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, exhibiting substantial negative returns. While recent financial statements suggest healthy profitability, the stock's negative momentum and valuation metrics raise concerns. A detailed analysis follows.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Nike Inc. is a multinational corporation designing, developing, and manufacturing athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services.

* **Cumulative Return (NKE):** -13.25%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 66.94%
* **Return Difference:** -80.2%  (NKE underperformed VOO by 80.2 percentage points)
* **Relative Divergence:** 10.6% (This places NKE's underperformance in the lower 10th percentile of historical relative performance compared to VOO based on the provided minimum and maximum divergence values.  This suggests the current underperformance is relatively extreme historically.)


The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), MDD (Maximum Drawdown), Alpha, and Beta data reveal a volatile performance relative to the market (Beta > 1 in recent years).  While periods of strong outperformance (high CAGR and positive Alpha) existed, recent years (2021-2025) have shown significant negative CAGR and increasingly negative Alpha, indicating substantial underperformance against the market benchmark. The high Beta consistently suggests substantial market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $59.32
* **5-day Moving Average:** $56.21
* **20-day Moving Average:** $65.35
* **60-day Moving Average:** $71.83

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent significant price increase (11.36% from the previous close) could signal a temporary bounce or the start of a reversal. However, the fact it remains significantly below the longer-term moving averages indicates potential for further downside.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 30.06 (Oversold, but caution needed due to other factors)
* **PPO:** -1.53 (Bearish signal)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +4.1% (Short-term upward momentum, but not necessarily indicative of longer-term trend reversal.)
* **Expected Return:** -158.2% (This extremely negative value is concerning and requires careful consideration. It suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the longer term. The extremely negative value may need to be validated. Further investigation into the methodology is needed).

The combination of high market risk, oversold RSI, negative PPO, and significantly negative expected return paint a bearish picture.  The recent price surge needs to be viewed within the broader context of negative trends and a high risk assessment.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-04-03 | $0.54  | $11.27B       |
| 2025-01-03 | $0.78  | $12.35B       |

There is a noticeable decline in both EPS and revenue in the most recent quarter (2025-04-03).  Further analysis is needed to determine the causes of this dip and whether it represents a significant trend change.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2025-02-28  | $11.27B     | 41.49%        |
| 2024-11-30  | $12.35B     | 43.62%        |
| 2024-08-31  | $11.59B     | 45.36%        |
| 2024-05-31  | $12.61B     | 44.69%        |
| 2024-02-29  | $12.43B     | 44.75%        |

Profit margins remain relatively healthy, though there's some fluctuation.  The recent decline in revenue warrants further investigation.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE           |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2025-02-28  | $14.01B     | 5.67%         |
| 2024-11-30  | $14.04B     | 8.29%         |

| 2024-02-29  | $14.23B     | 8.24%         |

ROE (Return on Equity) also shows some fluctuation but remains generally positive.  The slight decrease in equity in the most recent period warrants closer examination.



**6. Overall Analysis:**

Nike's recent performance has been significantly underwhelming compared to the S&P 500.  While its fundamentals (profit margins) appear relatively strong, the declining revenue and EPS in the most recent quarter, coupled with negative technical indicators and extremely negative projected long-term returns, raise serious concerns. The recent price surge might be a temporary bounce, but the overall trend seems bearish.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent earnings decline is critical before any investment decisions are made. The extremely negative projected return needs to be further investigated to ascertain its validity.  A thorough analysis of industry trends, competitive pressures, and Nike's strategic response is required to assess the future prospects of the stock.  The high beta should be carefully considered by investors before entering the trade.
