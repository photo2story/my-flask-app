*   **Alpha:**  Recent negative Alpha values suggest NKE has been significantly underperforming its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Beta has generally increased in recent periods, suggesting NKE's price is becoming more sensitive to market movements.

**Analysis:**

*   The **RSI** in oversold territory *could* suggest a potential for a price reversal, but it needs to be confirmed by other indicators.
*   The **PPO** confirms the downtrend.
*   The **Hybrid Signal** suggests a very cautious stance, recommending a high cash position and selling a large portion of holdings.
*   The very low **Expected Return** indicates a highly pessimistic outlook compared to the S&P 500.
