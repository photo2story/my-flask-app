**0) Overview:**

Here's the breakdown of the data and analysis:

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** NKE (Nike Inc) - A global sportswear and apparel company.
*   **NKE Cumulative Return:** -25.26%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -127.5 (Relative Divergence: 3.0)

    *   **Analysis:** Nike has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The divergence of -127.5 indicates a large gap in performance. The Relative Divergence of 3.0 suggests that this underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range relative to VOO. This means that it has rarely been this bad in the past.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | -21.0% | 83.6% | -126.0% | 0.1 | 94.4   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** -21.0% indicates a substantial annual loss.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 83.6% shows a very large potential loss from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** -126.0% is extremely negative, meaning Nike has significantly underperformed expectations even when accounting for market risk.
*   **Beta:** 0.1 indicates Nike's price is substantially less volatile than the market as a whole.
*   **Cap(B):** $94.4 Billion Market Capitalization

    *   **Analysis:** This table paints a concerning picture. The negative CAGR, high MDD, and very negative Alpha suggest significant problems with Nike's performance over the 2024-2026 period. The company substantially underperformed the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 61.19
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 63.85, 'previousClose': 61.19, 'change': 4.35} (A significant jump in the last trading session)
*   **5-day SMA:** 60.13
*   **20-day SMA:** 63.69
*   **60-day SMA:** 64.76

    *   **Analysis:** The stock price has recently rebounded, as shown by the significant change in the last market data. The 5-day SMA is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend after a recent dip. The 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA, indicating that the price is still below the longer-term moving average, and may face resistance.

**3) Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 44.53 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.62 (Negative, but close to zero)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (25 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_0.41 Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 3.0 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1243.9% (Extremely negative long-term forecast)

    *   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI being near 50 indicates neutral momentum. The PPO is slightly negative, but close to zero, suggesting that the short-term momentum may soon change. The hybrid signal recommends a buy, even though the expected return is exceptionally negative, which might contradict the recommendation. The recent increase in relative divergence aligns with the recent price rebound. However, the extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive:** CEO buys $1M worth of stock, Insider Bets Ignite Investor Confidence, Goldman Sachs Forecast
*   **Negative:** Earnings Down 32%

    *   **Analysis:** Recent news paints a mixed picture. Positive news centers around insider buying and some bullish forecasts. However, a headline regarding Q2 2026 earnings reporting a 32% EPS decrease raises concerns about underlying financial performance. The insider buying could be seen as a positive signal, suggesting confidence in the company's future, but needs to be weighed against the earnings decline.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.92)
*   **Target Price:** 77.24 (Avg) / 120.00 (High) / 35.00 (Low)

    *   **Analysis:** Despite the negative data points, the analyst consensus remains a "Buy." The average target price suggests significant upside potential. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty and disagreement among analysts. Recent rating changes are not specified.
