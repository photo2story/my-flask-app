Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Nike (NKE) based on the data you provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (NKE vs. VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Nike Inc. is a global sportswear and equipment company.
*   **NKE Cumulative Return:** -26.57%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 91.00%
*   **Divergence:** -117.7 (Relative Divergence: 5.7)

**Analysis:**

*   Nike has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period in question. The -117.7 divergence highlights a considerable gap in returns.
*   The relative divergence of 5.7 suggests that this level of underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This *could* imply that the divergence is approaching an extreme and might suggest a potential for future convergence (though this is speculative).

**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:** The Alpha has been strongly negative in recent periods (2020-2025), indicating significant underperformance relative to its expected return based on its beta. This suggests factors beyond market movements are negatively impacting Nike.
*   **Beta:** The Beta consistently hovers around 1.0-1.2, suggesting that Nike's price tends to move roughly in line with or slightly more volatile than the overall market.
*   **CAGR:** The CAGR has declined significantly from strong growth in the 2016-2021 period to negative returns in the 2020-2025 timeframe.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) has increased, indicating greater risk and potential losses for investors.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has decreased, indicating the company's overall value has declined in recent periods

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** $63.28
*   **Previous Close:** $63.71
*   **Change:** -$0.67
*   **5-day SMA:** $62.06
*   **20-day SMA:** $63.46
*   **60-day SMA:** $64.57

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is below its 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which *could* be interpreted as a short-term bearish signal.  However, the 5-day SMA is below the current price, indicating a *potential* short-term upward trend. The stock is experiencing a slight dip currently.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 37.68
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.068
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (15 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 5.7 (+): 단기상승 (short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -593.2 (Significant negative expected return)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests a moderate level of confidence in Nike's potential, given the current market conditions.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 37.68 indicates that the stock is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* suggest a potential buying opportunity (but should be considered alongside other factors).
*   **PPO:** A PPO near zero suggests that the short-term moving average is close to the long-term moving average, indicating a lack of strong momentum in either direction.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** A positive change in divergence over the last 20 days indicates a potential short-term upward trend, as mentioned earlier.
*   **Expected Return:**  The extremely negative expected return (-593.2%) is very concerning and indicates significant concerns about Nike's future performance relative to the S&P 500. This number is extremely low and requires further validation of the calculation method.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Down 57%, Is Nike Stock a Buy in 2026? (The Motley Fool):** This headline suggests a significant decline in the stock price and prompts consideration of whether it represents a value opportunity.

**Analysis:**

*   The news headlines present a mixed picture. The headline about a significant decline and the question of whether it's a buy signal reflect current concerns. However, insider buying by the CEO and Tim Cook (Apple CEO) provides a potentially positive counterpoint, suggesting that some informed investors believe the stock is undervalued.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.92 on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is Strong Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 34
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** $77.24 / $120.00 / $35.00

**Analysis:**

*   The analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating.
*   The average target price of $77.24 suggests that analysts believe the stock has upside potential from its current price of $63.28. However, a low target of $35.00 signifies a large range of potential outcomes.
*   The lack of information on recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the direction of analyst sentiment.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Nike is currently facing a challenging situation:

*   **Negative Alpha:** Recent periods show substantial negative alpha, implying fundamental issues beyond market movements.
*   **Decreasing Profitability:** Declining ROE and fluctuating EPS suggest potential profitability challenges.
*   **Mixed Signals:** While the analyst consensus is still "Buy" and there has been insider buying, the stock price is below its moving averages, and the expected return is extremely negative.
*   **Potential Positives:** The RSI suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory, and there has been a short-term upward trend in the relative divergence. Recent news of insider buying may indicate confidence in the company's future.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the data provided, a neutral to cautiously negative outlook seems appropriate. While insider buying and analyst ratings offer some encouragement, the significant underperformance, negative alpha, declining profitability, and extremely negative expected return raise concerns.

**Before making any investment decision, it is essential to:**

*   **Verify the negative expected return:** The -593.2% expected return figure needs to be thoroughly investigated to ensure accuracy. If valid, it represents a major red flag.
*   **Conduct Further Research:**  Dig deeper into the reasons behind Nike's underperformance. Investigate any changes in consumer preferences, competition, supply chain issues, or strategic missteps.
*   **Consider Risk Tolerance:**  Assess your own risk tolerance and investment horizon. Nike's current volatility and uncertain outlook may not be suitable for all investors.
*   **Consult with a Financial Advisor:**  Seek professional advice from a qualified financial advisor who can provide personalized recommendations based on your specific circumstances.
