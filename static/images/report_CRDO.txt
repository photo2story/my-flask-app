**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

CRDO (Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd) is a fabless semiconductor company designing and developing high-speed SerDes (serializer/deserializer) technology.  The company has shown exceptional growth over the analyzed period, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO).  However, this high growth comes with considerable volatility.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **CRDO Cumulative Return:** 333.04%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 47.05%
* **Return Difference:** 286.0%
* **Relative Divergence:** 75.0% (This signifies CRDO's performance is in the 75th percentile of its historical divergence from VOO, not necessarily a 75% outperformance.)


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2022-2024  | 331.0% | 35.7% | 298.0% | -0.0 | 11.3 |
| 2023-2025  | 297.0% | 35.7% | 234.0% | 0.0 | 11.8 |

**Analysis:** CRDO exhibits exceptionally high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) but also a significant Maximum Drawdown (MDD). The high alpha values suggest substantial outperformance relative to the benchmark, while the near-zero beta indicates low correlation with the overall market.  The market capitalization is relatively small.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $70.48
* **Last Market Price:** $70.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $73.95
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $73.57
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $67.03

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's above the 60-day average indicating potential support. The recent slight increase from the previous close suggests a minor upward correction.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 41.4  (Slightly below 50, indicating a potentially oversold condition)
* **PPO:** -0.53 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -13.9% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 11.5% (This is a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500's potential return over the same time frame. However, remember this is a projected return.)


**Analysis:** The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the negative PPO and recent relative divergence indicate bearish momentum.  The price increase from the previous close is minimal and may not signal a significant trend reversal. The high expected return underscores the substantial potential, but also reflects the associated risk.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 2023-08-29 | -$0.08 | $0.04B     |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

CRDO shows immense growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this comes with substantial risk, evidenced by high volatility and negative EPS in recent quarters. While revenue is increasing and profit margins are strong, negative ROE requires further investigation.  The high projected long-term return is alluring, but investors must carefully consider the significant risk associated with this high-growth, high-volatility stock.  Thorough due diligence, including a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
