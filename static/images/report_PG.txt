| Date | EPS | Revenue |
|---|---|---|

**5. Overall Analysis:**

PG is a well-established company with a strong brand portfolio and a history of consistent performance. Despite recent underperformance against the S&P 500, the company is showing signs of resilience with a recent beat in earnings and continued cost management. However, its high RSI suggests potential short-term correction and the recent relative divergence in price movements suggests caution. Long-term investors might be attracted to the solid fundamentals and potential for growth indicated by the expected return. 

**6. Recommendations:**

While PG is a solid company with potential for long-term growth, its current overbought status and recent underperformance against the market suggest a wait-and-see approach. Investors may consider waiting for a pullback in price or a clearer signal of a sustained uptrend before making a significant investment.
