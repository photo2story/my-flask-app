**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  Further data is needed to assess profitability and financial health.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PG's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly.  While the company shows relative stability in revenue, the negative expected return and bearish technical indicators suggest caution. The lack of comprehensive financial data hampers a thorough assessment.  The negative expected return and the generally bearish technical analysis should be seriously considered before investment.  Further investigation into the discrepancies in the earnings data is crucial before drawing any firm conclusions.  The extremely negative expected return of -112.6% is a significant red flag and warrants further scrutiny of the model's assumptions and data inputs.
