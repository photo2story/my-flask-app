## Procter & Gamble Co (PG) Stock Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:** Procter & Gamble Co (PG) is a consumer staples company producing and marketing various household and personal care products.  While its cumulative return (81.51%) lags behind the S&P 500 (120.25%),  recent performance suggests a potential for recovery, although long-term outlook relative to the S&P 500 remains uncertain based on a projected negative alpha.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Procter & Gamble's cumulative return of 81.51% significantly underperforms the S&P 500's 120.25% return, resulting in a current lag of -38.7%.  This places PG at the 10.2 percentile of its historical performance range against the S&P 500, indicating it's relatively underperforming compared to its past performance against the benchmark.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance over the years.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has shown periods of strong growth (e.g., 43% and 58%), it's also experienced periods of negative or low growth, especially in the recent period (-5%).  The beta consistently remains around 0.1-0.8, indicating relatively low sensitivity to market movements. Alpha is mostly around 0 but has some periods of positive alpha. However, the projected alpha is -23.8%. This shows that the expected return is lower than the benchmark return. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) generally shows upward trend.  The negative alpha in the most recent period suggest the stock may underperform the market in the future.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $169.43
* **5-day Moving Average:** $168.56
* **20-day Moving Average:** $165.30
* **60-day Moving Average:** $167.87

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The recent price change of $1.13 (from the previous close) represents a positive daily movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 63.09 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.32 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -23.8% (Significant underperformance compared to S&P 500)


The recent price increase (indicated by the positive 'change' value) points to a small positive swing in price. However, the expected return is significantly negative when compared to the S&P 500. This is likely due to the poor performance compared to the S&P 500.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PG shows mixed signals. While financial health (high profit margins, stable revenue, reasonable ROE) appears strong, its recent performance lags behind the S&P 500. The projected negative alpha raises concerns about its future performance against the market.  Short-term indicators suggest an upward trend, but the long-term outlook (especially considering the projected -23.8% alpha) necessitates caution. Further analysis of the underlying reasons for the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is required before making investment decisions.  The recent earnings increase provides a positive signal, but consistency needs to be confirmed.  A more detailed fundamental analysis of competitive landscape and potential growth drivers would be necessary for a complete evaluation.
