## Procter & Gamble Co (PG) Stock Analysis

**0) Overview:** Procter & Gamble Co (PG) is a multinational consumer goods company that manufactures and markets a wide variety of products.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **PG Cumulative Return:** 74.51%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 121.84%
* **Return Difference:** -47.3%  (PG underperformed VOO significantly)
* **Relative Divergence:** 0.2 (This indicates that the current underperformance is near the lower end of the historical range of under/outperformance relative to VOO.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO). While some periods demonstrate positive alpha (outperformance), others show substantial underperformance.  The Beta generally hovers around 1, suggesting a similar volatility to the overall market but lacking consistent outperformance.  Note that the Cap(B) column, presumably representing market capitalization in billions, shows consistent growth, though this is unrelated to the relative performance against VOO.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $162.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $168.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $166.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $167.93

The price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend. The significant negative change from the previous close (-4.75%) indicates a recent drop in the stock price.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 35.59 (Below 40 suggests oversold conditions, potentially indicating a bounce.)
* **PPO:** 0.01 (Near zero, indicating a neutral momentum.)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -10.2% (Indicates a recent decrease in relative performance against the market.)
* **Expected Return:** -289.0% (This extremely negative figure needs further clarification.  It's likely a miscalculation or refers to a specific scenario not fully explained, not a realistic long-term projection.)

The large negative price change (-4.75%) reflects a significant recent drop, possibly due to factors not included in this data.  Further investigation into the cause is needed. The expected return is highly improbable and requires further investigation.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  There appears to be a potential error in the data, as 2025-01-22 is listed twice with different EPS values.  A more consistent upward trend in revenue isn't immediately apparent, but further analysis is needed to assess profitability trends properly.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2025-01-22 | 1.94 | $21.88 B     |
| 2024-10-18 | 1.65 | $21.74 B     |
| 2024-04-19 | 1.56 | $20.20 B     |
| 2024-01-23 | 1.44 | $21.44 B     |
| 2025-01-22 | 1.44 | $21.44 B     |  (Duplicate entry - likely an error)


**5) Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profit margin have been relatively stable over the past year, with minor fluctuations.  ROE is also relatively stable, though it shows some decline from Q3 to Q4.


| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity   | ROE    |
|------------|------------|---------------|----------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $21.88B   | 52.39%        | $51.17B  | 9.05%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $21.74B   | 52.06%        | $51.84B  | 7.64%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $20.53B   | 49.60%        | $50.29B  | 6.24%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $20.20B   | 51.20%        | $50.06B  | 7.50%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $21.44B   | 52.69%        | $48.53B  | 7.15%  |



**6) Overall Analysis:**

PG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. While some periods showed positive alpha, the overall trend indicates a relative underperformance against the market. Recent price action shows a bearish short-term trend, with the price below its moving averages.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, potentially setting the stage for a rebound. However, the extremely negative expected return figure requires further investigation and clarification.  The earnings data exhibits some inconsistencies requiring correction. Financial information shows stable revenue and relatively consistent profit margins and ROE, indicating a generally healthy financial position despite the stock's recent underperformance.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes of the recent price drop and the long-term outlook.  The data provided is insufficient for a fully comprehensive analysis, and further investigation into earnings data and the unusually low expected return value is recommended.
