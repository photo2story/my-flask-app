## Procter & Gamble Co (PG) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Procter & Gamble Co (PG) is a multinational consumer goods company.  While its cumulative return (63.22%) slightly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (66.27%) over the analyzed period,  its relative performance shows some resilience, especially considering its lower beta. Further analysis is needed to determine its future potential.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Procter & Gamble's cumulative return of 63.22% slightly lagged behind the S&P 500's 66.27% return. The difference of -3.1% positions it at the 45.5th percentile of its historical performance range against the S&P 500 (-30.5% to 29.7%). This indicates that the current underperformance is not an outlier compared to its historical performance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance across different periods.  While Alpha is generally low (close to zero or slightly positive), indicating modest outperformance against the market, Beta is consistently around 0.3, suggesting lower volatility than the overall market (a Beta of 1 indicates equal volatility).  The consistent, relatively low beta across the analyzed periods further supports its defensive nature.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows relatively stable revenue, fluctuating around $21 Billion.  EPS growth appears inconsistent.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of this variation and whether this reflects underlying business health or temporary factors.

**5. Financial Information:**

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PG demonstrates consistent revenue and high profit margins, pointing to a strong and stable business model. However, recent performance slightly lagged the S&P 500. The relatively low beta suggests lower volatility than the broader market, making it a potentially defensive investment. The expected long-term return of 9.7% is positive, but further investigation into the drivers of earnings fluctuations and a deeper dive into the company's competitive landscape and future growth prospects are recommended before making an investment decision.  The relatively low alpha suggests that outperformance might be limited unless significant changes occur in the company's fundamentals or market conditions.
