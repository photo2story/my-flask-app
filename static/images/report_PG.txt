| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |

Note that there's a duplicated entry for 2025-04-24.  The data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue, requiring further analysis to determine underlying trends and factors influencing these changes.  A more comprehensive dataset would be necessary for a robust evaluation.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a complete financial analysis.  This data is crucial for understanding PG's profitability and overall financial health.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PG currently shows a moderate underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with indicators suggesting a potentially oversold condition. However, the limited financial data and recent negative price movement relative to moving averages raise concerns. While the projected 30% return over two years is positive, this projection requires more rigorous supporting data.  Further investigation into the reasons for fluctuating EPS and revenue, along with obtaining complete financial information, is essential before drawing definitive conclusions about PG's investment prospects.
