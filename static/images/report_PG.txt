## Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) is a multinational consumer goods company that manufactures and markets a wide range of products, including household goods, personal care products, and pet supplies.

Over the period analyzed, PG's cumulative return (97.73%) lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (128.86%).  The difference is -31.1%, placing it at the 20.3rd percentile of its historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-48.3% to 36.5%).  This indicates that while PG underperformed the market, its relative underperformance is not exceptionally extreme compared to its historical performance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistent positive alpha (ranging from 0.9 to 1.2) indicating that PG has historically outperformed the market (as represented by its beta) to varying degrees. Beta fluctuates around 1.0, suggesting relatively similar volatility to the overall market.  The company's market capitalization (Cap(B)) has steadily grown over the period.  Note that the provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures are likely highly influenced by market conditions in the respective periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $179.36 (Last Market: $179.33)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $177.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $169.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $170.55

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates less short-term volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 90.5 – This extremely high RSI value suggests the stock is significantly overbought and may be due for a correction.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.87 – A positive value indicates upward momentum, although the magnitude needs to be considered within a broader context.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +20.3 – Shows a recent period of outperformance relative to the S&P 500. This is a short-term metric, not necessarily indicative of future performance.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% - This suggests that, at the current valuation, analysts predict no significant excess return over the risk-free rate in the short-term.  A longer-term (2+ years) outlook with consistent investing may result in returns potentially exceeding the S&P 500 but this cannot be quantified based on the provided data. The provided data doesn't specify what the baseline (risk-free rate) is for expected return calculations.


The closing price of $179.33 is close to the last market price. No significant immediate 급반등 (sharp upward surge) or 급하락 (sharp downward plunge) is evident from this limited data.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data show some fluctuations.  While recent quarters show slightly lower EPS compared to previous quarters, the revenue remains relatively stable around $21 billion.  Crucially, we lack the EPS estimates to evaluate whether the actual results met or beat analyst expectations.  This information is essential for a complete analysis.  The repeated entry for 2024-10-18 suggests a potential data entry error.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, while profit margins show some minor fluctuations, generally remaining high.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been increasing, and ROE (Return on Equity) has fluctuated but generally remains positive.

Both sections demonstrate a healthy financial position, though deeper analysis including comparison to industry peers and analysis of cash flow is warranted.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

PG demonstrates a history of relatively stable performance, with consistent revenue and generally positive alpha relative to the S&P 500.  However, the recent RSI value suggests the stock may be overbought, indicating a potential short-term correction is likely.  The lack of information on earnings expectations prevents a full assessment of recent performance.  Long-term investors might find PG appealing due to its history of consistent performance and strong financial position, but careful consideration of the overbought conditions and current market sentiment is necessary.
