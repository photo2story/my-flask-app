While the provided data doesn't explicitly state the timeframe for this cumulative return calculation, it is significantly below the S&P 500 performance.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 17.64 (Extremely oversold; suggesting potential bounce, but also potential for further decline)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -8.7% (Short-term price decline relative to the overall trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -230.8% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is highly unusual and warrants further investigation into the methodology used to calculate this figure.  It likely indicates a significant underperformance projection).

The current price of $160.60 is below the moving averages, suggesting a possible continuation of the downward trend, though the extremely oversold RSI could indicate a short-term bounce is possible.  However, the negative expected return is a major concern.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PG currently shows signs of underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend.
