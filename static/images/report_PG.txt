**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or analyst opinions are provided.  This section requires additional information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PG's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly. While the company shows stable revenue and generally positive financial metrics, there's a lack of substantial growth, as indicated by the relatively flat revenue and inconsistent EPS trend.  The relatively low RSI indicates the stock is currently oversold, potentially suggesting a short-term rebound. However, without additional information (news, analyst opinions and a clear explanation of the expected return calculation and time horizon), it's difficult to provide strong buy/sell recommendations. The negative PPO and the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 suggest caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the decreased ROE and EPS and any market factors impacting PG's performance is necessary before making an investment decision. The provided expected return of 0% requires further clarification.
