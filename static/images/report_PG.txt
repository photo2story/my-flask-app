PG has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and its recent stock price is below its moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend.

A cautious approach is warranted.  Investors might consider a small allocation, keeping a close eye on upcoming earnings and the success of restructuring efforts. Monitoring the next earnings report and any further news related to the restructuring will be critical.
