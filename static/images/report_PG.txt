**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Procter & Gamble Co (PG) is a consumer goods company producing and marketing a wide variety of household goods.  Over the analyzed period, PG significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a cumulative return of 78.49% compared to VOO's 119.91%.  The -41.4% difference places it at the 7.1 percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others demonstrate negative alpha, suggesting the stock's returns aren't consistently beating the market.  Beta values generally hover around 1, indicating a similar level of volatility to the market.  The substantial variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across different periods further highlights the inconsistency in performance.  For instance the high CAGR values between 2017-2020 are followed by periods of significantly lower or even negative returns.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 21.0% | 2.0% | -8.0% | 0.1 | 177.8 |

| 2018-2020  | 58.0% | 8.2% | 30.0% | 0.3 | 293.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 65.0% | 8.2% | -6.0% | 0.2 | 354.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

PG's price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it's above its 20-day moving average, indicating some potential for upward movement.  The recent price decrease of -$0.85 (from $167.41 to $165.99) shows a slight downward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 70.57 suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory, indicating potential for a short-term correction.  A PPO of 0.58 points towards a bullish trend, but considering the RSI, it might be prudent to be cautious. The recent 20-day relative divergence increase of +5.0% signifies a short-term upward trend. The expected return of -33.9% over the long-term relative to the S&P 500 warrants further investigation to understand the basis for this negative forecast.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings show a relatively stable revenue stream, but EPS growth is not consistently strong. The last two data points in the table have inconsistent data, requiring verification.  Further analysis is needed to assess the long-term growth potential based on this data alone.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PG has demonstrated inconsistent performance relative to the S&P 500, underperforming significantly over the analyzed period.  While the company shows strong and stable revenue and high profit margins,  the inconsistent EPS growth and the negative long-term expected return relative to the market raise concerns. The current technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction.  Before making any investment decisions, a more in-depth analysis considering macroeconomic factors, competitive landscape, and future growth projections is strongly recommended. The inconsistent data provided requires verification and clarification.  The -33.9% long-term expected return projection needs further justification.
