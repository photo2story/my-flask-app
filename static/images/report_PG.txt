**6. Overall Analysis:**

PG shows mixed signals. While its long-term performance has generally been positive, indicated by periods of positive alpha and increasing market capitalization, recent performance is lagging behind the S&P 500.  The current price is below key moving averages, suggesting bearish short-term momentum. The high MRI and negative PPO further support a cautious outlook.  The recent significant price drop requires further investigation to determine the underlying causes.  The -7.9% expected return projection for long-term investment (2+ years) indicates a potentially lower return compared to the S&P 500, based on currently available data, but this should be revisited in light of the significant daily price drop.  A thorough analysis of the reasons for the recent price drop and a deeper dive into the earnings and financial data are recommended before making any investment decisions.  Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized guidance.
