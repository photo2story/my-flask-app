**6. Overall Analysis:**

PG exhibits mixed performance. While the company displays strong revenue and profitability, its recent stock performance lags behind the S&P 500.  The negative long-term expected return (-16.2%) is a significant concern and requires further investigation into the methodology used for that calculation.  The recent earnings show a positive trend in EPS, but further analysis is needed to understand the complete picture due to the inconsistencies and the data errors (Duplicate entry).  Short-term technical indicators suggest a mildly positive trend, but the long-term outlook appears uncertain based on the provided data and the significant underperformance compared to the benchmark (VOO).  Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and the reliability of the long-term expected return calculation is crucial.
