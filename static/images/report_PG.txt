## Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Relative Strength:**

Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) is a multinational consumer goods company that produces and markets a wide range of products.  The provided data shows PG's cumulative return significantly lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns is approximately -37.4%.  While this underperformance is substantial, the relative strength indicator (-37.4 out of a range of -43.5 to 38.9) positions it relatively higher than its minimum recorded underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, indicating a small degree of outperformance relative to the market, though this is contradicted by the cumulative return analysis.  Beta consistently sits around 1, suggesting similar volatility to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $171.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $171.12
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $174.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $170.57

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, indicating a recent minor downward trend. It is also below its 20-day and significantly below its 60-day moving average, further suggesting a longer-term bearish trend.  The slight difference between the last market close and the closing price suggests minimal change in after-hours trading.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 35.45 (This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.)
* **PPO:** -0.48 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -2.1% (Indicates a recent period of weakening relative strength.)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This signifies no expected outperformance over the S&P 500 in the long term given the current data, and thus, requires further analysis to understand the outlook.  A 0% return implies a possible riskier investment depending on risk appetite and diversification strategy).

The low RSI and negative PPO signal bearish sentiment.  The negative relative strength change points to underperformance against the benchmark. The provided 0.0% expected return needs further justification and analysis. This value likely requires more sophisticated modelling, and given that it is 0%, there could be other factors not specified here that are influencing future expected returns.  Given a long-term, (2+ year) investment horizon, additional factors and data should be investigated in order to achieve a more thorough expected return analysis.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates, showing no clear upward or downward trend over the past few quarters. There's no consistent pattern observable from the provided data.
* **EPS:** EPS has also seen some fluctuation.  The most recent quarter (2024-10-18) shows a lower EPS (1.65) than the previous quarter (1.89).  The data does not provide enough information for a trend analysis.
* **Beats/Misses:** The data does not provide information to determine whether these numbers beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some variability. Profit margins are relatively stable, ranging from 49.60% to 52.69%.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been steadily increasing. ROE is also somewhat variable, reflecting changes in profitability and equity.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook/analyst opinions are provided.  The absence of this context limits the scope of this analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PG's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest bearish sentiment.  Earnings data reveals some volatility in both revenue and EPS, without a clear trend. While the company shows stable profit margins and increasing equity, the lack of positive momentum in both the stock price and earnings data raises concerns.  Further analysis including a more thorough examination of market sentiment, analyst ratings, and economic forecasts is needed to form a more comprehensive opinion.  The lack of recent news further hinders a robust analysis.
