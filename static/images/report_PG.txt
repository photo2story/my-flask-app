**7. Overall Analysis:**

PG's recent performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500.  While the company displays strong revenue and profit margins, the low RSI and PPO suggest a bearish outlook. The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 is concerning, especially given the considerable underperformance observed. While the company's fundamentals appear relatively stable, the current market sentiment and recent price action paint a negative picture.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent underperformance, including macroeconomic factors and company-specific news, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The extremely negative long-term expected return projection should be treated with caution, as such extreme values are typically subject to significant uncertainty.
