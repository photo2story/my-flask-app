The cumulative return difference as of the last data point is -42.7%. This places PG at the 3.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided minimum and maximum divergence. While PG has exhibited periods of strong growth (as seen in the CAGR column), it has consistently lagged behind the S&P 500 over the longer term.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistently low alpha (around 0.1), indicating that PG has generated returns close to the market benchmark.

However, this beta value seems unusually high for a market capitalization figure and likely needs further verification. The provided data is inconsistent.  A more consistent beta figure is needed to confidently assess PG's volatility.

**7. Overall Summary:**

PG's performance relative to the S&P 500 is concerning, with a significant and persistent underperformance.  While the company shows some strength in its financial statements, the consistent underperformance and negative expected return warrant caution.  The provided data contains inconsistencies (particularly concerning Beta and duplicate earnings entries) that need to be addressed before drawing definitive conclusions.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, potentially implying a short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook is less positive based on the provided expected return.  Further investigation is required to understand the reasons for the underperformance and to validate the provided -58.7% long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500.  The unusually high Beta values also require verification.
