**7. Overall Analysis:**

PG's current situation presents a mixed picture. While the company demonstrates strong and consistent profitability and revenue, its stock performance significantly lags the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but the negative expected return and the price being below its moving averages paint a bearish outlook.  The inconsistent earnings data requires further investigation.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough assessment of the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape is necessary. The -48.7% expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern and requires careful consideration.  Further due diligence is strongly advised before making an investment.
