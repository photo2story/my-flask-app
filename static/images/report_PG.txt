* **Closing Price:** $179.36 (Last market: $179.33)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $177.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $169.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $170.55

The price is currently above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small difference between the last market price and closing price indicates minimal intraday volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 90.5 - This indicates the stock is significantly overbought, suggesting a potential pullback is likely.

Given the extremely high RSI (90.5), the stock is in overbought territory. While the recent price movement shows strength, this RSI reading suggests caution, as it signals a high likelihood of a correction.  The expected return of 0.0% suggests that, based on the data available, there's no significant expectation of alpha generation relative to the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment. This is despite positive signals such as positive PPO and recent price appreciation.

PG shows consistent profitability and revenue generation, despite some fluctuations in EPS and ROE.

Long-term investors looking at a 2+ year horizon may need to consider the high RSI and the lack of substantial expected alpha, and adjust investment strategy accordingly, taking into account that this analysis does not account for broader macroeconomic factors or company-specific news.  More information is needed on recent news and analyst opinions to fully assess current market sentiment.
