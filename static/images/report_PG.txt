2025-01-22 - Analysis Report
## Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) is a multinational consumer goods corporation that manufactures and markets a wide range of products.  The provided data shows that PG's cumulative return (72.88%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.36%) over the analyzed period. The difference is a substantial -47.5%, placing it at the 0th percentile of the historical range of relative performance against the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance relative to the market benchmark.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows a consistently low beta (around 0.1) across the analyzed periods, suggesting that PG's price movements are less volatile than the overall market.  Alpha, while consistently positive, is relatively small (around 0.1), implying only slight outperformance compared to the market's risk-adjusted returns.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates considerably from year to year, indicating periods of strong growth and periods of weak performance or even negative returns.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $161.72
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $160.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $164.20
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $168.42

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term bearish trend.  The recent price change of $0.37 (up from the previous close) is minimal, however, and doesn't strongly suggest a significant shift in momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 28.81 – This indicates that the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.06 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -3.8% -  This negative divergence confirms the short-term bearish trend.

* **Expected Return:** -247.4% – This extremely negative long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern and needs further investigation.  The extremely negative figure warrants careful examination of the methodology used to calculate this prediction and the underlying assumptions.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue, but no clear consistent upward or downward trend is immediately apparent.  A deeper analysis, including comparison to analyst estimates and sector performance, is needed to draw firm conclusions. The repetition of the 2024-10-18 entry in the earnings data needs clarification.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-18 | 1.65 | $21.74B       |
| 2024-04-19 | 1.56 | $20.20B       |
| 2024-01-23 | 1.44 | $21.44B       |
| 2023-10-18 | 1.89 | $21.87B       |
| 2024-10-18 | 1.89 | $21.87B       |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals relatively consistent revenue and high profit margins, indicating a strong and profitable core business.  However, a slight decline is visible in some recent quarters. ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, showing periods of higher and lower returns.  Further analysis, including comparison to industry averages and competitor performance, is crucial.


| Quarter    | Revenue     | Profit Margin | Equity     | ROE   |
|------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| 2024-09-30 | $21.74B     | 52.06%        | $51.84B    | 7.64% |
| 2024-06-30 | $20.53B     | 49.60%        | $50.29B    | 6.24% |
| 2024-03-31 | $20.20B     | 51.20%        | $50.06B    | 7.50% |
| 2023-12-31 | $21.44B     | 52.69%        | $48.53B    | 7.15% |
| 2023-09-30 | $21.87B     | 51.99%        | $47.69B    | 9.48% |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PG demonstrates a strong, stable, and profitable business model, as evidenced by consistent revenues and high profit margins. However, its recent performance has lagged significantly behind the broader market (S&P 500). The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant red flag and requires careful scrutiny.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce from oversold conditions, but the overall trend appears bearish.  A more comprehensive analysis, including a deeper dive into the -247.4% expected return calculation, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors, is necessary to form a complete investment opinion.  The conflicting signals (oversold RSI, negative PPO, and the extremely negative long-term expected return) necessitate further investigation before making any investment decisions.
