**7. Overall Analysis:**

PG shows consistent profitability and relatively stable revenue. However, its recent performance lags behind the S&P 500 significantly.  The short-term price action is bearish, although some technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term rebound.  The extremely negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern and requires further investigation into the methodology used to arrive at that figure.  A thorough review of the company's future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate data entry requires correction and clarification.  More context is needed to interpret the financial and performance data accurately.
