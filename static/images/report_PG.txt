**1) Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) is a multinational consumer goods company that produces and markets a wide range of products.  Over the review period, PG significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), lagging by 39.7 percentage points. While the relative divergence suggests this underperformance is not entirely unusual historically, it's still a significant gap.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha (excess return compared to the market) and a relatively stable beta (market sensitivity) around 0.2-0.5.  This suggests PG is relatively less volatile than the overall market (beta less than 1) but with varying degrees of outperformance or underperformance in different periods.  Noteworthy is the substantial negative CAGR of -5% from 2022-2024, potentially reflecting broader market factors. The high CAGR values in several years suggest cyclical periods of strong growth.

Investors should carefully consider this underperformance against the market and the potentially overbought RSI before making any investment decisions. Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and a thorough comparison with competitors within the consumer goods sector are recommended.
