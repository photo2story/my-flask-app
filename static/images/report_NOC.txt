*   **Company Overview:** Northrop Grumman Corp. is a global aerospace and defense technology company.
*   **NOC Cumulative Return:** 37.27%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 91.40%
*   **Divergence:** -67.8 (Relative Divergence: 5.1)

**Analysis:**

The relative divergence of 5.1 suggests that the current underperformance is near the lowest end of its historical fluctuation range compared to VOO.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| 2016-2018  | -8.0%   | 97.8%  | -11.0%  | 0.7  | 35.1   |
| 2017-2019  | 15.0%   | 99.7%  | -2.0%   | 0.7  | 49.2   |
| 2018-2020  | -25.0%  | 99.7%  | -46.0%  | 0.8  | 43.6   |
| 2019-2021  | 40.0%   | 78.4%  | -3.0%   | 0.7  | 55.4   |
| 2020-2022  | 18.0%   | 63.4%  | 19.0%   | 0.6  | 78.1   |
| 2021-2023  | 23.0%   | 68.3%  | 22.0%   | 0.3  | 67.0   |
| 2022-2024  | -14.0%  | 77.2%  | -33.0%  | 0.3  | 67.2   |
| 2023-2025  | -1.0%   | 69.9%  | -63.0%  | 0.1  | 81.6   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:**  NOC consistently had negative alpha except for 2020-2022 and 2021-2023, indicating underperformance relative to its expected return based on its beta and the market return (S&P 500).  The recent large negative alpha (-63.0%) in 2023-2025 is particularly concerning.
*   **Beta:** The beta has generally trended downwards, indicating that NOC's price movements are becoming less correlated with the market. A beta of 0.1 from 2023-2025 indicates very low correlation to the S&P 500.
*   **CAGR & MDD:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates, with negative values in several periods. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values are very high, which show the risk of investing in NOC is very high, even though the market cap is large.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 570.21
*   **Previous Close:** 574.57
*   **Change:** -0.76
*   **5-day SMA:** 576.46
*   **20-day SMA:** 566.42
*   **60-day SMA:** 578.42

**Analysis:**

The stock price has recently decreased (-0.76 change), closing at 570.21. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which indicates a short term bullish trend. However, the 60-day SMA is above the 5-day SMA and the 20-day SMA. This suggests that the recent trend may be short-lived.

**3) Indicators**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 59.09
*   **PPO:** 0.2386
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_2.31 Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.5 (negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.9 suggests a high investment recommendation according to the provided scale.  However, this should be viewed cautiously in light of other indicators.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 59.09 is neutral.  It's neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.2386 is slightly positive, indicating that the shorter-term moving average is slightly above the longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, although this recommendation may conflict with other data points.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence indicates that NOC is underperforming VOO in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 0.0% is not encouraging.

*   **Positive:**
    *   Merit Financial Group LLC Purchased NOC Shares (Indicates institutional investor confidence).
    *   Northrop Grumman Declares Quarterly Dividend (Good for income investors).
*   **Negative:**

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed. While the dividend declaration and institutional buying are positive, the articles discussing the stock's decline post-earnings and the rating downgrade raise concerns.  The oversold condition could present an opportunity, but it also signals underlying weakness.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.04)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 662.68 / 770.00 / 533.00

**Analysis:**

Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating on NOC. The average target price suggests upside potential from the current price of 570.21.  However, the low target price is close to the current price, which means the target price range is wide.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue  |
|------------|------|----------|
| 2025-10-21 | 7.69 | 10.42 B$ |

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

NOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting a large negative divergence.  While analysts maintain a "Buy" rating with a potential upside based on target prices, several factors warrant caution:

*   **Underperformance:** The consistent negative Alpha indicates that NOC is not generating returns as high as its Beta (market correlation) suggests.
*   **Recent Weakness:** Recent news highlights concerns about the stock's performance after earnings, alongside a rating downgrade.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** The MRI suggests high investment potential, but the expected return is 0%, the stock is oversold, and NOC is underperforming VOO in the short term.
*   **Financial Health:** NOC shows stable revenue, solid profit margins, and increasing equity. However, EPS shows volatility, and ROE fluctuates.
*   **Technicals:** The stock is trading below its 5-day and 60-day SMA.

**Overall Recommendation:**

While analysts have buy ratings, based on the data provided, a **neutral to slightly negative outlook** is warranted. The underperformance relative to the S&P 500, recent negative news, and conflicting signals from various indicators suggest that potential investors should exercise caution. Further research into the reasons behind the recent stock decline, the rating downgrade, and the causes of the fluctuating ROE would be beneficial before making any investment decisions. Investors should closely monitor NOC's performance in the coming quarters to see if it can improve its Alpha, reduce its divergence from the S&P 500, and address the concerns highlighted in recent news reports. The high MDD shows this is a very risky stock and would not be suitable for conservative investors.
