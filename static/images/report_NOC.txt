Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Northrop Grumman (NOC) based on the provided data, presented in a structured manner with simple numbers followed by analysis:

**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Northrop Grumman Corp is a global aerospace and defense technology company.
*   **NOC Cumulative Return:** 44.10%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 102.37%
*   **Divergence:** -57.0 (Relative Divergence: 1.1)

**Analysis:**

*   NOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the tracked period. The S&P 500 more than doubled investors' money, while NOC provided less than half that return.
*   The divergence of -57.0 indicates a substantial difference in performance, with NOC lagging significantly behind the broader market. The relative divergence of 1.1 suggests that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range.
*   The provided Alpha/Beta analysis suggests inconsistent performance. Alpha, representing excess return compared to the market, is highly variable and often negative. Beta, indicating volatility relative to the market, is generally low (around 0-0.9), suggesting that NOC's price movements are less sensitive to overall market fluctuations.
    *   CAGR shows big fluctuation over the course with max 46% in 2015-2017 and min -28% in 2018-2020.
    *   MDD seems to be high and stable above 60%, which indicates the company requires big capital to recover.

*   **Last Market Price:** 569.76 (Change: 1.74)
*   **5-day SMA:** 552.30
*   **20-day SMA:** 559.25
*   **60-day SMA:** 582.96

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a short-term downtrend.  The price is slightly above the 5-day SMA, suggesting a possible recent stabilization or minor rebound.
*   The recent "Last Market" price increase of 1.74 suggests some upward momentum, but it's important to see if this is sustained.

**3. Market Indicators**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 42.76
*   **PPO:** 0.0511
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend\_2.31 Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)"
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -3.5 (Negative Trend)
*   **Expected Return:** -562.8% (Negative Excess Return vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk, indicating that the stock is not currently considered highly risky but not a safe bet either.
*   The RSI of 42.76 is in neutral territory (30-70), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   The PPO of 0.0511 indicates a slight upward momentum in the short term.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends a full investment using cash, indicating an attractive entry point according to this model.
*   The negative change in relative divergence (-3.5) reinforces the short-term downward trend.
*   The highly negative Expected Return is a major red flag, suggesting that, based on the model, long-term investment in NOC from the current point is expected to underperform the S&P 500 significantly.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

NOC's performance is mixed. It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend. While analysts have a generally positive outlook (Buy rating, higher target prices), negative factors such as institutional selling, a valuation reassessment, and recent divergence contribute to the potential decline. The financial data presents a more positive picture with strong revenue and high profit margins, but the inconsistencies in the company's financial reporting may indicate the need to analyze other reports.

*   **Key Concerns:**  Significant underperformance vs. the market, a negative "expected return," and the negative trend in relative divergence. The volatile EPS also warrants further investigation.
*   **Positive Factors:**  Strong revenue, high profit margins, positive analyst sentiment, and potential for price appreciation based on target prices.
*   **Overall:**  NOC appears to be a high-risk investment at the moment. A lot of negative news and downward trend in all the indicator make the stock less attractive than the S&P 500, and further due diligence is needed to assess the underlying reasons for the underperformance and negative outlook before considering a long-term investment.
