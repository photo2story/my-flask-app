**1) Return Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Northrop Grumman Corp. is a global aerospace and defense technology company.
*   **Return Divergence:** NOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period examined. The cumulative return is roughly half of VOO's. The current divergence of -53.4 places it near the lower end of its historical divergence range (Relative Divergence of 5.2). This suggests that while NOC has underperformed, it may be nearing a point of potential rebound relative to the market.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals some interesting trends.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is low during the period, generally in the range of 0.0-0.2. Beta measures a stock's volatility in relation to the market. A beta close to 0 suggests low volatility or weak correlation with the overall market. This makes sense for a defense stock that may be less susceptible to general economic conditions.
    *   **Alpha:** The inconsistent Alpha values show that NOC's performance sometimes surpasses what would be expected given the risk. The negative Alpha values indicate periods of underperformance relative to expectations. In the recent time frame, Alpha has been significantly negative, meaning the company is underperforming expectations.
    *   **CAGR and MDD:** The fluctuating CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) point to a company that experiences high returns but significant volatility. The recent CAGR of -1.0% with an MDD of 82.1% shows a difficult recent period.
    *   **Capitalization (Cap):** NOC's capitalization has generally increased over the periods, indicating growth in the company's value.

**2) Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   The current price of NOC is 577.37, down slightly from the previous close.
*   The 5-day SMA (578.58) is slightly above the current price, while the 20-day SMA (563.55) is significantly below the current price, and the 60-day SMA (580.01) is slightly above the current price. This indicates a mixed trend. The price has bounced up from the 20-day average but has been declining in comparison to the 60-day SMA.

**3) Indicators Analysis**

*   **MRI (1.0):** The Market Risk Indicator suggests that investment in NOC is currently considered to be high recommended.
*   **RSI (66.52):** The RSI is slightly above 60, which may suggest that the stock is approaching slightly overbought conditions.
*   **PPO (0.55):** The Positive Price Oscillator (PPO) is positive and under 1, suggesting a slightly bullish trend, as the shorter moving average (12 day EMA) is above the longer moving average (26 day EMA).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying and allocating 100% of cash to the stock, but this conflicts with the expected return and Alpha analysis. This buy recommendation could be attributable to the MRI of 0.9.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence suggests a short-term decline in NOC's performance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-151.2%) is a major red flag. This suggests that, based on current analysis, an investment in NOC is expected to underperform the S&P 500 significantly over the long term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news headlines present a mixed picture.
    *   **Positive:** "Analysts See a 19% Upside" suggests potential for growth. The "Northrop Grumman Signal 25/12: More Gains Ahead? (Chart)" article also suggests bullish momentum.
    *   **Negative:** "Northrop Grumman: An Argument For Buying At Undervaluation (Rating Downgrade)" points to concerns and potential downgrades. "Northrop Grumman Corporation $NOC Shares Sold by Voya Investment Management LLC" indicates institutional selling pressure. "Northrop Grumman is Now Oversold (NOC)" points to a potential price bounce but also underlies some concern.
*   **MarketBeat:** The MarketBeat news suggests that Voya Investment Management sold shares, which could signal concerns from a significant investor.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** The analyst consensus is leaning towards a "Buy" rating (2.04).
*   **Target Price:** The average target price of 662.68 represents a potential upside from the current price (577.37).
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Lack of rating changes indicates analyst views may be stable, or there hasn't been significant activity recently.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

*   **EPS Trends:** EPS (Earnings Per Share) has been volatile. The EPS of 3.33 in 2025-04-22 indicates a significant underperformance, which could be a concern.
*   **Revenue Trends:** Revenue has been relatively stable around 10B$, but there was a drop in 2025-04-22. The Revenue of 9.47 B$ in 2025-04-22 indicates a significant underperformance, which could be a concern.
*   **Date Issue:** The duplicate date of 2025-10-21 should be resolved. One row should reflect the 2024-10-24 numbers.

**6) Financial Information**

*   **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable. Profit margins are strong, consistently above 20% for most quarters, indicating good operational efficiency. The exception is the quarter ending March 31, 2025, with a lower profit margin of 16.69%.
*   **Capital & Profitability:** Equity has been increasing slowly over the quarters. The ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, with the highest being 8.27% in December 2024 and the lowest at 3.21% in March 2025.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Northrop Grumman (NOC) presents a mixed investment picture. Here's a summary of the key takeaways:

*   **Underperformance:** NOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) recently.
*   **Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility as indicated by the MDD.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Analyst opinions are generally positive, but the expected return is highly negative. News headlines are also mixed, with some suggesting upside potential while others highlight concerns like rating downgrades and institutional selling.
*   **Financial Health:** The company maintains strong profit margins and generates steady revenue. Equity has also been growing over time. However, there was a significant Revenue and EPS underperformance in 2025-04-22.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The MRI indicates that the investment is recommended. The RSI is at 66.52, which may be approaching overbought conditions. The recent short-term decline indicates that price could decline soon.

**Recommendation:**

While analysts have a consensus buy and a positive target price for NOC, several data points are conflicting and present causes for concern.

The strong fundamentals, the potential buy signal from the MRI, and the consensus buy of NOC are in conflict with NOC's underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the extremely low expected return. The hybrid signal also seems in conflict.

Given this conflicting data and the overall negative picture portrayed from the expected return and underperformance, it is recommended to hold or reduce positions in the stock rather than to increase positions. More in-depth investigation should occur to investigate the cause of the large negative expected return.
