    *   MRI: 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
    *   RSI: 63.85 (Approaching overbought territory)
    *   PPO: 0.31 (Positive, suggesting a slight upward trend)
    *   Recent Relative Divergence Change: 2.9 (+) (Short-term increase)
    *   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
    *   Expected Return: -134.9%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation.
    *   The RSI is nearing overbought levels (above 70 is generally considered overbought).
    *   The positive PPO indicates some positive momentum.
    *   The Hybrid Signal recommends a strong buy with a small monthly investment, likely based on the MRI and other factors.
    *   **The extremely negative Expected Return of -134.9% is a HUGE red flag.** This suggests that, based on the model used to calculate this, long-term investment in NOC from this point is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500. This contradicts the Hybrid Signal's recommendation and is the most important piece of information to investigate further.
