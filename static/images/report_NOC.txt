**8. Overall Analysis:**

NOC shows strong and consistent revenue but mixed signals concerning its profitability. The recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-28.48%) and the negative PPO indicate a bearish short-term outlook. However, the oversold RSI (41.57) hints at a potential short-term bounce.  The long-term outlook depends heavily on resolving the causes for the weak Q4 2023 results and the 0% expected return. Further research into recent news, analyst opinions, and a comparison of Q4 2024 results against expectations are vital for a comprehensive evaluation.
