*   **RSI:** 36.25 (Approaching oversold territory)

    *   The hybrid signal suggests a buying opportunity.
    *   **Expected Return:** The strongly negative expected return of -212.7% is a significant red flag, suggesting analysts believe the stock is currently overvalued relative to its future earnings potential, and/or market conditions will be very unfavorable to this company.
    *   **Divergence Change:** The recent short-term decline in relative divergence aligns with the price being below its moving averages.

*   **Opinions:** 19
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 667.21 / 770.00 / 533.00

However, it's crucial to note the wide range between the high and low target prices, reflecting considerable uncertainty. Without rating changes the recent rating changes is not useful.

*   **Negative Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-212.7%) is a major concern and contradicts some of the other indicators.
*   **Analyst Disagreement:** News articles reflect differing opinions on the stock's prospects. However, the current mean analyst consensus is "buy".

Based on this data, a cautious approach to NOC is warranted. While analyst ratings remain positive and some financial metrics are strong, the significant underperformance, negative expected return, and recent price action raise concerns. It is vital to investigate why the expected return is so negative and potentially question the reliability of the MRI indicator. Potential investors should carefully weigh these factors and conduct further research before making any decisions. A key consideration should be understanding the discrepancy between the analyst consensus and the strongly negative expected return.
