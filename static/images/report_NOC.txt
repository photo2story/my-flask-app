*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Highly variable, showing periods of strong growth and significant decline. Recent periods (2022-2025) show negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High across all periods, indicating significant volatility and potential for substantial losses.  The consistently high MDD suggests NOC is sensitive to market downturns or company-specific challenges.
*   **Alpha:** Mostly negative in recent periods (2017-2025), meaning NOC has underperformed its expected return based on its beta.  The very negative alpha in 2023-2025 is concerning.
*   **Beta:** Generally positive, indicating that NOC's price tends to move in the same direction as the market. The beta is trending downward, suggesting the stock is becoming less sensitive to broader market movements.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** The market capitalization has generally increased over the periods, indicating that the company has grown in size.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 558.0
*   **Last-market:** price': 558.0, 'previousClose': 558.0, 'change': 0.0}
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 560.858
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 580.2647
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 589.4119

**Analysis:**

NOC's price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This is generally considered a bearish signal, suggesting a potential downtrend. The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day moving average, which is also below the 60-day moving average, further confirming the bearish trend.
The ‘change’ is 0.0, so there is no special issue, such as a sharp rebound or sharp fall, to consider.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 17.42
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.45
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Disparity Change:** -1.3 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -283.6% (Long-term relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 17.42 indicates that NOC is significantly oversold. This could suggest a potential for a short-term bounce, but it's important to consider this in the context of the other indicators.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the bearish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The hybrid signal recommendation is to allocate 100% cash to buy 1 share, indicating a very safe position based on an MRI of 0.90. The monthly investment suggestion is to invest 0.8% of the total investment, with a cash ratio of 0% on 2025-10-01.
*   **Relative Disparity Change:** The negative change in relative disparity confirms the short-term underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-283.6%) is a major red flag.  It suggests that, based on current trends, the model predicts significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 even with long-term dollar-cost averaging.

*   **Negative Signals:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial negative disparity. Recent price action is bearish, with the price below key moving averages. The extremely negative expected return is a significant concern. High MDD and negative recent alphas highlight the risks.
*   **Positive Signals:** Analyst consensus remains a "Buy" with a potential upside based on target prices. Revenue and profit margins have been strong, although with some variability. The digital transformation initiatives suggest potential for future growth.
*   **Key Considerations:** The geopolitical environment and defense spending trends could be tailwinds for Northrop Grumman. However, the company faces challenges related to execution, cost control, and competition.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data provided, a cautious approach to NOC is warranted. While analyst opinions and some financial metrics are positive, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the alarming negative expected return are serious red flags. Investors should carefully consider the risks and potential rewards before investing in NOC, and closely monitor the company's performance and industry trends. The strong oversold condition (RSI of 17.42) suggests a potential for a short-term bounce, but this should not be mistaken for a long-term recovery without further confirmation.
