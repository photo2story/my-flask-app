**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Summary:** NOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While recent news indicates a potential positive catalyst (B-21 deal), concerns regarding valuation, political risks, and negative divergence signals, as well as insider selling, weigh on the stock. The extremely negative expected return is a major concern. Financials are stable for revenue and profitability, although ROE is volatile.
*   **Recommendation:** Based on the provided data, caution is advised. The negative expected return, divergence from the S&P 500, and valuation concerns warrant a cautious approach. Further research is needed to assess the long-term impact of the potential B-21 contract and to understand the underlying reasons for the poor expected return and volatile ROE.
