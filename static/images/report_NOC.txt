| 2023-2025  | -5.0%  | 82.1% | -69.0% | 0.1  | 80.1   |

*Analysis:*

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate has varied significantly, showing periods of strong growth (e.g., 2015-2017, 2019-2021) and decline (e.g., 2016-2018, 2018-2020, 2022-2025).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses during downturns.  This suggests high volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, a measure of outperformance against a benchmark, is frequently negative, suggesting underperformance. In recent periods (2020-2023), Alpha improved, but has since become significantly negative again (2022-2025).
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally low, indicating NOC is less volatile than the market (Beta = 1). The recent Beta figures are very close to zero, indicating very low correlation with the market. This could be due to the market going up while NOC goes down.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization generally increased over time, with some fluctuations.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 559.52
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 559.52, Previous Close: 564.19, Change: -0.83
*   **5-day SMA:** 567.60
*   **20-day SMA:** 560.71
*   **60-day SMA:** 581.61

*Analysis:*

*   The current price is below both the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This *could* suggest a short-term downtrend, but depends on broader market context.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, but both are below the 60-day SMA. This implies a potential weakening of any recent upward momentum.

**3) Technical Indicators and Divergence**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 42.45
*   **PPO:** 0.37
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (4 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_2.31 Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 5.2 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -120.2%

*Analysis:*

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests moderate risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 42.45 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The Positive Price Oscillator (PPO) at 0.37 is close to zero and may indicate little momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying with all available cash. This signal points to "very safe", seemingly conflicting with the expected return, risk profile and MDD.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests some short-term positive movement compared to VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return of -120.2% is very concerning and suggests the algorithm expects continued underperformance relative to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Earnings Release Date:** Northrop Grumman announced its Q4 and full-year 2025 earnings release date.
*   **Institutional Selling:** Texas Permanent School Fund Corp sold shares of NOC.
*   **Valuation Assessments:** Articles discuss reassessing NOC's valuation after a recent pullback, some suggesting it's time to sell, others reassessing after a strong year.
*   **Options Strategy:** An article discusses using options to "YieldBoost" NOC.

*Analysis:*

*   The news is mixed. An upcoming earnings release can be a catalyst for price movement (positive or negative).
*   Institutional selling can sometimes create downward pressure, but the amount sold (5,342 shares) is likely small relative to NOC's overall float.
*   The differing opinions on valuation (sell vs. reassess) highlight the uncertainty surrounding NOC's current price.

*Analysis:*

*   Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating for NOC.
*   The average target price of $662.68 represents a significant upside from the current price of $559.52. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty among analysts.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Based on the provided data, Northrop Grumman (NOC) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Underperformance:** NOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The -120% projected return indicates the AI thinks this underperformance will continue.
*   **Volatility:**  The high Maximum Drawdown figures show it to be a volatile stock.
*   **Technicals:** The price is below key moving averages, suggesting short-term downward pressure. The RSI is neutral.
*   **News & Sentiment:** Recent news is mixed, with both positive and negative articles appearing. Analyst ratings are generally positive, but with a wide range of target prices.
*   **Financials:** Revenue and profit margins are generally strong, but with some recent fluctuations.

**Overall Assessment:**

The current data paints a cautious picture of NOC. While analysts remain generally optimistic, the stock's underperformance, high volatility, and somewhat concerning technical indicators suggest that potential investors should proceed with caution. The extremely negative expected return from the AI model is a major red flag.

Further investigation is warranted to understand the factors driving the underperformance and the validity of the -120% projected return. Factors to investigate:

*   **Industry-Specific Headwinds:** Are there industry-specific issues (e.g., changing government spending priorities) affecting NOC?
*   **Company-Specific Issues:** Are there internal issues (e.g., project delays, cost overruns) impacting NOC's performance?
*   **Duplicate data on 2025-10-21** This might be an error in the model.

Before making any investment decision, carefully consider your risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence.
