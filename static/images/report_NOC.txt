    *   Relative Divergence: 0.9 (indicating that the current divergence is near the maximum observed in the past)

*   **Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|------|--------|

| 2020-2022  | 18.0%  | 79.9%  | 19.0%   | 0.3  | 78.1   |

| 2023-2025  | -3.0%  | 82.1%  | -67.0%  | 0.1  | 81.4   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Underperformance:** NOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period. The large negative divergence confirms this. The relative divergence being high suggests this underperformance is near its worst point within the observed range.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, especially in recent years. The data might be faulty (having betas of 0.0 and 0.1 makes little sense). Usually, this means that NOC's price movements are less correlated with the overall market (VOO) returns.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is mostly negative, indicating underperformance relative to the expected return based on its beta. The recent years show some positive Alpha, but the last entry with Alpha of -67% is notably bad.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating substantial potential losses during downturns in those periods, despite the security being in a defensive sector.
    *   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has been inconsistent, with periods of high growth followed by periods of negative growth.
    *   **Cap:** The company's capitalization has grown.
