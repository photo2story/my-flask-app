*   **60-day SMA:** 577.8235

**Analysis:** The stock price has experienced a positive change of 2.71% in the last market day. The 5-day and 20-day SMAs are below the current price, which could be a bullish signal suggesting upward momentum. The 60-day SMA is slightly above the current price.

**3) Technical Indicators and Divergence**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 63.85 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.31
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.9% (+): Short-term increase (단기상승)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -134.9%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment risk.
*   The RSI indicates the stock is nearing overbought conditions.
*   The hybrid signal recommends buying, suggesting a positive outlook, but the small number of shares (1) indicates a cautious approach.
*   The recent increase in relative divergence suggests short-term upward momentum.
*   **Most alarmingly, the Expected Return is extremely negative (-134.9%). This is a major red flag, suggesting that long-term investment from this point is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.** This should be heavily considered.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive News:**
    *   Potential $100B+ B-21 production deal.
    *   Evaluating valuation after new high-profile defense contracts.
    *   Shares purchased by Merit Financial Group LLC.
*   **Negative News/Concerns:**
    *   China sanctions U.S. defense companies, including Northrop Grumman.
    *   Insider Sale: CVP & Pres. Mission Systems of $NOC Sells 84 Shares
    *   Explosions heard in Venezuelan Capital.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. Positive developments such as the potential B-21 deal and new contracts are countered by concerns about Chinese sanctions. It is worth noting that the Insider Sale of shares can sometimes be considered a negative sign, however it only encompasses 84 shares, so it is most likely not representative of a significant belief that the company will underperform. The event in Venezuela is unlikely to have an impact on Northrop Grumman.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Mixed
*   **Target Price:** Average $662.68 (Upside potential from current price)

**Analysis:**  Analysts see potential upside, but the lack of specific ratings and changes makes it difficult to assess the strength of their convictions.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

NOC is a company with a strong position in the aerospace and defense industry, reflected in its revenue and market capitalization. However, the data suggests several causes for concern:

*   **Significant Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** NOC has substantially underperformed the market benchmark, and this trend is reflected in its negative alpha.
*   **Highly Negative Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return of -134.9% is the most alarming indicator, suggesting significant potential losses if investing long-term at the current price.
*   **Volatile Returns & High Drawdowns:** The wide range in CAGR and significant MDD figures indicate a risky investment.
*   **Mixed News:** While new contracts provide optimism, sanctions from China present a potential challenge.
*   **Technical Indicators:** RSI approaching overbought, but the hybrid signal offers a buy recommendation, but the high MRI indicates medium risk.
*   **Analyst Upside Potential:** The average target price suggests potential upside, but the lack of detailed ratings limits the conviction.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the information provided, a cautious approach to investing in NOC is warranted. While the company has positive aspects, such as steady revenue and potential upside from analyst targets, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, highly negative expected return, volatile returns, and news of Chinese sanctions raise serious concerns. Further research and careful consideration of individual risk tolerance are essential before making any investment decisions.
