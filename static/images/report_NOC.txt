*   **PPO:** The PPO is slightly positive, signaling a short-term bullish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying 100% of available cash, suggesting a bullish outlook based on the algorithm's criteria. The "very safe" designation seems at odds with other indicators, highlighting a potential discrepancy or differing risk tolerance within the model.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend relative to the S&P 500, but doesn't negate the overall underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return of -120.2% is a significant red flag. It suggests that, based on the model's calculations, the stock is significantly overvalued or facing severe headwinds in the long term.

**9) Comprehensive Summary:**

NOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a current divergence of -52.2%. While recent news suggests potential value after price pullbacks and analysts have a buy consensus, several concerning factors exist. The historical Alpha/Beta analysis indicates underperformance relative to the market and high Maximum Drawdowns, suggesting high risk. The model's projected Expected Return of -120.2% is a strong warning sign. While the RSI is approaching overbought levels and the short-term trend is slightly bullish, the long-term outlook seems uncertain based on the data.  The strong and consistent revenue and profit margins are a positive, but the fluctuations in ROE and the negative expected return are significant red flags. The Texas Permanent School Fund Corp's sale of shares is a concern.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the information provided, a cautious approach to investing in Northrop Grumman is warranted. While some indicators show short-term positive signals, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the extremely negative expected return, and the high maximum drawdowns suggest substantial risks. Further investigation is needed to understand the factors contributing to the negative outlook before making any investment decisions. It's important to carefully weigh the analyst consensus against the model's projections and the historical performance data.
