*   **Alpha:** Often negative, implying underperformance relative to its benchmark. In the most recent period, alpha is sharply negative.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** Around 50 is considered neutral; neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** Negative PPO values indicates short-term selling pressure, relative to previous activity.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** A buy signal with no allocation for cash (100% allocated), and with high MRI suggests high faith in the stock and that the downturn is not a major concern.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence further supports the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The *very* negative expected return is a major red flag. It implies significant concerns about future performance.

*   **Valuation Opportunity?**: Some articles suggest that the recent price decline *may* present a valuation opportunity.
*   **Dividend Announcement**: Consistent dividends may provide some stability and income for investors.
*   **Bull Case Theory:** Countering sentiment suggests a bull case theory and opportunity for growth.
*   **NOC Outperforming Dow?**: Mixed sentiment as some articles suggest NOC is *not* outperforming the Dow.
*   **Reasons to Sell:** Articles mention reasons to sell NOC and buy an alternate stock.

**Analysis:**  The news is mixed. While some articles point to a potential buying opportunity due to a recent price decline and a solid dividend, others suggest selling NOC. The mixed news reinforces the high risk and uncertainty surrounding the stock.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~2.09 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Target Price:** $663.21 (Average), $770.00 (High), $533.00 (Low)

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue    |
|------------|------|------------|

| 2025-10-21 | 7.02 | 10.00 B$   |

**Analysis:** Revenue has been reasonably consistent, although not showing strong growth, while EPS has fluctuated. The significant dip in EPS in April 2025 raises concerns. There is a repeat of 2025-10-21; it's likely the first entry should be 2024-10-24 for a contiguous historical dataset.

*   **Mixed Signals:** Analyst ratings are still generally a "Buy," but target prices suggest little to no upside, and news is conflicting.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data provided, there are substantial concerns about investing in Northrop Grumman at this time. While some analysts maintain a "Buy" rating and the dividend offers some stability, the negative divergence from the S&P 500, the recent decline in stock price, the concerning trends in EPS, profit margin, and ROE, and the **very negative expected return** outweigh the positives. The news is also contradictory. A more thorough investigation and a careful consideration of your risk tolerance are crucial before making any investment decision.
