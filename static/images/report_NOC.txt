**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | -1.0%  | 17.7% | -63.0% | 0.1  | 81.6   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha values in most periods (especially recently) suggest that NOC has underperformed relative to its expected return based on its beta. This underperformance is particularly pronounced in the 2023-2025 period. The only periods with positive Alpha (2020-2022 and 2021-2023) correlate with generally strong market conditions.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values have decreased over time, indicating that NOC's price movements have become less correlated with the broader market. A beta of 0.1 for 2023-2025 suggests that NOC is now significantly less volatile than the S&P 500.
*   **CAGR:** Variable CAGR figures indicate inconsistent growth. Recent periods (2022-2025) show negative to near-zero growth.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown figures are relatively stable, suggesting a consistent level of risk (downside volatility).

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 585.66
*   **Previous Close:** 570.21
*   **Change:** 2.71%
*   **5-day SMA:** 577.118
*   **20-day SMA:** 568.033
*   **60-day SMA:** 577.8235

**Analysis:**

The current price is above the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a short-term upward trend. The recent price increase of 2.71% suggests a positive movement in the stock.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 63.85
*   **PPO:** 0.31
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.6 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -236.1% (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point).

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** A value of 63.85 is approaching the overbought threshold (typically 70), suggesting the stock might be due for a pullback.
*   **PPO:** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) being positive indicates that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, which is generally a bullish signal.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying 90% of cash available, while maintaining a 0% cash ratio in the future.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** Confirms a recent short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return is highly concerning and suggests poor long-term prospects relative to the S&P 500 *if the model used to compute this is accurate*. This is a strong red flag.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2025-10-21 | 7.69 | 10.42 B$     |
| 2025-07-22 | 8.17 | 10.35 B$     |
| 2025-04-22 | 3.33 | 9.47 B$      |

| 2025-10-21 | 7.02 | 10.00 B$     |

**Analysis:**

Earnings per share (EPS) and revenue have fluctuated. EPS showed a significant dip in Q1 2025 (3.33) before recovering. Revenue has been relatively consistent, hovering around $10 billion, except for the dip in Q1 2025. The duplicated 2025-10-21 data with identical EPS and Revenue values is likely a data error, so only the earlier instance is considered.

*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been increasing overall. ROE (Return on Equity) has fluctuated, with a low in Q1 2025, suggesting less efficient use of equity in that quarter.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

Northrop Grumman (NOC) has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. While recent news indicates potential contract wins and institutional buying, there are also concerns about potential policy changes impacting defense contractors, an insider sale, and a high degree of uncertainty among analysts.

**Key Points:**

*   **Underperformance:** NOC has significantly lagged the S&P 500, with a substantial negative divergence. The negative Alpha values confirm this underperformance relative to its beta.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators suggest a short-term upward trend, but the RSI is approaching overbought levels. The significantly negative expected return is a major red flag.
*   **Financial Health:** Revenue and profit margins have been relatively stable, but the dip in Q1 2025 is a concern. ROE has also fluctuated.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** While the average target price suggests potential upside, the wide range indicates a lack of strong conviction among analysts.
*   **Trump's target:** Trump's policy to reduce the earnings of defense contractors will lower investor's expectations for Northrop Grumman.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the data provided, a cautious approach to NOC is warranted. While there are some positive signs, the underperformance, negative expected return, and mixed news create significant risks. Potential investors should conduct thorough due diligence and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in NOC. The significantly negative "Expected Return (%)" warrants extreme caution and a deeper investigation into the methodology behind that calculation.
