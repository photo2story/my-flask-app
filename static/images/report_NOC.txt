While analysts are generally positive, the stock has significantly underperformed the market, and the negative expected return suggests this underperformance could continue.  The high volatility, insider selling, and earnings concerns warrant careful consideration before investing. Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and the drivers behind the negative expected return is strongly recommended.
