**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly. Recent periods show negative or low growth.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values, suggesting significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is volatile but mostly negative in recent periods. This indicates underperformance relative to its benchmark (S&P 500) after accounting for risk.
*   **Beta:**  Generally below 1, indicating that NOC is theoretically less volatile than the market (S&P 500). However, given the high MDD, this might be misleading.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has generally increased over time, but recent performance has not been reflected in higher stock prices.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 566.70
*   **Previous Close:** 567.35
*   **Change:** -0.11
*   **5-day SMA:** 565.77
*   **20-day SMA:** 571.25
*   **60-day SMA:** 587.45

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly down from the previous close. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, suggesting a short-term downward trend and weakness.

**3. Technical Indicators & Market Risk**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 39.51 (Approaching oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound)
*   **PPO:** 0.10 (Suggests potential upward momentum, as the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-20)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 5.3 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -70.2% (Expected underperformance relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**  The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is approaching oversold, which *could* indicate a buying opportunity. However, the extremely negative Expected Return is a significant red flag. The hybrid signal suggests a bullish stance with a high buy ratio and the short-term increase in divergence also signals short-term bullishness.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **[2025-11-22] Northrop Grumman (NOC): Assessing Value After Recent 5% Pullback in Share Price:** Indicates a recent price decline and potential consideration of undervaluation.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. While the dividend announcement and Franklin Resources' increased holdings are positive, the sale by Ensign Peak and focus on a recent price pullback suggest caution. The upcoming earnings results are a key event to watch.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (2.10)
*   **Target Price:** 667.21 (average)

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating and a target price significantly above the current price.
