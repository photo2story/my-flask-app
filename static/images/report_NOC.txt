*   **Beta:**  Beta generally ranges from 0.0 to 0.9, indicating that NOC's price is less sensitive to market movements than the overall market. The beta decreasing towards 0 in recent years suggests a lower correlation with the market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 572.25

*   **20-day SMA:** 567.3912
*   **60-day SMA:** 586.3509

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is above both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend.
*   However, the price is still below the 60-day SMA, indicating that the longer-term trend might still be downward or consolidating.
*   The 'change' value suggests a slight upward movement from the previous close, but more context is needed to determine the significance of this fluctuation.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium to High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 54.13
*   **PPO:** 0.3093
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (2 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 5.3 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -70.2

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests that, based on the model used, the stock is moderately risky.
*   The RSI indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   The PPO suggests a possible uptrend (positive), but it's a weak signal as it is close to zero.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends a buy based on a model that includes MRI.
*   The "단기상승" indicates short-term upward momentum, which aligns with the recent price being above the 5 and 20 day SMAs.
*   **The expected return of -70.2% is a very strong negative signal.  This suggests that, according to the model, the stock is significantly overvalued or facing significant headwinds.**

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **State Board of Administration of Florida Retirement System increased its holdings.** This could be a positive signal, indicating confidence in the company.
*   **Northrop Grumman anticipates growth in Europe even after the Russia-Ukraine conflict.** This suggests optimism about future international business.
*   **Evaluating Hidden Value as Defense Giant's Shares Consolidate After Strong YTD Gains:** This suggests that while the stock has had gains this year, there are still potential value opportunities.
*   **NOC Stock Price Prediction 2025, 2026 & 2030: Analyst Targets & Quantum Computing Outlook.** This suggests future growth potential.

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.10)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 667.21 / 770.00 / 533.00

**Analysis:**  Despite the concerning technical indicators and underperformance, analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating on NOC. The average target price of $667.21 suggests considerable upside potential from the current price of $572.25. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices reflects uncertainty among analysts.  The lack of recent rating changes indicated that analysts opinions have been relatively stable.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Underperformance:** NOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility as seen in the Maximum Drawdown figures.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The short-term moving averages suggest an upward trend, but the longer-term SMA is above the current price. RSI is neutral. PPO is weakly positive.
*   **Negative Outlook:** The expected return of -70.2% is a significant red flag, suggesting the model views NOC as overvalued or facing significant future challenges.
*   **Analyst Optimism:**  Despite the negative technical and model-based outlook, analysts maintain a positive "Buy" rating and see significant upside potential.
*   **Financial Health:**  Revenue is stable, profit margins are generally healthy, and equity is increasing, reflecting a solid financial base.
*   **Conflicting Factors:** Recent news is mixed, with some positive developments (analyst optimism, new contracts), and some potentially negative (Prudential reducing holdings).

**Conclusion:**

NOC presents a complex picture. While financially stable with positive analyst sentiment, it is underperforming the market, displaying high volatility, and faces a very negative future return projection from one model. This discrepancy between analyst optimism and the model's pessimistic outlook should be investigated. Consider:

*   **The validity of the model generating the -70.2% expected return.** What factors is it using? Are these factors relevant to NOC?
*   **The reasons behind the analyst "Buy" ratings.** What growth catalysts are they anticipating?
*   **The current valuation of NOC relative to its peers in the defense industry.** Is it trading at a premium?
*   **A deeper dive into the causes of the lower profit margin and ROE in the quarter ending March 2025.**

Ultimately, an investment decision should weigh the analyst consensus and the company's fundamental strengths against the concerning technical indicators and the strongly negative expected return. Further investigation is needed to reconcile these conflicting signals.
