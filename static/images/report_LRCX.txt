Positive Alpha values indicate LRCX has generally outperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) for most periods, especially in the last reported period. A Beta around 1 suggests its price tends to move similarly to the overall market. The massive increase in market capitalization in the latest period likely reflects this strong performance.
