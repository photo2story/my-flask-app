**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** LRCX shows periods of very high growth (e.g., 2019-2021, 2023-2025) and periods of decline (2020-2022, 2021-2023, 2022-2024). This illustrates the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD figures are consistently high, reflecting the stock's volatility and sensitivity to market downturns or industry-specific challenges.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is positive in periods when LRCX significantly outperforms the market, indicating strong stock-specific drivers.  It's negative during periods of underperformance.  The high Alpha in the most recent period (2023-2025) is notable.

The positive PPO confirms bullish momentum.  The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend. The Hybrid Signal recommends a high allocation to the stock, aligning with the MRI. The 14.2% expected return is attractive for long-term investors.
