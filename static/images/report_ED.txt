The most recent earnings report (2024-08-01) shows that ED beat analyst estimates by 2 cents, exceeding expectations. However, the previous earnings report (2024-05-02) also showed a positive beat. This suggests that ED is consistently exceeding expectations, which could be a positive sign for future performance. 

**5. Overall Analysis:**

Despite ED's recent outperformance in earnings, its overall performance remains significantly lagging compared to the S&P 500. While its recent positive earnings and relatively strong technical indicators suggest a potential for near-term price appreciation, the overbought RSI suggests caution for investors. The significant negative relative divergence and the historical underperformance compared to the benchmark index also warrant careful consideration. 

**6. Conclusion:**

ED's recent positive earnings and technical indicators present a mixed picture for investors. While the company has shown strong performance in exceeding earnings estimates, its historical performance compared to the broader market remains a concern.  Investors should monitor the company's future earnings reports and market developments closely before making any investment decisions.
