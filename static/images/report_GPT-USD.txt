**6. Overall Analysis:**

GPT-USD exhibits extremely poor performance compared to the S&P 500, showing a massive cumulative return difference.

The projected zero excess return further reinforces the underperformance concerns. The absence of crucial information makes any investment recommendation extremely difficult.  Further investigation into the company's fundamentals, news, and analyst opinions is crucial before considering any investment.  The high RSI suggests caution is warranted in the short term.  Given the lack of data and substantial underperformance, further due diligence is strongly recommended.
