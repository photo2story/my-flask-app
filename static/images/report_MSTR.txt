The most significant change is the drastic improvement in EPS from Q2 2024 (-5.74) to Q3 2024 (-1.72), suggesting an improvement in the company's profitability. However, it is still operating at a loss.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

MSTR shows a significant long-term outperformance against the S&P 500, with a very high cumulative return.  However, the current price is trending downward and several key indicators (moving averages, PPO) reflect negative short-term momentum.  The recent earnings data show volatile EPS and a slightly declining profit margin, despite relatively stable revenue.  The high expected long-term return (46.7%) and oversold RSI suggest a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors, but the short-term outlook is bearish and caution is advised. The analysis is limited by missing data points and news, therefore external resources should be consulted for a comprehensive view.
