**0) Report in English**

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** Microstrategy Inc. is a company that acquires, holds, and sells bitcoin.
*   **Return Rates:**
    *   MSTR Cumulative Return: 421.82%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 102.21%
    *   Divergence: 319.6 (Relative Divergence: 30.0)

**Analysis:** MSTR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return. The divergence between MSTR and VOO is 319.6, and its relative divergence of 30 indicates that it's still performing lower than its peak performance.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | 424.0% | 83.2%  | 318.0%   | -0.1  | 44.3   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** A very high CAGR of 424.0% suggests substantial growth over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** A large MDD of 83.2% indicates very high risk and volatility. Investors could experience significant losses during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** A very high Alpha of 318.0% indicates the stock has significantly outperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500), suggesting the company has generated excess returns that are not explained by the market.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of -0.1 indicates the stock is inversely correlated to the market. In this case, it is a very weak, and even negligible, inverse correlation.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization is 44.3 Billion.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close Price: 155.61
*   Last Market Data: Price = 154.25, Previous Close = 155.6, Change = -0.87
*   5-day SMA: 157.28
*   20-day SMA: 170.698
*   60-day SMA: 225.6406

**Analysis:** The current price (154.25) is below all moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This suggests a recent downtrend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and the 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA, further confirming the downward trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.9 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 22.03
*   PPO: 0.428
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -2.3 (Decreasing)
*   Expected Return (%): 515.3%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.9 suggests the stock is considered a medium investment risk at this time.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 22.03 indicates the stock is oversold, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity. However, oversold conditions can persist.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 0.428 suggests the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which is not aligned with the current price action below its moving averages.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends using all available cash to buy. This is based on the MRI score.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent decrease in relative divergence indicates weakening performance compared to the comparison stock.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return of 515.3% should be viewed with skepticism. Such high returns are unlikely and would be associated with high risk.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Performance:** News articles highlight MicroStrategy's poor performance in 2025 ("Worst Performing Nasdaq-100 Stock").
*   **Bitcoin Purchases:** MicroStrategy continues to purchase Bitcoin, sometimes using share sales to fund these purchases. This strategy is controversial and scrutinized.
*   **Debt/Funding Concerns:** There are questions about how MicroStrategy will finance further Bitcoin purchases.
*   **Balance Sheet Strength:** One article suggests the balance sheet is still strong despite the Bitcoin strategy.

**Analysis:** Recent news paints a mixed picture. The continued investment in Bitcoin, funded by share sales, is a major theme. This strategy creates both potential upside (if Bitcoin rises) and downside (if Bitcoin falls or if investors dislike the strategy). The news articles suggest investor concerns about the sustainability of this strategy.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   Consensus: Strong Buy (Mean = 1.29)
*   Number of Opinions: 13
*   Target Price (avg/high/low): 489.62 / 705.00 / 229.00

**Analysis:** Despite the recent negative news, analyst consensus remains strongly bullish, with a "Strong Buy" rating and a high average target price significantly above the current price. This could indicate that analysts believe the company's Bitcoin strategy will eventually pay off, or that they are focused on a longer-term outlook.
The large spread between the high and low target prices (705.00 vs. 229.00) demonstrates a significant divergence in analyst opinions.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Microstrategy presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The company's stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but it has also experienced considerable volatility, as shown by its high MDD. The company's performance is tightly linked to the price of Bitcoin, making it effectively a leveraged Bitcoin play.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **High Risk:** High MDD, volatile EPS, and dependence on Bitcoin price make this a risky investment.
*   **High Potential Reward:** High CAGR, Alpha, and potential upside from Bitcoin price increases.
*   **Analyst Disagreement:** Strong Buy consensus contrasts with recent negative news, large difference between target prices.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** Oversold RSI potentially indicating a buying opportunity is countered by recent price declines.
*   **Controversial Strategy:** Funding Bitcoin purchases through share sales is a key risk.

**Recommendation:** Due to the high risk, this investment is suitable only for investors with a high risk tolerance and a strong belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. A potential investor should carefully consider their financial situation, investment goals, and understanding of the cryptocurrency market before investing in MSTR. The large target price range suggests considerable uncertainty among analysts.
