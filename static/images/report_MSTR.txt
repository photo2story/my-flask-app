**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
| --------- | ------- | ----- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| 2015-2017 | -25.0%  | 70.2% | -53.0%  | -0.1   | 3.8    |
| 2016-2018 | -19.0%  | 70.2% | -34.0%  | -0.1   | 3.7    |
| 2017-2019 | -25.0%  | 68.7% | -47.0%  | -0.1   | 4.1    |
| 2018-2020 | 78.0%   | 80.4% | 55.0%   | -0.2   | 11.2   |
| 2019-2021 | 122.0%  | 80.4% | 75.0%   | -0.6   | 15.7   |
| 2020-2022 | -16.0%  | 80.4% | -15.0%  | -0.2   | 4.1    |
| 2021-2023 | -1.0%   | 80.0% | -3.0%   | 1.4    | 18.1   |
| 2022-2024 | 716.0%  | 81.1% | 695.0%  | 1.5    | 83.2   |
| 2023-2025 | 422.0%  | 83.2% | 358.0%  | 2.2    | 45.5   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows wildly varying performance. Recent years (2022-2025) have seen massive growth, while earlier periods showed negative returns.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are extremely variable. The recent periods show very high alpha, reflecting strong outperformance.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values have shifted over time, trending upward and indicating a higher sensitivity to overall market movements. This increasing beta suggests that MSTR is now more correlated with the market than it has been historically.
*    **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated significantly, reflecting the company's volatile performance.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 158.24
*   **Previous Close:** 160.38
*   **Change:** -1.33
*   **5-day SMA:** 164.93
*   **20-day SMA:** 176.739
*   **60-day SMA:** 245.2718

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is below all three SMAs (5, 20, and 60 day). This suggests a downtrend in the short to medium term. The fact that the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA reinforces this bearish signal.
*   The negative change from the previous close and that it is below the 5-day SMA suggest potential further short-term decline.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Other Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 36.88
*   **PPO:** 0.1421
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -5.6 (downward trend)
*   **Expected Return:** 424.8%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 36.88 indicates that the stock is approaching oversold territory (below 30). This could suggest a potential buying opportunity, but further confirmation is needed.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) value of 0.1421 alone isn't particularly informative without historical context.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommending buying 100% of cash, with a "Very Safe" designation and a MRI of 0.90 is confusing, and probably not directly indicative of the hybrid model of Microstrategy.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence suggests short-term downward pressure.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (424.8%) should be viewed with skepticism. It is likely based on a model that heavily weighs recent performance and may not be sustainable.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Bitcoin Falters As Strategy's Buying Power Runs Low On Fuel**
*   **Michael Saylor Just Bought $1 Billion More Bitcoin. So Why Is MSTR Stock Still Down 39%?**
*   **Strategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin. It Isn’t Helping the Stock.**
*   **Peter Schiff Expects 50% MSTR Stock Crash and Bitcoin Below $50K**
*   **MSTR stock price may crash to $100 as dilution rises, mNAV nears negative**

**Analysis:**

*   The news headlines paint a concerning picture. The core issue appears to be the increasing correlation between MSTR's stock price and Bitcoin's price.
*   The news suggests that the market is questioning MSTR's strategy of aggressively buying Bitcoin, especially as Bitcoin's price shows signs of weakness.
*   The warnings of a potential stock price crash and negative mNAV (market-adjusted net asset value) are serious and warrant careful consideration.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Strong Buy (1.29 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 13
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 501.92 / High: 705.00 / Low: 229.00

**Analysis:**

*   Despite the concerning news, analysts still have a generally positive outlook on MSTR, with a "Strong Buy" consensus.
*   The wide range in target prices (229 to 705) indicates considerable uncertainty among analysts. This highlights the speculative nature of the stock.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| 2025-11-03 | 9.30  | 0.13 B$     |
| 2025-08-05 | 36.23 | 0.11 B$     |
| 2025-05-05 | -16.49 | 0.11 B$     |
| 2024-10-31 | -1.72  | 0.12 B$     |
| 2025-11-03 | -1.72  | 0.12 B$     |

**Analysis:**

*   EPS is highly variable, with both significant profits and losses in recent quarters.
*   Revenue has been relatively stable, remaining around $0.11B - $0.13B. This suggests that MSTR's revenue stream is not driving the large fluctuations in EPS. EPS is far more driven by Bitcoin holdings.
*   Earnings growth is inconsistent and heavily influenced by factors outside of MSTR's core business operations.

| 2024-09-30   | $3.77B     | -9.01%      |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue is stable and does not indicate substantial growth.
*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are consistently high, which is a positive sign.
*   **Equity:** Equity has increased dramatically, likely due to the appreciation of Bitcoin holdings. This increase in equity is not necessarily a reflection of the underlying health of the company's core business.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity is highly volatile, reflecting the fluctuations in Bitcoin's price.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

MSTR presents a very high-risk, high-reward investment profile. Its performance is overwhelmingly tied to the price of Bitcoin, making it a leveraged play on the cryptocurrency.

*   **Strengths:**
    *   Strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   High profit margins.
    *   Analyst consensus is still generally positive.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Extremely high volatility, as evidenced by the Maximum Drawdown.
    *   Increasing Beta, suggesting high market sensitivity.
    *   Dependence on Bitcoin makes it susceptible to cryptocurrency market swings.
    *   Concerning news headlines, including potential stock price crash warnings and concerns about dilution.
    *   Inconsistent earnings driven by Bitcoin holdings, not core business performance.
    *   Unsustainable and highly volatile ROE, driven primarily by Bitcoin price fluctuations.

**Recommendation:**

Given the high degree of risk and dependence on Bitcoin, MSTR is suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a strong belief in the long-term prospects of Bitcoin. Investors should be prepared for significant price swings and potential losses. The current technical indicators, coupled with negative news sentiment, suggest caution in the short term. Thorough due diligence is essential before investing in MSTR.
