## Microstrategy Inc. (MSTR) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Microstrategy Inc. (MSTR) is a business intelligence company that provides software and services for enterprise data analytics.  The provided data shows a significantly higher cumulative return for MSTR compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  However, this outperformance is highly volatile, as indicated by the wide range in relative divergence.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this performance.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

* **MSTR Cumulative Return:** 1551.71%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 91.19%
* **Return Difference:** 1460.51%  (This is the difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 70.8% (Indicates MSTR's performance is in the upper 70.8th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This is not a measure of future outperformance.)


The provided Alpha and Beta values show significant volatility and inconsistent relationships with the market.  High Beta values (e.g., 9.1, 12.7) in certain years indicate high market sensitivity, while others (e.g., 3.0, 3.1) suggest lower sensitivity.  The extremely high CAGR values in recent years (1455%, 1496%) are likely unsustainable. Negative Alpha in most years indicates underperformance compared to the market benchmarks, despite the high overall cumulative return.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $324.59
* **Last Market Price:** $290.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $327.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $291.18
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $317.76

The price is currently above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it is below the 5-day moving average, indicating potential short-term weakness. The recent price change of 0.2 suggests very little recent movement which should be viewed in context with other indicators.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 59.32 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 2.67 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.3% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 87.1% (Over two years, relative to the S&P 500).  This requires a cautious assessment due to the high volatility shown in the historical data.

The relatively small price change in `Last-market` does not indicate significant recent volatility, negating the need for additional commentary on rapid price movements. The high expected return needs to be considered alongside the high risk implied by past volatility and beta.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$1.72   | $0.12 B     |

The company is currently reporting significant net losses (negative EPS). Revenue remains relatively stable, but the substantial and volatile losses raise serious concerns about the company's financial health and the sustainability of its stock price.  The duplicate date in the table requires clarification.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin |

| 2023-12-31  | $2.16B      | 4.12%        |


Despite relatively high profit margins, the negative Return on Equity (ROE) in most recent quarters is alarming.  The substantial fluctuation in equity further emphasizes the high risk associated with this investment.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

MSTR has demonstrated exceptionally high cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500.  However, this performance is characterized by extreme volatility, significant losses in recent earnings, and inconsistent relationships with market movements.  The high expected return should be viewed cautiously in light of the significant financial risks.  The negative ROE and large fluctuations in equity raise significant concerns about the long-term sustainability of the company's financial health.   Further investigation is needed to determine if the current high stock price is justified and whether the high expected return is realistic given the high risk profile.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate date in earnings) also raise questions about data reliability.
