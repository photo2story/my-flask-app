**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values reveal a highly volatile and market-insensitive stock, especially in recent years.  Notice the significant jump in both CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) from 2018-2020 and onwards, along with high beta values, indicative of significant market risk.  High alpha values in the last two years (2.3 and 1.3) strongly suggests significant outperformance compared to the market during this specific time period.  However, high beta and significant swings in the alpha show volatility that must be considered.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B)  |
|------------|----------|----------|--------|--------|---------|
| 2015-2017  | -17.0%    | 29.8%    | -0.1   | 3.5    |         |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Price:** $315.32
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $307.52
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $296.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $317.61

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance at that level.  The recent price change of $3.04 represents a small but positive uptick.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 61.85 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.63 (Positive; bullish signal)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -8.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 102.5% (Significant outperformance relative to S&P 500 over the long term, based on the provided data.  Consider this projection highly speculative).

The positive PPO and relatively high RSI indicate potential for further upward movement, although the negative relative divergence change suggests some caution. The recent price increase should be viewed in context with the relative divergence numbers, and does not negate the risk of a potential correction if the overall market trend shifts negatively.  The high expected return is subject to substantial uncertainty due to the volatility of the stock and the inherent limitations of any long-term projection.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

MSTR's recent earnings show significant losses (negative EPS).  Revenue remains relatively flat, indicating potential concerns about profitability and financial sustainability.

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |

| 2024-10-31 | -1.72    | $0.12 B     |

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information reveals high profit margins but low or negative ROE. This might indicate high operating leverage, where small revenue changes cause larger profit margin swings. However, the negative ROE highlights concerns about the return generated on shareholder equity.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

MSTR has demonstrated exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, particularly in recent years.  However, this performance is accompanied by significant volatility and high risk, as reflected in the high beta and large swings in both alpha and Maximum Drawdown.  The recent earnings indicate concerns around profitability despite high profit margins, and the negative ROE raises questions about the efficiency of capital utilization.  While the high expected return is enticing,  investors should be aware of the substantial risk involved and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in MSTR.  Further investigation into the drivers behind the recent surge in performance and the sustainability of the business model is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests that while the past performance has been impressive, future performance is far from certain given the inherent volatility of the stock and the current financial picture.
