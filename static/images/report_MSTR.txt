**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |

| 2019-2021  | 122.0% | 80.4% | 75.0%  | -0.6 | 15.7  |
| 2020-2022  | -16.0% | 80.4% | -15.0% | -0.2 | 4.1   |
| 2021-2023  | -1.0%  | 80.0% | -3.0%  | 1.4  | 18.1  |

| 2023-2025  | 453.0% | 83.2% | 389.0% | 2.2  | 48.1  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates wildly, showing periods of significant losses and massive gains, heavily influenced by Bitcoin's price swings.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Also highly volatile, mirroring the CAGR. High alpha in recent years suggests strong performance independent of the market (due to Bitcoin). Negative alpha indicates underperformance compared to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:**  Low negative betas in earlier periods suggest Microstrategy moved *opposite* to the market slightly.  The recent positive Beta values (1.4, 1.5, and 2.2) indicate that MSTR's price is now moving *in the same direction* as the market, and at a higher magnitude (it's more volatile than the market).
*   **Cap (B):**  Market capitalization has grown significantly, particularly in the last few years, reflecting the impact of Bitcoin holdings on the company's valuation.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 167.5
*   **Previous Close:** 162.08
*   **Change:** 3.34
*   **5-day SMA:** 174.794
*   **20-day SMA:** 180.473
*   **60-day SMA:** 250.9268

**Analysis:**

The current price is below the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This suggests a short-term downtrend. The recent price increase (change of 3.34 from the previous close) could signal a potential reversal, but it's too early to confirm. The large difference between the 60-day SMA and the current price indicates a significant price drop in the last two months.

**3) RSI, PPO Index, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 46.55 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.71 (Bullish, but weakening)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 350.0 (Long-term, >2 years)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is near 50, indicating neutral momentum, neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:**  Positive but relatively low, suggesting a bullish trend but with weakening momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Strongly recommends buying and deploying all cash (invest fully).

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출       |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-11-03 | 9.30   | 0.13 B$    |

**Analysis:**

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):**  Shows significant volatility. Recent quarters have been profitable, but prior periods show losses.

*   **Revenue:**  Consistent, as seen in the earnings analysis.
*   **Profit Margin:** Exceptionally high and stable, suggesting a strong core business (though this is less impactful than Bitcoin valuation).
*   **Equity:**  Has grown dramatically, likely due to Bitcoin appreciation being reflected on the balance sheet.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):**  Highly volatile, driven by both profit and equity fluctuations. The recent positive ROE reflects the improved profitability and increased equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

MSTR is a high-risk, high-reward stock closely tied to the price of Bitcoin.

*   **Strengths:** Massive outperformance of the market (driven by Bitcoin), strong analyst ratings, very high expected returns, high profit margins, consistent revenue, and potentially very high potential upside.
*   **Weaknesses/Risks:** Extremely high volatility (MDD), dependence on Bitcoin, recent short-term negative price action, potential bearish sentiment in options markets, and fluctuations in equity/ROE.
*   **Investment Recommendation:** The MRI indicates a medium investment, whereas the analyst consensus is strong buy. However, the actual investment recommendation should be tailored to your risk tolerance and investment horizon. If you are bullish on Bitcoin and can tolerate substantial volatility, MSTR may be an attractive investment. If you are risk-averse or have a short-term investment horizon, it is best to avoid MSTR.
