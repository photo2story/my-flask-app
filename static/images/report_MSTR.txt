The high expected return comes with substantial volatility and dependence on the price of Bitcoin. Investors should weigh the potential rewards against the inherent risks before making an investment decision. A more conservative investor may want to wait for a more stable price trend or a more positive outlook for Bitcoin before considering an investment in MSTR.
