## MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) Stock Report

**1. Performance Summary and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

MicroStrategy Inc. is a publicly traded company that provides business intelligence, mobile software, and cloud-based services.

The cumulative return of MSTR is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  MSTR shows a cumulative return of 1770.64%, while VOO shows a cumulative return of 120.36%. The difference is 1650.28%.  The provided relative divergence of 79.5% indicates that MSTR's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been exceptionally high compared to its historical range of divergence.  However, this high relative divergence should be interpreted cautiously, as it reflects past performance and doesn't guarantee future returns.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant volatility, ranging from -24% to 1790%. The high CAGR in recent years (2022-2025) is largely responsible for the dramatic difference in cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500.  The Alpha consistently at 0.0 suggests that the stock's performance may not be attributable to manager skill and is largely influenced by market factors (as reflected in Beta).  The Beta values fluctuate but generally remain high, suggesting high volatility in line with overall market trends.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $389.10
* **5-day Moving Average:** $371.08
* **20-day Moving Average:** $342.41
* **60-day Moving Average:** $339.88

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  However, the recent price change of -1.87% indicates a slight downward correction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 61.49 -  Slightly above neutral (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.86 - Positive value suggests a bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +13.1% - Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.

The negative price change (-1.87%) from the previous close is relatively small and doesn't suggest a significant downward correction or "crash".  The expected return of 35.8% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is significant but should be considered with caution due to the volatility inherent in this stock.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility and consistent net losses (negative EPS). Revenue remains relatively stable, but the company consistently operates at a net loss.  This warrants further investigation into the company's business model and future prospects to determine if the high stock price is justified.  Note that there are duplicate entries for October 31, 2024.  Clarification is needed on this data inconsistency.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

MSTR has shown exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, primarily driven by strong performance in recent years. However, this performance is accompanied by high volatility and significant inconsistencies in earnings and ROE. The consistently negative EPS and fluctuating ROE raise concerns about the long-term financial health of the company.  The high profit margins are noteworthy but need to be considered in context of the overall financial performance.  Further due diligence is crucial before making any investment decisions, focusing on the sustainability of the company's business model and its capacity to generate consistent profits.  The projected long-term return should be treated with considerable caution given the inherent risk associated with MSTRâ€™s volatility.  The high relative divergence to the S&P 500 should be viewed cautiously, as it's a reflection of past performance, not a guarantee of future success.
