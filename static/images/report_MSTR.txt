The table is:

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2020-2022  | -16.0% | 80.4% | -15.0% | -0.2 | 4.1    |

| 2023-2025  | 413.0% | 83.2% | 346.0% | 2.2  | 44.7   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate varies wildly, with significant negative returns in some periods and explosive growth in others, especially recently. This highlights the stock's volatility.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha figures are generally negative in earlier periods, suggesting underperformance relative to a benchmark. However, recent years show extremely high Alpha, indicating substantial outperformance, again likely tied to Bitcoin.  Alpha measures the investment's performance on a risk-adjusted basis. A positive alpha indicates the investment has performed better than expected given its level of risk.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values fluctuate. The recent Beta values above 1 indicate that the stock is more volatile than the market (S&P 500) and tends to amplify market movements.  A beta of 1 suggests the investment's price will move with the market. A beta greater than 1 suggests the investment's price will be more volatile than the market. A beta less than 1 suggests the investment's price will be less volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization fluctuates, reflecting the changing valuation of the company.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 155.61
*   **Previous Close:** 155.38
*   **Change:** 0.15
*   **5-day SMA:** 157.28
*   **20-day SMA:** 170.698
*   **60-day SMA:** 225.6406

**Analysis:**

The current price is below all moving averages, which *could* signal a short-term downward trend.  The price has been declining recently. The 5-day SMA being below the 20-day SMA and 60-day SMA also confirms the current downtrend. The small change in price from the previous close is relatively insignificant.

**3) Index Analysis**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 22.03
*   **PPO:** 0.428
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Very Safe)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -0.2 (Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** 493.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, a relatively bullish signal.
*   **RSI:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 22.03 indicates the stock is heavily oversold, which *could* suggest a potential rebound. However, oversold conditions can persist.
*   **PPO:** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) of 0.428 is positive. The PPO is a momentum oscillator used in technical analysis to measure the difference between two moving averages as a percentage of the larger moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "Buy 100% (Very Safe)" is a conflicting signal given the other indicators. This is likely based on the long-term potential and the high MRI.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence indicates a recent short-term downward trend relative to the comparison stock (VOO).
*   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return (493.6%) is optimistic, especially considering the recent volatility. It suggests that the analysis believes MSTR is significantly undervalued.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Bitcoin Purchases:** MSTR continues to actively purchase Bitcoin, signaling confidence in the cryptocurrency's long-term value.
*   **Performance in 2025:** News indicates that MSTR was the worst-performing Nasdaq-100 stock in 2025.
*   **Balance Sheet:** Some articles suggest the balance sheet is healthy despite the volatility.
*   **Analyst Price Target Cut:** Citi lowered its price target, a negative signal.

**Analysis:**

The news paints a mixed picture. The ongoing Bitcoin purchases are a bullish signal for those who believe in Bitcoin's future. The poor performance in 2025 and the analyst price target cut are bearish signals. The balance sheet's health provides some stability, but the stock is clearly influenced by Bitcoin's price swings.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy (1.29)
*   **Opinions:** 13
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 489.62 / 705.00 / 229.00

**Analysis:**

Despite recent volatility, analysts, on average, still have a "Strong Buy" rating on MSTR. However, the wide range in price targets (229 to 705) indicates significant disagreement about the company's future prospects.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |

Equity has grown substantially, reflecting the increasing value of the company (likely due to Bitcoin appreciation). ROE (Return on Equity) is highly volatile, swinging from negative to positive, correlating with Bitcoin's performance.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

MSTR is a high-risk, high-reward investment closely tied to the performance of Bitcoin. While its core business appears profitable, its financial performance and stock price are heavily influenced by Bitcoin's price fluctuations. Recent performance has been poor, the stock is technically oversold, and analyst opinions are mixed, although leaning towards "Buy". The enormous expected return is highly optimistic.

**Investment Recommendation:**

Given the high volatility and dependence on Bitcoin, MSTR is suitable only for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a strong belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. Due diligence and careful monitoring of Bitcoin's price movements are crucial. The current price decline *could* represent a buying opportunity for those bullish on Bitcoin, but potential investors should be prepared for significant price swings. Considering the recent downtrend in the stock price along with the news, the recommendation should be **risk off**.
