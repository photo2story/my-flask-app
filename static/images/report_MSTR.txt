*   **Alpha:** Recent Alpha values are extremely high, reflecting strong outperformance relative to the market.  The earlier negative Alphas suggest underperformance in those periods.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values have fluctuated. A positive Beta (particularly recently) suggests MSTR's price is now moving in the same direction as the market, and is more volatile than the market (Beta > 1). Negative Beta values in prior years indicate the opposite trend and less volatility during that period.

*   **20-day Moving Average:** $332.50
*   **60-day Moving Average:** $361.09

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 20-day moving average but below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages.
