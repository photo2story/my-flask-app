## MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) Stock Report

This report analyzes MicroStrategy Inc., a business intelligence company, based on the provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

MicroStrategy's cumulative return (1259.98%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (108.62%).  The difference is 1151.4%, placing it at the 56.5th percentile of its historical range (max: 2096.5%, min: -75%). This indicates strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but also highlights significant volatility.  The provided Alpha and Beta values across different periods show inconsistent performance relative to the market, with high Beta values (indicating higher volatility than the market) in some periods and surprisingly high Alpha (outperformance) in the most recent periods. This necessitates further investigation into the drivers behind this performance.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2015-2017  | -23.0% | 27.7% | -51.0% | 0.0 | 3.4 |
| 2016-2018  | -17.0% | 27.7% | -36.0% | 0.4 | 3.3 |
| 2017-2019  | -21.0% | 27.7% | -0.2 | 3.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 172.0% | 11.0% | 145.0% | -0.2 | 10.1 |
| 2019-2021  | 237.0% | 28.2% | -0.2 | 14.2 |

| 2021-2023  | -64.0% | 37.4% | 3.0 | 16.4 |
| 2022-2024  | 1191.0% | 37.5% | 3.1 | 75.4 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $287.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $285.18
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $298.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $334.58

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The significant daily price drop (-5.57%) from the previous close warrants further investigation into potential news or market events that may have triggered this decline.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 39.13 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.69 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, though weak)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +6.9 (Short-term upward trend in relative strength)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 89.7% (Significant expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500)

The relatively low RSI and the recent price drop indicate potential bearish sentiment, while a positive PPO and increasing relative divergence suggest some underlying bullish momentum. The significant expected return is largely dependent on the continued outperformance demonstrated in the historical data, which as noted above is not always consistent.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue      |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$1.72   | $0.12 B      |
| 2024-08-06 | -$5.74   | $0.11 B      |
| 2024-05-01 | -$3.09   | $0.12 B      |
| 2023-11-01 | -$10.09  | $0.13 B      |
| 2024-10-31 | -$1.01   | $0.13 B      |

The company has reported consistent net losses across the recent quarters. Revenue remains relatively stable, but the substantial negative EPS figures are concerning.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.12B | 71.69% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.12B | 70.41% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.11B | 72.24% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.12B | 73.96% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.12B | 77.33% |

High profit margins are reported despite negative EPS. This may reflect accounting practices or non-cash expenses.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $18.23B | -3.68% |
| 2024-09-30 | $3.77B | -9.01% |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.83B | -3.62% |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.40B | -2.21% |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.16B | 4.12% |

Equity shows significant volatility.  Negative ROE across most recent quarters is a significant concern.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

MicroStrategy's historical performance shows significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, reflected in the high cumulative return. However, this is accompanied by substantial volatility and inconsistent Alpha and Beta values across different time periods. Recent price action indicates a downward trend, supported by negative EPS and negative ROE.  The high profit margin and relatively stable revenue warrant further investigation into the company's financial reporting. The high projected long-term return is largely based on past performance and should be considered with caution due to the volatility and inconsistencies observed.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough fundamental analysis, considering the company's business model, future prospects, and current market conditions, is crucial.  The substantial recent price drop needs careful analysis to understand the underlying causes.
