| Year       | CAGR    | MDD  | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2023-2025  | 1252.0% | 71.0% | 1221.0% | 0.9 | 102.2  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows periods of significant losses followed by explosive growth in recent years.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown consistently indicates high volatility with substantial potential losses.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values, particularly in recent years, are extraordinarily high, indicating that MSTR's returns are far exceeding what would be expected based on market movements.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values fluctuate.  The negative Betas from 2015-2022 imply an inverse relationship with the market during those periods (though the values are small). In later years, the Beta turns positive, reaching highs of 3.1 in 2022-2024, indicating the stock moved more than the market and positively, meaning when the market goes up, the stock goes up much faster.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has increased dramatically, particularly in the most recent periods.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 372.20
*   **Previous Close:** 369.51
*   **Change:** 0.73
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 392.16
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 397.34
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 333.47

**Analysis:**

The stock price is currently below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent downward trend. However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating that the longer-term trend might still be positive. The small positive change compared to the previous close doesn't necessarily point to a dramatic reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.366 (Low Risk Range)
*   **RSI:** 45.62
*   **PPO:** -1.96
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_69%_Sell 0.7% of holdings (10 shares - Caution - MRI:0.35) (Cash Ratio: 69% on 2025-05-20)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -2.1 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 127.9% (Over 2+ year investment horizon, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests low risk, which seems contradictory considering the stock's volatility.  However, the MRI focuses on broader market factors.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is at 45.62, which is neutral, neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** The PPO is negative (-1.96), indicating that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, supporting the recent downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal to sell a small portion (0.7%) while holding a significant cash position (69%) indicates a cautious approach.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence suggests a short-term decline in MSTR's outperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return of 127.9% relative to the S&P 500 suggests significant potential upside for long-term investors, but also implies a high degree of risk and volatility.
*   The `price` of 372.2, the `previousClose` of 369.51, and the small `change` of 0.73 do not indicate any significant, immediate, or drastic market reactions.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜         | EPS    | 매출       |
|--------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-05-05 | -16.49 | 0.11 B$    |
| 2024-10-31 | -1.72  | 0.12 B$    |
| 2024-08-06 | -5.74  | 0.11 B$    |

| 2025-05-05 | -0.31  | 0.12 B$    |

**Analysis:**

The company has consistently reported negative Earnings Per Share (EPS) across the recent quarters. The revenue has been relatively stable, hovering around $0.11-$0.12 billion. The negative EPS, coupled with fluctuating revenue, could be a cause for concern.  The EPS is slowly improving but not profitable yet.

**6. Financial Information**

|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $0.11B | 69.41% |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.12B | 71.69% |

| 2024-03-31 | $2.40B  | -2.21%  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**  While revenue is steady, the profit margins are exceptionally high. This could be due to the nature of their software and cloud-based services, which can have low marginal costs.
*   **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has increased dramatically, especially in the most recent quarter.  However, Return on Equity (ROE) is negative, reflecting the net losses despite the high equity base.

**7. Overall Analysis and Summary**

MSTR presents a mixed picture.

*   **Strengths:** Exceptional historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), driven by massive revenue and profit margin growth. A potentially very high expected return.
*   **Weaknesses:** High volatility (high MDD and recent price action), negative EPS, negative ROE, and sensitivity to market news.
*   **Risks:** MSTR's stock price is subject to market scrutiny and significant volatility, as influenced by recent news, earnings reports, or executive actions.

**Conclusion:**

MSTR is a high-risk, high-reward investment. The extremely high expected return should be viewed with caution, as it comes with significant potential downside. The recent news events and volatility suggest that the stock could experience significant price swings. Investors should closely monitor news and company announcements before making any investment decisions. A smaller position size and risk management strategies are recommended. The data indicates recent high volatility and short-term downward momentum.
