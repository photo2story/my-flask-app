2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of MSTR based on the provided data.

**1. Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** MSTR (Microstrategy Inc)
*   **Company Overview:** Microstrategy is a company that develops and provides enterprise analytics software and services and is heavily invested in Bitcoin.
*   **MSTR Cumulative Return:** 430.64%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 99.09%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Absolute: 361.9
    *   Relative: 33.2 (Indicates that the current divergence is in the lower third of its historical range).

**Analysis:**

MSTR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. A cumulative return of 430.64% dwarfs the S&P 500's 99.09% return. However, the relative divergence of 33.2 suggests that while the outperformance is substantial, it's not as extreme compared to its historical peaks. This hints that the divergence *could* potentially widen further, but isn't necessarily guaranteed.

| 2023-2025  | 422.0%  | 83.2% | 358.0%  | 2.2   | 45.5   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows volatile performance. Recent years (2022-2025) have shown explosive growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally positive, especially in recent periods, showing MSTR's outperformance compared to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500), however, in the earlier years, Alpha was negative.
*   **Beta:** Beta is fluctuating and has recently increased significantly, implying increasing correlation with the market, in addition to increased volatility compared to the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Shows the change in market capitalization, which has increased drastically in recent years due to large investment inflows.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 158.24
*   **Previous Close:** 160.38
*   **Change:** -1.33
*   **5-day SMA:** 164.93
*   **20-day SMA:** 176.739
*   **60-day SMA:** 245.2718

**Analysis:**

The current price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This suggests a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is closest to the current price, followed by the 20-day, and then the 60-day, reinforcing this downward momentum.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 36.88 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.1421
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -5.6 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 424.8% (Long-term excess return vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI value of 36.88 indicates that the stock may be approaching an oversold condition, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, however it can remain in oversold conditions for an extended period.
*   The PPO indicates the degree of price momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a strong buy based on a composite of indicators.
*   The negative change in recent divergence confirms the recent downward price movement.
*   The MRI suggests a medium investment, but the Hybrid Signal indicates a more bullish outlook.
*   The extremely high expected return of 424.8% should be taken with a grain of salt. It suggests significant upside potential based on the model's calculations, but is subject to considerable risk.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

The news headlines paint a mixed picture:

*   **Bitcoin Falters:** "Bitcoin Falters As Strategy's Buying Power Runs Low On Fuel" This is a significant concern as MSTR's value is heavily tied to Bitcoin.
*   **Large Bitcoin Purchase:** "Michael Saylor Just Bought $1 Billion More Bitcoin. So Why Is MSTR Stock Still Down 39%?"  Indicates that even large Bitcoin purchases aren't necessarily translating to immediate gains for MSTR.
*   **Index Risks:** "Strategy Inc (MSTR) Stock News Today: Bitcoin Buys, MSCI Index Risk, Nasdaq 100 Update, and Wall Street Forecasts" This suggests potential volatility due to index-related factors.
*   **Buying the Dip?** "Strategy Keeps Buying Bitcoin. It Isn’t Helping the Stock." Further reinforces the disconnect between Bitcoin accumulation and MSTR's stock performance.
*   **Negative Forecasts:** "Peter Schiff Expects 50% MSTR Stock Crash and Bitcoin Below $50K" and "MSTR stock price may crash to $100 as dilution rises, mNAV nears negative" These are strong bearish signals.

**Analysis:** The news is overwhelmingly negative, with concerns about Bitcoin's performance, MSTR's correlation, potential stock dilution, and outright predictions of a stock crash.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy (1.29) based on 13 opinions.
*   **Target Price:** Average $501.92, High $705.00, Low $229.00

**Analysis:**

Despite the negative news flow, the analyst consensus remains very bullish, with a strong buy rating and a substantial average target price. This creates a significant divergence between analyst sentiment and recent market events.  It's important to note the wide range between the high and low target prices, indicating considerable uncertainty among analysts.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출        |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2025-11-03 | 9.3     | 0.13 B$     |
| 2025-08-05 | 36.23   | 0.11 B$     |
| 2025-05-05 | -16.49  | 0.11 B$     |
| 2024-10-31 | -1.72   | 0.12 B$     |
| 2025-11-03 | -1.72   | 0.12 B$     |

**Analysis:**

*   EPS has been highly volatile. There was a significant loss, followed by a strong gain, and more recently positive EPS.
*   Revenue has remained relatively stable. This suggests that profit fluctuations are likely due to factors other than sales volume, such as Bitcoin valuations or other investments.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE     |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| 2025-09-30 | $58.12B  | 4.79%   |

| 2024-09-30 | $3.77B   | -9.01%  |

**Analysis:**

*   Revenue is relatively stable across the quarters.
*   Profit margins are consistently high, suggesting good operational efficiency.
*   Equity has increased significantly, particularly in the recent quarters. This likely reflects the increasing value of Bitcoin holdings.
*   ROE is volatile, mirroring the fluctuations in earnings and reflecting the company's sensitivity to Bitcoin price swings. The large swing from negative to positive, and then a reduction indicates significant volatility in the profitability of equity.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

MSTR presents a highly complex and risky investment profile.

*   **High Growth, High Risk:** MSTR has delivered exceptional returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this outperformance is accompanied by extreme volatility, as evidenced by the high Maximum Drawdowns and fluctuating Beta.
*   **Bitcoin Dependence:** The company's performance is inextricably linked to Bitcoin. This creates both an opportunity (if Bitcoin continues to rise) and a significant risk (if Bitcoin declines).
*   **Conflicting Signals:** The analyst consensus is strongly bullish, while recent news headlines are overwhelmingly negative. This suggests a potential disconnect between long-term fundamental expectations and short-term market sentiment.
*   **Recent Downtrend:** Technical indicators (SMAs, RSI, recent divergence change) suggest a short-term downtrend.
*   **Valuation Concerns:** News articles raise concerns about stock dilution and negative mNAV, which could put pressure on the stock price.
*   **High Expected Return:** The model's projected expected return is exceptionally high, but should be viewed cautiously due to the inherent risks involved.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in MSTR is essentially a leveraged bet on Bitcoin. It's suitable for investors with a high risk tolerance and a strong conviction in the long-term prospects of Bitcoin. Given the recent negative news flow and the current downtrend, caution is warranted. The divergence between analyst sentiment and market events suggests potential for significant price swings in either direction. Investors should carefully weigh the potential rewards against the considerable risks before making any investment decisions.
