*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The "Sell 80%" signal, driven by a risky MRI score of 0.5, indicates significant concern about short-term performance and recommends reducing exposure.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence indicates a recent underperformance compared to the market.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 312.0% is exceptionally high and suggests the model anticipates substantial future growth. However, given the volatility and risk profile of MSTR, this projection should be viewed with caution.

However, the Hybrid Signal recommends reducing exposure due to increased risk. Analyst opinions are generally positive, but target prices vary widely.

Given the volatility, understanding Bitcoin and the overall cryptocurrency market is crucial.
