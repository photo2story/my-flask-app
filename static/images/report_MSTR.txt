*   **Conflicting Signals:** Technical indicators present conflicting signals.  The MRI suggests low overall risk, while the RSI indicates it might be approaching oversold territory.
*   **Strong Profitability, Volatile Earnings:** The company maintains high profit margins, but EPS and ROE have been very volatile.
