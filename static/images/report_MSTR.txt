**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** MSTR
*   **Company Overview:** Microstrategy Inc. is a company known for its enterprise analytics software and, more recently, its significant investment in Bitcoin.
*   **MSTR Cumulative Return:** 432.55%

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | -25.0% | 70.2%  | -53.0% | -0.1  | 3.7    |
| 2016-2018  | -19.0% | 70.2%  | -34.0% | -0.1  | 3.6    |
| 2017-2019  | -25.0% | 68.7%  | -47.0% | -0.1  | 4.0    |
| 2018-2020  | 78.0%  | 80.4%  | 55.0%  | -0.2  | 10.9   |
| 2019-2021  | 122.0% | 80.4%  | 75.0%  | -0.6  | 15.3   |
| 2020-2022  | -16.0% | 80.4%  | -15.0% | -0.2  | 4.0    |
| 2021-2023  | -1.0%  | 80.0%  | -3.0%  | 1.4   | 17.8   |
| 2022-2024  | 716.0% | 81.1%  | 695.0% | 1.5   | 81.4   |
| 2023-2025  | 424.0% | 83.2%  | 356.0% | 2.2   | 44.6   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows volatile performance.  Recent years (2022-2025, 2023-2025) exhibit very high growth, likely due to its Bitcoin strategy. Earlier periods (2015-2019, 2020-2022, 2021-2023) show negative growth or minimal growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD across all periods indicates substantial risk and volatility. An MDD over 80% signifies very large potential losses.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the excess return compared to a benchmark (likely the market). The high positive alpha in recent years confirms significant outperformance. Earlier periods have negative Alpha figures
*   **Beta:** Measures volatility relative to the market. A beta consistently around or below 0 until 2020-2022 suggests MSTR wasn't strongly correlated with market movement during those times. Beta increase to 1.4 and 2.2 on 2021-2023 and 2022-2025, 2023-2025 period, indicates increased volatility relative to the market in more recent times. This is likely due to its Bitcoin holdings which are extremely volatile
*   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization has fluctuated considerably, growing significantly in recent years, reflecting the impact of Bitcoin's price appreciation on MSTR's value.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 158.81
*   **Last Market:** Price: 155.39, Previous Close: 158.81, Change: -2.15
*   **5-day SMA:** 160.91
*   **20-day SMA:** 173.24
*   **60-day SMA:** 232.19

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a short-term downward trend. The 5-day SMA is closest to the current price, suggesting recent stabilization or a potential for a short-term rebound. The larger the difference between the SMA and the price, the more the downward trend has been in force. The change of -2.15 indicates a recent drop in price.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 34.72 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.43
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 445.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** While the MRI suggests high investment suitability, it's crucial to interpret this cautiously in light of MSTR's inherent volatility.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 34.72 suggests the stock is nearing oversold conditions, which could indicate a potential buying opportunity. However, oversold conditions can persist for extended periods, especially in a downtrend.
*   **PPO:** The PPO measures the momentum of a stock. A PPO of 0.43 indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, suggesting that a bullish trend is in place. The recent decline and the proximity to zero indicate that the momentum is decreasing.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal reinforces the bullish outlook.
*   **Divergence Change:** The negative divergence change over the last 20 days confirms the recent price weakness.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (445.1%) should be taken with extreme caution. It is a projection based on a model and likely heavily influenced by MSTR's historical Bitcoin-related performance. High expected returns are generally associated with high risk.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Focus on Bitcoin:**  Multiple articles highlight MSTR's connection to Bitcoin and how Bitcoin's price movements influence the stock.
*   **Analyst Target Range:** The wide range in analyst target prices (229.00 to 705.00) indicates considerable uncertainty about MSTR's future valuation.
*   **Collapse Risk:** One article explicitly mentions the possibility of MicroStrategy being the next black swan.
*   **Balance Sheet Strength:**  Another article argues the balance sheet is sound.
*   **ATM Stock Proceeds:** The company continues to purchase more Bitcoin, even using funds from stock sales.

**Analysis:**

The news flow is mixed.  The company's strong link to Bitcoin is both a potential strength (if Bitcoin rises) and a significant risk (if Bitcoin falls). The analyst target range indicates high uncertainty. The "black swan" article is a major red flag, suggesting potential systemic risks associated with MSTR's Bitcoin strategy. The fact that MSTR continues to acquire bitcoin by issuing stock could be a sign of overzealousness or lack of other profitable ventures.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy (1.29)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 489.62, High: 705.00, Low: 229.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is overwhelmingly positive. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices reveals uncertainty. Keep in mind that analyst ratings can be lagging indicators and may not fully reflect the risks associated with MSTR's Bitcoin strategy. The lack of recent rating changes mean they are unlikely to be very reactive.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜        | EPS    | 매출      |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| 2025-11-03 | 9.3    | 0.13 B$   |
| 2025-08-05 | 36.23  | 0.11 B$   |
| 2025-05-05 | -16.49 | 0.11 B$   |
| 2024-10-31 | -1.72  | 0.12 B$   |
| 2025-11-03 | -1.72  | 0.12 B$   |

**Analysis:** Earnings per share (EPS) has been very volatile. Most recent two quarters are very positive, with previous quarters alternating between losses and gains.  Revenue (매출) is relatively stable but shows little growth. The last identical date is a copy-paste error and should be investigated on the source.
