**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows periods of significant negative growth, followed by explosive growth in recent years (2018-2025).  The last two periods (2022-2025) are particularly notable.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the performance of the investment compared to the market index. MSTR showed periods of negative alpha, indicating underperformance relative to the market (VOO) during the initial years. However, it has dramatically improved, showing extremely high alpha in recent periods (2018-2025), suggesting the stock has generated returns far exceeding what would be expected based on market movements alone.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility compared to the market. The beta values vary over time. The negative beta values ​​suggested that the stock moved in the opposite direction to the market in some periods. But recent values suggest a positive correlation with the market, especially the large betas in the last periods (2021-2025) indicate that the stock is much more volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has increased dramatically.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movements

*   **Last Market Data:** Price = 399.13, Previous Close = 403.99, Change = -1.2
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 394.83
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 383.30
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 371.79

**Analysis:**

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The recent drop of -1.2 indicates a slight pullback, but the overall trend remains positive. The negative change from the previous close warrants attention as a potential reversal signal.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3301 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 58.78 (Approaching overbought territory, but not yet there)

**Analysis:**

The MRI suggests low market risk overall. RSI is approaching overbought levels. The PPO indicates a bullish trend. The hybrid signal suggests a cautious buy recommendation, while maintaining a 0% cash position.  The positive change in relative divergence supports a short-term upward trend. The very high expected return (137.7%) suggests significant potential for long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this should be viewed with caution given the stock's volatility. The price drop of -1.2 may suggest caution.

### 6. Financial Information

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------- |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.11B  | 69.41%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.12B  | 71.69%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.12B  | 70.41%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.11B  | 72.24%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.12B  | 73.96%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE        |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
| 2025-03-31 | $33.53B  | -12.58%    |
| 2024-12-31 | $18.23B  | -3.68%     |
| 2024-09-30 | $3.77B   | -9.01%     |

| 2024-03-31 | $2.40B   | -2.21%     |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable. Profit margins are consistently high, suggesting strong pricing power or efficient cost management despite the negative EPS.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has increased significantly, likely due to factors like stock issuance or unrealized gains on assets (e.g., Bitcoin holdings, if applicable). Return on Equity (ROE) is negative, consistent with the negative EPS, and this is a potential concern.

### 7. 종합 Analysis

**Summary:**

Microstrategy (MSTR) exhibits a complex and potentially high-risk/high-reward profile:

*   **Performance:**  Extraordinary historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by recent explosive growth.
*   **Volatility:** High volatility, as evidenced by the MDD and Beta figures.
*   **Financials:**  Negative EPS and ROE are significant red flags. High and stable profit margins and rising equity are positive factors.
*   **Market Sentiment:**  Mixed signals. Low MRI suggests low market risk, but RSI nearing overbought, caution is warranted.
*   **News:** The presence of market events, regulatory changes, discussions of performance, and volatility suggests active market interest and the need to monitor the stock.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent positive change indicates short-term upward momentum, but this is balanced by the last market change

**Overall Recommendation:**

MSTR is a speculative investment. The potential for significant returns (high expected return and recent alpha) is undeniable, but it comes with substantial risk. Investors should be aware of the company's high volatility, negative earnings, and reliance on market factors. A cautious buy position is suggested, but with close monitoring of news and market developments. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence before investing.
