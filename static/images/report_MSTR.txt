2025-01-21 - Analysis Report
## Microstrategy Inc. (MSTR) Stock Report

This report analyzes Microstrategy Inc. (MSTR), a publicly traded company that provides enterprise analytics and mobility software, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Microstrategy's cumulative return (1806.22%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (118.37%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 1687.8%, placing it at the 81.2th percentile of the historical maximum and minimum divergence between MSTR and VOO.  This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the broader market.  However, this extreme outperformance should be viewed with caution; it may not be sustainable.  The provided Alpha values of 0.0 consistently across various periods also indicate that any outperformance wasn't statistically significant from a market-adjusted perspective.  The high Beta (consistently around 98) suggests high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $396.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $358.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $340.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $337.06

The price is significantly above all moving averages, suggesting a recent strong upward trend. The large difference between the closing price and the moving averages indicates a rapid price increase.  The last day's price change of approximately 8% further supports this observation.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 60.64  - Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, indicating a neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.58 - A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +14.9% - This positive change reinforces the short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 33.9% - This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.  This should be considered cautiously, as such high long-term projections usually come with increased risk.  The recent price surge needs to be factored into any forecast.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility and recent losses.  Specifically,

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     | Notes                                  |
|------------|--------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$1.72 | $0.12 B     |                                         |
| 2024-08-06 | -$5.74 | $0.11 B     | Significantly lower than previous quarters |
| 2024-05-01 | -$3.09 | $0.12 B     |                                         |
| 2023-11-01 | -$10.09| $0.13 B     | Significantly lower than previous quarters |
| 2024-10-31 | -$1.01 | $0.13 B     | (Duplicate date, potential error in data)  |


The data shows inconsistent and largely negative earnings per share (EPS) over the reported periods. Revenue remains relatively stable, though not particularly strong.  The duplicate entry for 2024-10-31 needs clarification.  Further analysis is required to understand the underlying reasons for these fluctuations.

| 2023-09-30 | $0.84B | -17.07%  |                                          |


Negative Return on Equity (ROE) in most recent quarters indicates a concerning trend.  Understanding the reasons behind this negative ROE is crucial for evaluating the company's financial health.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Microstrategy's performance significantly outpaces the S&P 500, but this is driven by volatility and potentially unsustainable factors.  The company shows high profit margins but negative ROE and inconsistent, largely negative EPS.  The recent price surge raises concerns about potential overvaluation.  Further investigation into the causes of negative ROE, volatile earnings, and the reasons behind recent price jumps is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high Beta also implies considerable risk.  A thorough due diligence process, including analysis of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is essential before investing in MSTR.
