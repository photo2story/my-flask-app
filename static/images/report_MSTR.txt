**Microstrategy Inc. Overview:** Microstrategy is a company that provides enterprise analytics software and services, and has significantly invested in Bitcoin.

## 1) Return Rate Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **MSTR Cumulative Return:** 525.86%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 100.36%
*   **Divergence:** 426.1
*   **Relative Divergence:** 38.2

**Analysis:** MSTR has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period examined. The divergence of 426.1 represents a significant difference in cumulative returns.  However, the *relative divergence* of 38.2 indicates that the *current* divergence is relatively low compared to its historical range (meaning the gap between MSTR's performance and VOO's is closer to the *lower* end of what it has been in the past).  This suggests that while MSTR is performing exceptionally well, its recent performance relative to VOO may be cooling off.
