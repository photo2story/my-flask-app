## Microstrategy Inc. (MSTR) Stock Report

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Microstrategy Inc. is a business intelligence company that provides software and services for enterprise analytics.  The company's stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, but shows recent volatility.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **MSTR Cumulative Return:** 1203.02%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 108.99%
* **Return Difference:** 1094.03% (This shows the difference in cumulative returns.  The relative divergence of 53.8% indicates MSTR's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to VOO, considering the min and max divergence values.)

The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals significant volatility and varying performance relative to the market.  High beta values (e.g., 3.3-16.4) indicate higher-than-average market sensitivity.  However, the exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in 2022-2025 (1191.0% and 1163.0%) suggests significant gains during this period.  Negative CAGR values in other years highlight substantial periods of underperformance.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $275.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $256.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $303.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $339.37

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price change of +9.66% indicates a significant jump, potentially a short-term rebound.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 38.92 (Approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.)
* **PPO:** -1.77 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.3% (Short-term upward trend.)

The significant price change ('change': 9.66%) reflects a notable upward bounce.  The combination of indicators is mixed, suggesting potential for short-term recovery but with underlying bearish momentum. The expected return of 95.9% over the long term (2+ years) significantly exceeds the expected return of the S&P 500,  but this projection should be treated with caution considering past volatility.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$1.72  | $0.12 B     |
| 2024-08-06 | -$5.74  | $0.11 B     |

| 2023-11-01 | -$10.09 | $0.13 B     |
| 2024-10-31 | -$1.01  | $0.13 B     |

Consistent negative EPS indicates ongoing losses. While revenue is relatively stable, the company is not currently profitable.  Further investigation into the nature of the business and its future outlook is needed.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.12B | 71.69%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.12B | 70.41%      |

| 2023-12-31 | $0.12B | 77.33%      |

High profit margins suggest efficient operations, but this is offset by consistent negative EPS.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE       |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $18.23B   | -3.68%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $3.77B    | -9.01%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.83B    | -3.62%    |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.40B    | -2.21%    |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.16B    | 4.12%     |

Negative ROE across multiple quarters indicates the company is not generating returns on its equity investment.  Significant fluctuation in equity values raises concerns.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

MSTR has shown periods of exceptional growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 in certain years.  However, the company consistently reports negative EPS and ROE, raising significant concerns about its long-term financial sustainability.  While recent price action shows a potential short-term bounce, the underlying fundamentals appear weak.  The high volatility makes it a risky investment.  Further due diligence, including a deep dive into the company's strategic direction and future plans, is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high projected long-term return should be treated with significant skepticism given the financial indicators.
