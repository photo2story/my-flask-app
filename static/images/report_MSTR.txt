## Microstrategy Inc. (MSTR) Investment Review

This report analyzes Microstrategy Inc. (MSTR), a publicly traded business intelligence company known for its significant Bitcoin holdings, using the provided data.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Microstrategy's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's.  The difference is 1512.0 (1628.43 - 116.43), representing a substantial outperformance. The relative outperformance (73.1%) indicates that MSTR's performance is in the upper 73rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. This should be considered in context, as this historical performance doesn't guarantee future returns. The high beta (around 91) suggests high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The alpha of 0.0 across all periods suggests that the outperformance is primarily due to market timing rather than stock selection.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $359.52
* **Last Market Price:** $369.29  (This implies a recent increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $343.72
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $339.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $333.98

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. The difference between the last market price ($369.29) and the closing price ($359.52) indicates a recent price jump which would need further investigation for context.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (50.28):**  Indicates a neutral market sentiment, neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (0.64):** A positive PPO suggests a bullish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence (+6.1):** Shows a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (42.3%):**  This represents a significant potential for outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with consistent investment.  This projection is highly dependent on the success of MSTR's investment strategy and broader market conditions.

The significant jump in the last market price to $369.29 compared to the closing price could be attributed to news events affecting the stock's price. This jump warrants further investigation and consideration before making any investment decision.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant variability and negative EPS in several quarters.  The company consistently missed earnings expectations, except in Q1 2024. This volatility underscores the risk associated with investing in MSTR.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the unpredictable earnings.

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | -1.56    | -0.123       | -1.437       |
| 2024-08-01 | -0.76    | -0.09267     | -0.66733     |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, hovering around $0.12B per quarter. Profit margins are high, consistently above 70%. However, Equity and ROE figures show significant volatility and negative returns in several quarters. The negative ROE in several quarters, despite high profit margins, warrants further investigation into the companyâ€™s capital structure and investment strategies.

| Quarter     | Revenue (B) | Profit Margin | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.12       | 70.41%        | $3.77       | -9.01   |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.11       | 72.24%        | $2.83       | -3.62   |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.12       | 73.96%        | $2.40       | -2.21   |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.12       | 77.33%        | $2.16       | 4.12    |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Microstrategy shows a high potential for returns, driven primarily by its Bitcoin holdings and successful market timing.  However, it comes with substantial risk. The high volatility, negative ROE in some periods, erratic earnings, and high beta highlight the significant uncertainty associated with this investment.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in MSTR.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended, including a deep dive into the company's Bitcoin holdings valuation, its business model beyond Bitcoin, and future growth prospects. The recent price jump should be investigated for any news that might explain it.  The long-term outlook is influenced greatly by the price of Bitcoin.
