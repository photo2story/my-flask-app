## Microstrategy Inc. (MSTR) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Microstrategy Inc. (MSTR) is a business intelligence company that provides software and services for enterprise analytics.  The provided data shows MSTR's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns is 1914.09 (MSTR: 2039.69 - VOO: 125.6).  This places MSTR at the 100th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, according to the provided relative divergence metric.  However, this high relative performance needs to be considered in the context of the substantial volatility evidenced by the provided alpha and beta analysis (see point 1 below).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The table reveals high volatility and significant swings in performance.  While recent years (2022-2024) show exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and alpha, preceding periods demonstrate considerable losses and negative CAGRs.  The high beta values (often above 1.2) consistently indicate that MSTR's price movements are considerably more volatile than the overall market (represented by the S&P 500).  This high volatility is reflected in the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures, which show substantial losses during periods of market downturn.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | -19.5%   | 32.9%   | -57.9% | 1.2   | 2.7    |
| 2016-2018  | -25.4%   | 32.9%   | -57.6% | 1.0   | 2.6    |
| 2017-2019  | -27.9%   | 32.9%   | -79.6% | 0.8   | 2.9    |
| 2018-2020  | 194.8%  | 38.7%   | 147.4% | 0.8   | 8.0    |
| 2019-2021  | 323.5%  | 64.3%   | 223.5% | 0.9   | 11.2   |
| 2020-2022  | -1.9%    | 88.1%   | -25.5% | 1.6   | 2.9    |
| 2021-2023  | 48.5%   | 88.1%   | 13.6%  | 2.8   | 12.9   |
| 2022-2024  | 671.2%  | 73.7%   | 642.3% | 2.9   | 78.9   |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 430.54
* **Last Market Price:** 430.98
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 362.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 283.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 201.25

The price is significantly above all moving averages, suggesting a recent strong upward trend.  This supports the high cumulative returns shown but again highlights considerable volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 81.54  -  This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction is due.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 3.27 - A positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** 0.0 (-) - Suggests a recent short-term decline.

The combination of a high RSI and recent negative short-term divergence suggests caution.  The price being above the last market price (430.98) by a negligible margin doesn't indicate any significant price jump (i.e. 급반등).  The expected return of 0.26% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is very low and needs to be carefully considered against the high risk profile.

**4. Recent Financials and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows consistent negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) and relatively stable but low revenue. The most recent earnings for the quarter ending 2024-10-31 reported an EPS of -1.72, which is a significant improvement compared to previous quarters, but still negative.  Without analyst estimates for comparison, it's difficult to assess whether this is a positive or negative deviation from expectations. Further analysis is needed to determine if this recent improvement is sustainable or a temporary anomaly.


| Date        | EPS     | Revenue     |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31  | -1.72   | $0.12 B     |
| 2024-08-06  | -5.74   | $0.11 B     |
| 2024-05-01  | -3.09   | $0.12 B     |
| 2023-11-01  | -10.09  | $0.13 B     |
| 2024-10-31  | -1.01   | $0.13 B     |  *(Note: Duplicate date)*


**5. Revenue and Profitability:**

Profit margins are high but revenue remains low.  The negative ROE (Return on Equity) in most recent quarters is a cause for concern and needs more detailed analysis.

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $0.12B     | 70.41%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.11B     | 72.24%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.12B     | 73.96%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.12B     | 77.33%        |
| 2023-09-30  | $0.13B     | 79.41%        |


| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE           |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $3.77B     | -9.01%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $2.83B     | -3.62%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $2.40B     | -2.21%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $2.16B     | 4.12%         |
| 2023-09-30  | $0.84B     | -17.07%       |

**7. Summary:**

MSTR has shown exceptionally high returns relative to the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by extremely high volatility and periods of significant losses.  The recent price surge has pushed the stock into overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction.  While recent earnings show some improvement, they remain negative.  The high beta and negative ROE raise significant concerns.  Further investigation is needed to validate the sustainability of the recent positive trends and assess the long-term risk-reward profile.  Analyzing recent news and analyst opinions will provide a more comprehensive picture.  The currently provided 0.26% expected return relative to the S&P 500 is very low, reflecting these uncertainties.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the high risk and volatility associated with MSTR, a long-term investment requires a very high risk tolerance.  Thorough due diligence is crucial, including a deep dive into recent news, analyst reports, and the sustainability of the company's recent financial performance.  The extremely high current valuation relative to the market (reflected in the relative divergence metric) would warrant additional caution.  Given the information provided, a more conservative approach to investment or seeking professional financial advice before investing in MSTR is strongly recommended.
