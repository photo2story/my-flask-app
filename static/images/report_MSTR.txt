## Microstrategy Inc. (MSTR) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Microstrategy Inc. (MSTR) is a business intelligence company that provides software and services for enterprise analytics.

The provided data shows MSTR's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative return between MSTR and VOO is 1535.034936322044 - 121.08739800074844 = **1413.95**.  The relative divergence of 68.6% indicates that MSTR's performance has been considerably higher than the S&P 500 in the period analyzed, placing it in the higher percentile of its historical performance range relative to the benchmark.  However, it's crucial to note that this high relative divergence is influenced by extreme volatility shown in the CAGR and MDD figures below.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha values are consistently 0.0 across all periods, suggesting that MSTR's performance is not consistently exceeding the market's return based on this limited analysis. This is particularly important given the wide divergence. The high Beta values (often exceeding 3.0 and reaching as high as 73.1) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The periods of extremely high CAGR are counterbalanced by periods of significant negative CAGR, highlighting the considerable risk associated with investing in MSTR.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|-------|

| 2017-2019  | -21.0%   | 27.7%    | 0.0   | 3.6   |       |
| 2018-2020  | 172.0%   | 11.0%    | 0.0   | 9.8   |       |

| 2022-2024  | 1191.0%  | 37.5%    | 0.0   | 73.1  |       |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $340.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $343.77
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $348.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $352.88

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend.  The recent price change (-$0.34) indicates a minor decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.01 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.64 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -7.2% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 51.3% (Long-term expected excess return over S&P 500)

The technical indicators present a mixed signal.  While the RSI is neutral, the PPO and the negative relative divergence suggest bearish momentum in the short-term. The large expected return, however,  indicates significant potential for long-term growth, exceeding that of the S&P 500.  The relatively small recent price drop does not signal a significant event.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

MSTR has reported significant losses (negative EPS) in recent quarters.  Revenue remains relatively stable but low compared to the significant losses. The high volatility noted above may be a factor. Further investigation is required to understand the cause of these losses and the company's future outlook.


| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -1.72  | $0.12 B     |
| 2024-08-06 | -5.74  | $0.11 B     |
| 2024-05-01 | -3.09  | $0.12 B     |
| 2023-11-01 | -10.09 | $0.13 B     |
| 2024-10-31 | -1.01  | $0.13 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is relatively stable, while profitability (profit margin) is high, albeit declining slightly.  Equity has shown considerable fluctuations, impacting the Return on Equity (ROE). The negative ROE values in most quarters are cause for concern.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.12B    | 70.41%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.11B    | 72.24%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.12B    | 73.96%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.12B    | 77.33%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.13B    | 79.41%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE     |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $3.77B    | -9.01%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.83B    | -3.62%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.40B    | -2.21%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.16B    | 4.12%   |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.84B    | -17.07% |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

MSTR exhibits exceptionally high volatility and a significant divergence from the S&P 500, driven by periods of extremely high returns and substantial losses. Despite a high profit margin, substantial losses and negative ROE highlight considerable financial risk. While the projected long-term return is attractive, this potential is coupled with significant short-term risk and market sensitivity. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in MSTR.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the significant losses is needed to better gauge future performance.
