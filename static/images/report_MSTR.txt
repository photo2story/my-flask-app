---

## 1️⃣ Return‑Rate Comparison  
**Simple Numbers**  
| Metric | MSTR | VOO (S&P 500) | Divergence |
|--------|------|---------------|------------|
| Cumulative Return | **419.64 %** | **94.03 %** | **+325.6 %** |

**Analysis**  
- MSTR has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than **3.5×** over the period.  
- The **relative divergence** of **29.4 %** places MSTR in the **upper‑30 %** of its historical fluctuation range, indicating a strong, but not extreme, performance edge.  
- Such a large divergence often reflects the company’s heavy exposure to Bitcoin and the recent volatility of that asset class.

## 2️⃣ Alpha & Beta Snapshot  
**CAGR & Risk**  

- **2018‑2020**: +82 % CAGR, +16.5 % MDD, **Beta 11.2** – very high sensitivity to market moves.  
- **2022‑2024**: +718 % CAGR, +53.4 % MDD, **Beta 83.8** – explosive growth but extremely volatile.  
- **2023‑2025**: +394 % CAGR, +59.7 % MDD, **Beta 44.0** – still high beta.  
- **Alpha** has been largely positive since 2018, but dropped dramatically in 2016‑2019 due to market‑wide downturns.  

**Bottom Line**  
MSTR delivers massive returns **only** when the market (and crypto market) rallies; it is **highly leveraged** to systematic risk.

## 3️⃣ Short‑Term Price Activity  
**Current Snapshot**  

- **Close**: $157.33 (down $5.77 from prev. close)  
- **5‑Day SMA**: $161.76 – price is **below** short‑term trend.  
- **20‑Day SMA**: $162.07 – price remains **below** mid‑term average.  
- **60‑Day SMA**: $206.63 – price is **significantly below** long‑term support.

**Interpretation**  
- Recent pullback has left MSTR trading under both 5‑ and 20‑day SMAs, signaling a possible short‑term reversal or consolidation.  
- Being well below the 60‑day SMA raises a short‑term bearish flag unless a breakout occurs.

- **Performance**: MSTR outpaces the S&P 500 by over **325 %** cumulative return, but is **highly volatile** (Beta 44–84).  
- **Technicals**: Price sits below short‑term and long‑term SMAs—short‑term bearish bias, but expected return remains lofty.  
- **Indicators**: RSI neutral, MRI medium risk, PPO modest; expected long‑term return **+573 %**.  
- **News & Analysts**: Recent target cuts and mixed commentary hint at a **cautious outlook**, despite MSCI index inclusion.  
- **Earnings**: Quarterly EPS swings from deep losses to large gains; revenue modest but margin spikes are crypto‑driven.
