*   **Bitcoin Dependence:**  MSTR's financial performance is heavily dependent on the price of Bitcoin.  Earnings, ROE, and stock price are all significantly influenced by Bitcoin's movements.

A conservative approach might involve a small allocation within a diversified portfolio. Investors should carefully monitor Bitcoin prices, company news, and analyst ratings to make informed decisions.
