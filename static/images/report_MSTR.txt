    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR shows periods of significant growth (2018-2021, 2022-2025) and periods of decline (2015-2019, 2020-2023). The recent periods (2022-2025, 2023-2025) show extremely high growth rates.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD consistently remains high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally negative until 2018.  The recent periods (2018+) show very high positive Alpha, suggesting MSTR has significantly outperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values vary. A beta near zero suggests the stock is relatively uncorrelated with the market; Beta above 1 indicates MSTR is more volatile than the market, while Beta below 1 indicates the opposite. The fluctuating beta suggests a changing sensitivity to overall market movements.
    *   **Cap(B):** This likely represents Market Capitalization in Billions. The capital grew massively during the recent bullish period (2022-2024).

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 188.39
*   **Last-market price:** 178.99
*   **Last-market change:** -3.77
*   **5-day SMA:** 182.49
*   **20-day SMA:** 201.86
*   **60-day SMA:** 274.28

    *   The current price (178.99) is below the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This indicates a recent downtrend, as the price has fallen below its short-term and medium-term averages. The larger difference between the 60-day SMA and the current price suggests a more significant pullback from previous highs.
    *   The last-market change (-3.77) indicates a recent negative movement.

**3) RSI, PPO, Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence, Expected_Return Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment) - Suggests moderate risk levels for investment.
*   **RSI:** 33.30 - The RSI is below 30, indicating that MSTR is potentially oversold. This could suggest a possible rebound in the near term, but it doesn't guarantee it.
*   **PPO:** 0.679 - The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) measures the momentum of a stock. A positive PPO suggests upward momentum, although the specific interpretation depends on its magnitude and historical context.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash\_1%\_Buy 90% of cash (341 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) - Recommends buying 90% of available cash, leaving 1% in cash, and rates this action as "safe" given the current MRI.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (-): Short-term decline.  This confirms the recent price weakness seen in the moving averages.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 322.4% - This is a very high expected return, suggesting significant potential upside if held long-term (more than 2 years).

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

The news headlines present a mixed picture:

*   **Positive Headlines:**
    *   "Wall Street Loves Strategy Twice As Much As Any Other Stock"
    *   "Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) Faces Headwinds, but Will Benefit as Bitcoin Rebounds"
    *   "Strategy (MSTR) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why"
*   **Negative Headlines:**
    *   "Strategy (MSTR Stock) Sentiment Is Sinking Faster Than Bitcoin on The Titanic"
    *   "Analyst cuts 60% price target for popular Bitcoin stock"
    *   "Analyst downgrades MicroStrategy amid higher dilution"

This mixed sentiment suggests uncertainty surrounding MSTR's future performance. The stock appears to be closely tied to Bitcoin's performance, and analyst opinions are divided.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Strong Buy (1.43) based on 14 opinions.
*   **Target Price:** Average target price is 491.07, with a high of 705.00 and a low of 200.00.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** The absence of specific "from" and "to" ratings changes suggests that this information is either unavailable or unchanged recently.

The "Strong Buy" consensus and significantly higher average target price compared to the current price suggest analysts generally believe the stock is undervalued. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates a lack of strong conviction and differing opinions on the stock's potential.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출       |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2025-11-03 | 9.3    | 0.13 B$    |
| 2025-08-05 | 36.23  | 0.11 B$    |
| 2025-05-05 | -16.49 | 0.11 B$    |
| 2024-10-31 | -1.72  | 0.12 B$    |
| 2025-11-03 | -1.72  | 0.12 B$    |

*   **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** EPS has fluctuated significantly. The recent EPS figures are positive and high, but there was a significant loss in 2025-05.
*   **Revenue:** Revenue has been relatively stable around $0.11-$0.13 billion.

The volatile EPS, coupled with stable revenue, indicates potential issues with cost management or non-operating factors impacting profitability. The positive EPS figures in the recent quarters are encouraging, but the history of fluctuations warrants caution.

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE     |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| 2025-09-30   | $58.12B   | 4.79%   |
| 2025-06-30   | $50.37B   | 19.89%  |

| 2024-09-30   | $3.77B    | -9.01%  |

*   **Revenue:** Consistent revenue around $0.11B-$0.13B indicates stable sales performance.
*   **Profit Margin:** High profit margins (around 70%) suggest efficient operations and pricing power.
*   **Equity:** Equity has increased significantly over the period, indicating strong growth in the company's net assets.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE has fluctuated. The increase in Equity is not always matched by profitability which explains why ROE has dropped significantly in 2025-09, despite the large equity increase.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Microstrategy (MSTR) presents a complex and high-risk/high-reward investment opportunity.

*   **Strong Performance & Volatility:** MSTR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in recent years, but it has also exhibited substantial volatility (high MDD, fluctuating Beta). This volatility is likely linked to the company's connection to Bitcoin.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators (RSI suggesting oversold conditions, positive PPO) offer mixed signals. News headlines are also mixed, with some positive articles contrasting with analyst downgrades.
*   **Financials:** While revenue is stable and profit margins are high, EPS has been volatile. Equity has increased substantially, but ROE has declined in the most recent quarter.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts have an overall "Strong Buy" consensus, but the wide range of target prices reveals a lack of uniform conviction.
*   **Forward-Looking:** The expected return is extremely high, but investors should consider this in the context of the company's high risk and dependence on Bitcoin's performance.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in MSTR appears to be a speculative play, heavily reliant on the future performance of Bitcoin and the company's ability to navigate its business strategy. Due diligence is crucial, and investors should be prepared for significant price swings. The recent downtrend, mixed news, and analyst concerns suggest caution is warranted, despite the positive analyst consensus and high expected return. The potential for high returns must be weighed against the substantial risk involved.
