*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Consistently high, indicating significant price volatility and risk.

*   **Beta:** Beta has shifted from negative to positive in recent periods, indicating that MSTR is moving from being inversely correlated to being more positively correlated with the market. This may indicate a change in how the stock is reacting to general market sentiment.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization):** Has grown substantially, reflecting the increase in stock price and investor interest.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close Price:** 164.82
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 164.82, Previous Close: 158.24, Change: 4.16
*   **5-day SMA:** 162.60
*   **20-day SMA:** 176.12
*   **60-day SMA:** 243.01

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which could be interpreted as a short-term downward trend. However, the price is above the 5-day SMA, indicating a potential short-term rebound.
*   The positive change from the previous close suggests some recent upward momentum.

**3. RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.07
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.29
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-11)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -5.6 (단기하락 - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 424.8%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.7 indicates a "Medium Investment" recommendation, suggesting a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 36.07 is below 50, suggesting slightly bearish momentum. An RSI of 30 or below is typically considered oversold.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, potentially indicating an upward trend, though not strong.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests a "Buy" recommendation with 0% cash, based on its algorithm.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence (-5.6) supports the interpretation of a recent short-term decline, as the divergence to the S&P 500 has narrowed slightly in the last 20 days.
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return (424.8%) should be treated with skepticism. Such a high projection requires careful scrutiny and is unlikely to be sustainable.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Bitcoin Bounces, But Strategy's Buying Power Is Low On Fuel:**  This suggests that MSTR's performance, heavily tied to Bitcoin, may be constrained by limited capital.

**Analysis:**

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출      |
|------------|-------|-----------|

*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are very high, consistently above 68%.
*   **Equity:** Equity has grown substantially over the period, likely driven by appreciation in the value of Bitcoin holdings and stock price increases.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is highly volatile, reflecting the fluctuations in earnings. The most recent quarters are positive, but previous quarters show negative ROE.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Outperformance & Volatility:** MSTR has dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 in recent years, but with extremely high volatility and drawdowns. This is reflected in both the return rate comparison and the Alpha/Beta analysis.
*   **Bitcoin Dependence:** MSTR's performance is heavily tied to Bitcoin. This is evident in the news headlines, the volatility in EPS, and the rapid growth in equity (likely linked to Bitcoin's price appreciation). This reliance makes the stock highly speculative.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators (RSI, SMAs) give mixed signals, suggesting some short-term uncertainty.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts are generally bullish, with a "Strong Buy" consensus and a high average target price. However, the wide range in target prices underscores the uncertainty and risk associated with the stock.
*   **Financial Performance:** Revenue is stable, and profit margins are high, but ROE is volatile. The company's equity has grown significantly, but this is likely due to Bitcoin appreciation rather than consistent operational profitability.
*   **Risk Factors:** Key risks include:
    *   **Bitcoin volatility:** MSTR's performance is highly dependent on Bitcoin's price.
    *   **High volatility:** The stock is prone to large price swings.
    *   **Speculative nature:** The stock is driven by sentiment and speculation.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests that MSTR is a buy but has not considered many fundamental/external factors.

**Conclusion:**

MSTR presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. Its recent performance has been exceptional, but it is heavily reliant on Bitcoin and prone to extreme volatility. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in MSTR. The recent downward trend in price and divergence, along with the news headlines, suggest some caution may be warranted. While analysts are generally bullish, the uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin and the company's strategic direction should not be ignored.
