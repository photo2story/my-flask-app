| 2023-2025  | -59.0%  | 84.0%  | -122.0% | 3.1    | 24.7   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Highly variable, ranging from -59% to 130%, indicating inconsistent growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD values (67.2% - 84%) suggest significant price volatility and risk.

*   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuate, but generally increase over time, especially recently. A beta of 3.1 for 2023-2025 shows the stock is now far more sensitive to market movements than the market itself.

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Disparity Change:** 2.1 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 55.7% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

FSLR presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negatives:** Underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high MDD, and a potentially overbought RSI. The fluctuating earnings and ROE indicate some inconsistency in performance. The recent performance relative to the S\&P500 has been relatively poor.

**Recommendation:**  Based on the data, FSLR appears to be a potentially interesting investment, but with significant risk. Due to approaching the overbought conditions and recent poor performance relative to the S\&P500, you may want to consider a wait-and-see approach and observe the next few periods.
