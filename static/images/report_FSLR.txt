FSLR has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.  However, its performance is volatile.

Investors should carefully consider the risk associated with this volatility and the company's sensitivity to market fluctuations before making investment decisions.  The high profit margins and growing equity are positive indicators, but further due diligence, including examining the duplicated data point in the earnings report and understanding the drivers of the company's volatility, is strongly recommended.  The high projected return should be viewed with caution given the observed historical volatility.
