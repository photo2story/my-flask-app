## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of solar panels.  Its cumulative return of 218.03% significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 130.06%.  The difference is 87.97%, placing it at the 42.6th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  While this demonstrates strong relative performance, the high beta values (ranging from 5.0 to 18.0 in provided data) suggest significant volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $199.27 (Last market: $207.71)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $192.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $193.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $212.26

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. The recent market price of $207.71 shows a notable increase, indicating a potential recent rally, which should be further investigated with more data.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.01 – Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.87 – Indicates a bullish momentum, albeit relatively mild.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (-) – This suggests a recent short-term decline in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.  The lack of a numerical value prevents a precise analysis.
* **Expected Return:** 311.6% – This represents a significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500, assuming continuous investment. However, such projections should be viewed cautiously.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility.

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates between quarters, reaching a high of $1.01B in Q2 2024 and a low of $0.79B in Q1 2024.  No clear consistent upward or downward trend is evident from this limited data.
* **EPS:** EPS also varies, reaching a high of $3.26 in Q2 2024 and a low of $2.21 in Q1 2024.  Similar to revenue, there's no strong, easily discernible trend here.  A duplicate entry for 2024-10-29 exists which needs to be clarified.
* **Comparison:** Without prior expectations, it is not possible to determine whether these results beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is fluctuating, and Profit Margins show some variation, peaking at 50.17% in Q3 2024 and showing a notable drop to 43.57% in Q1 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is generally increasing, and ROE shows fluctuations but remains mostly positive.  Again, more detailed analysis would benefit from a longer time frame.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information.  The prompt does not provide any recent news, market outlook, or analyst opinions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500,  indicated by its high cumulative return. However, this has been accompanied by significant volatility as evidenced by the high beta values. Recent price action shows a short-term downtrend, but the latest market close indicates a recent potential rally.  Earnings data shows variability in both revenue and EPS.  More comprehensive data (including analyst expectations and recent news) would facilitate a more precise and nuanced analysis. The high expected return should be considered cautiously, as such projections often contain significant uncertainty.  Technical indicators provide a mixed signal; while the PPO suggests bullish momentum, the price is trading below key moving averages.
