## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Investment Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels.  The cumulative return of FSLR over the analyzed period is 193.42%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.37%.  The difference is 75.0 percentage points.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, places FSLR in the 39.9th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO.  This suggests a considerable outperformance but also a degree of volatility.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent Alpha and Beta values over time, all hovering around 0 for Alpha, and around 21 for Beta. The varying CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures further highlight the risk and volatility associated with the stock.  Further analysis is needed to determine if this volatility is inherent to the renewable energy sector or specific to FSLR's business model. Consistent high beta suggests high market sensitivity.  Zero Alpha could indicate the return largely follows the market, despite the high CAGR in some periods.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $192.88
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $187.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $185.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $192.75

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  However, the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 60-day MA indicates a lack of significant momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.74 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.53 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.2 (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 123.3% (Significant outperformance compared to S&P 500)

The recent price increase (+1.04%) is noteworthy but doesn't signal a dramatic change in trend. The divergence between the short-term bearish divergence and the positive PPO and positive expected return suggests further analysis is required to resolve this conflicting information.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR shows strong long-term growth potential, indicated by the high cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, the stock's volatility and inconsistent historical performance require careful consideration.  The high beta suggests significant market risk.  While the current technical indicators and expected return paint a somewhat positive picture, the conflicting signals and the need to verify the earnings data necessitate further investigation before making any investment decisions.  A more in-depth analysis of the company's competitive landscape, future growth projections, and potential risks is recommended.
