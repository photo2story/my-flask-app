**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels.  The cumulative return of FSLR over the analyzed period is 183.67%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 113.65%.  The difference is 70.0 percentage points.  While the provided relative divergence of 38.4% suggests a strong outperformance relative to its historical range against the S&P 500, it's crucial to remember this is a relative measure based on past performance and doesn't guarantee future results.  The provided CAGR data shows high volatility in performance year over year.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $186.47
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $181.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $189.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $195.92

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting potential downward pressure in the short term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (38.4):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.31):**  Negative value indicates bearish momentum.

The current price of $186.47 does not reflect a significant recent price jump or drop. A potential bounce is suggested by the RSI and the positive 20-day relative divergence change.  The expected return of 127.7% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant projection and should be viewed cautiously, as it's based on historical data and future performance is uncertain.
