* **5-Day Moving Average:** $126.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $130.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $155.18

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent $1.28 increase may indicate a temporary rebound or the start of a new trend but requires further observation.

First Solar shows promising long-term growth potential within the renewable energy sector, as evidenced by the high expected return. However, the stock's performance is volatile and highly correlated with broader market trends. The recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and mixed technical indicators warrant caution.  A deeper dive into the drivers of earnings variability and a more comprehensive risk assessment are necessary before making any investment decisions.  Investors should carefully consider the inherent volatility and conduct further due diligence before investing.
