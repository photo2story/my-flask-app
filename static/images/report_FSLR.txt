## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Investment Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of solar energy panels.  The cumulative return of FSLR is 193.42%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 118.37%. The difference is 75.0 percentage points, placing it in the 39.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range (max: 274.6, min: -57.3).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided alpha values are consistently close to zero across different periods, indicating that FSLR's performance is largely explained by market movements (beta around 21).  However, the high CAGR values (especially in 2020-2022) and varying MDD (Maximum Drawdown) suggest periods of significant gains and losses.  The consistent beta around 21 indicates higher volatility compared to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $192.88
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $187.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $185.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $192.75

The price is slightly above the 60-day moving average, suggesting recent price stability or a minor upward trend.  The 5 and 20-day moving averages are below the current price, hinting at a potential short-term upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.74 - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.53 - A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although it's relatively low.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.2 - Indicates a recent slight decline in relative strength.

The current price ($192.88) is close to the 60-day moving average, indicating no significant recent price jumps (no indication of sharp upward or downward movement). The expected return of 123.3% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a considerable projection and should be treated cautiously.  This implies a significant outperformance expectation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While there's a general upward trend in revenue, the EPS fluctuates. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for this variability (e.g., seasonal effects, one-time expenses).  Note there is a duplicated entry for 2024-10-29.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue    |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2024-10-29 | 2.92 | $0.89B     |
| 2024-07-30 | 3.26 | $1.01B     |
| 2024-05-01 | 2.21 | $0.79B     |
| 2023-10-31 | 2.51 | $0.80B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some seasonality with higher revenue in Q2 2024. Profit margins are generally strong, though there is some fluctuation.  Equity is steadily increasing, reflecting a healthy financial position. ROE (Return on Equity) also shows some fluctuation, likely influenced by the variability in profit margins and earnings.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past, exhibiting high growth potential. However, this performance has been volatile. While recent technical indicators suggest a relatively neutral to slightly bullish outlook, the high beta suggests substantial risk. The long-term expected return is quite optimistic and should be interpreted with caution.  Earnings show some variability, needing further analysis to identify underlying drivers.  The company's financial health appears strong.  Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before making any decisions.  Further due diligence, including analysis of the company's future growth prospects, competitive landscape and potential risks, is crucial.
