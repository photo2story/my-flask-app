## First Solar Inc (FSLR) Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:**

First Solar, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels.  While its cumulative return (80.8%) lags behind the S&P 500's (91.2%), analysis reveals a high growth potential, supported by strong recent earnings and profitability, despite some recent price volatility.  However, significant risk is implied by the high beta and substantial price swings observed in recent years.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

First Solar's cumulative return of 80.84% underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) by 10.3 percentage points.  This places it at the 17th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a range of -55.1% to 208.3%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals significant volatility. While the company exhibits high growth potential (CAGR often exceeding 50%), the high beta (ranging from 4.5 to 18.2) indicates substantial sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Alphas fluctuate significantly suggesting periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  The high negative CAGR in 2023-2025 is particularly noteworthy and requires further investigation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

FSLR presents a complex investment picture.  While exhibiting high growth potential and strong profitability,  its high beta and significant price volatility introduce substantial risk.  The negative CAGR projection for 2023-2025 raises serious concerns.  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation is critical, including understanding the reasons behind the volatile earnings and the projected negative CAGR. The high projected long-term return should be viewed with extreme caution and requires careful consideration of the inherent risks.  A thorough review of industry trends, competitive landscape, and the company's future strategic plans is essential.  Consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
