**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock price experienced a recent surge, closing at $136.23 after a significant daily increase of $4.94 (3.8%).  The price is currently below both its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but significantly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent pullback from a higher price range.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 55.49 indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The PPO of 1.15 suggests upward momentum. The recent relative divergence increase of 7.0 points to short-term upward pressure. The MRI of 0.43 suggests a medium-risk level.  The significant daily price increase indicates a sharp rebound.  The projected 227.4% expected return over the long term (2+ years) represents a substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this projection should be viewed with caution given the inherent volatility in the data and the long-term nature of the forecast.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue has generally trended upwards, EPS shows fluctuations.  Further analysis of the underlying drivers of these fluctuations would be necessary for a complete understanding.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR shows promising performance, outperforming the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  However, its historical volatility and the recent price surge warrant caution. While the long-term expected return is substantial, it's critical to consider the inherent risks associated with investing in a company in the renewable energy sector, which is subject to significant market and regulatory influences.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's future prospects, competitive landscape, and financial health beyond the provided data, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high beta values from the past indicate that FSLR is a riskier investment than the S&P 500.  Consider this high volatility when making investment choices.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data also needs clarification.
