### 2. Recent Stock Performance:

*   **Current Price:** 133.76
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 140.68, Previous Close: 133.76, Change: 5.17
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 129.6
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 130.21
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 135.25

**Analysis:** The recent price increase, as indicated by the `change` value of 5.17, suggests a positive short-term trend. The current price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, which could be interpreted as a bullish signal. However, the price is below the 60-day moving average, which might suggest some longer-term resistance. The fact that `{'price': 140.68, 'previousClose': 133.76, 'change': 5.17}` is a significant change highlights potential volatility or a recent catalyst.

### 3. Technical Indicators:

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3707 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 54.45
*   **PPO:** 0.151
*   **20-Day Relative Deviation Change:** 2.1 (Positive - Short-Term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 1139.0%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The low MRI suggests that, overall, the market conditions are relatively stable (at the time of the MRI calculation).
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 54.45 indicates a neutral to slightly bullish momentum, as it's above 50 but not yet in overbought territory (typically above 70).
*   **PPO:** The Positive PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which can be a bullish signal.
*   **Relative Deviation Change:** The positive change indicates short-term positive momentum relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return (1139.0%) is unrealistic and warrants further scrutiny. It likely arises from the recent high volitility and current market conditions, and this number cannot be used as an reliable investment indicator.
