**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** 0.11 – A slightly positive PPO suggests potential upward momentum.
* **Relative Strength:** -4.6% (20-day) – Indicates a recent weakening in relative performance compared to the market.
* **Expected Return:** 335.6% – This extremely high projected return should be viewed with caution.  Such projections are highly dependent on various assumptions and market conditions and aren't guaranteed. The 335.6% figure likely reflects the historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500 and should not be interpreted as a definitive forecast. A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) would likely be needed to see this return.

However, this needs to be considered along with other risk factors.
