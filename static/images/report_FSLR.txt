## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of solar panels.  The cumulative return of FSLR is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last data point, FSLR outperformed VOO by 33.6 percentage points (154.66% vs 121.09%).  While the relative divergence of 27.4% indicates a strong outperformance compared to its historical range, it's crucial to remember this is relative to past performance and doesn't predict future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha values are consistently near zero, suggesting FSLR's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta).  However, the high beta values (4.5 to 18.9) indicate high volatility, meaning FSLR's price tends to fluctuate more than the overall market.  Note the significant variation in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different periods.  This highlights the risk associated with this investment. The dramatic swings in CAGR from period to period indicate strong market sensitivity and susceptibility to external factors.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $167.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $165.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $180.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $188.92

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates recent price stability, but the larger gap from the 20 and 60-day moving averages suggests a longer term downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 30.54 – This suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.10 –  A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.5 – This indicates a recent short-term decline in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** 220.8% – This indicates a significantly higher expected return than the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), but it is crucial to remember that this is just an expectation and subject to high market volatility given the characteristics of FSLR.
* **Recent Price Change:** The positive price change of $0.83 reflects a slight upward movement, but this is not significant enough to suggest a sharp rebound given the context of the moving averages and other indicators.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some variability.  Revenue and EPS have fluctuated, without a clear upward or downward trend.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying reasons for this volatility.  A simple comparison of the two entries for 2024-10-29 shows inconsistent data entry and needs correction.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates but generally shows growth. Profit margins are strong and generally maintain above 40%, although there's some quarter-to-quarter variance.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily increasing, showing a healthy financial position. ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, suggesting some variability in profitability.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown a strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, it's crucial to recognize the high volatility indicated by its high beta and fluctuating CAGR. The current technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the price is still trending downwards. While the long-term expected return is substantial, this is dependent on the continued success of FSLR and the renewable energy market, while also being subject to significant market volatility given its high beta. Investors should be aware of the considerable risk associated with this stock due to its high volatility.  Further investigation into the reasons for revenue and EPS fluctuation, and a more thorough risk assessment, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistent data in the earnings reports is concerning and needs clarification.
