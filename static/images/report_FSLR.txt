**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

First Solar Inc. is a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels.  Over the reviewed period, FSLR's cumulative return significantly lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO), underperforming by 27.0%.  While this difference seems substantial, the relative divergence of 13.4% suggests that this level of underperformance is not unprecedented within the historical context of FSLR's performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating Alpha and Beta values. While some periods exhibit positive Alpha (outperformance), many show negative Alpha indicating underperformance relative to the market.  The Beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, is generally high, suggesting significant market sensitivity. The high volatility is also evident in the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures, especially in the 2016-2018 and 2023-2025 periods.  This highlights significant risk associated with FSLR investment.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (46.71):**  Approaching oversold territory (below 50), suggesting potential for a short-term bounce.
* **PPO (0.7565):**  Positive value suggests upward momentum, although the proximity to zero may indicate weakening momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +5.8%, indicating a recent short-term upward trend.

* **Expected Return:** The projected 504.2% long-term return (2+ years) seems exceptionally high and requires further investigation and validation to determine its reliability.  It's crucial to consider this projection in light of the high risk indicated by the MRI and past volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  A further analysis to see if revenue and EPS are increasing at a faster or slower rate than the market would provide a more reliable performance comparison.  More detailed information on the drivers of these fluctuations would be needed for a complete assessment.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

FSLR has demonstrated significant volatility and market sensitivity. While its long-term growth potential in the renewable energy sector is promising,  the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and high risk indicators warrant caution.  The high projected long-term return should be viewed with skepticism until further investigation confirms its validity.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk profile and volatility before investing, potentially diversifying their portfolio to mitigate risk.  More in-depth analysis including a comparison of revenue and EPS growth against market benchmarks and detailed examination of the drivers behind the variability in financial metrics is recommended.
