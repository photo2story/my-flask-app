FSLR demonstrates strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500,  indicated by high cumulative returns and consistently positive alpha values.

The oversold RSI suggests potential for a rebound, but this should be viewed alongside other indicators and market conditions.  Current information is vital to complete the analysis.
