**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the provided historical period.  However, recent price action suggests a short-term decline, possibly related to the variation in reported revenue and EPS.  The high beta implies significant market sensitivity. While long-term projections suggest substantial returns, the quarterly earnings data shows some volatility and requires further context to fully understand the underlying trends.  The missing news and analyst data hinder a complete assessment of the current market sentiment and expectations.  The high CAGR and substantial MDD figures point to substantial risk and reward.  Further investigation of the reported earnings figures (particularly resolving the duplicate entry) is necessary for a complete assessment. The high projected long-term return should be considered in the context of this volatility.
