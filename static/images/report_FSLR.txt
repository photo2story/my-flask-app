## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Investment Review

This report analyzes First Solar Inc. (FSLR), a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar photovoltaic modules, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

FSLR's cumulative return (172.35%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (115.96%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 56.4%, placing it in the 34.3rd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a min/max range of -57.3% to 274.6%).  This suggests strong relative performance, although past performance does not guarantee future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $178.07
* **5-day Moving Average:** $183.40
* **20-day Moving Average:** $192.37
* **60-day Moving Average:** $197.56

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend in the short-to-medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (30.22):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.59):**  Shows a negative momentum, aligning with the moving averages suggesting a bearish trend.
* **20-day Relative Strength Divergence (-1.7):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (151.2%):**  A high expected return over two years, exceeding the S&P 500 significantly.  However, this needs further context regarding the methodology and assumptions behind this projection.  The current price ($178.07) being below the moving averages doesn't directly signal a rapid increase or decrease, but it does imply some bearish pressure.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Shows fluctuation, with a peak of $1.01B in Q2 2024 and a subsequent decline to $0.89B in Q3 2024.  There is no clear consistent upward trend.
* **EPS:** Similarly fluctuates, reaching a high of $3.26 in Q2 2024 before falling to $2.92 in Q3 2024.  Again, no consistent upward trend is evident.
* **Comparison:**  There isn't a consistent pattern of increasing EPS or revenue quarter-over-quarter.  Missing data on earnings expectations prevents a conclusive analysis of "beats" or "misses."

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue varies, impacting profit margins.  Profit margins are generally high (40-50%) but not consistently increasing.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has increased steadily, and ROE shows some fluctuation but remains positive, suggesting overall financial health.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown significantly stronger returns than the S&P 500 historically. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend.  While the long-term expected return is high, this needs further validation.  The earnings data displays volatility without a consistent upward trend.  The company's financial health appears stable, with high profit margins, but revenue and EPS show fluctuation.  Missing news and analyst data limit a complete assessment of current market sentiment and short-term outlook.  More information is needed regarding the expected return calculation and the context of the recent price movements to provide more robust investment advice.
