**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $166.01
* **5-day Moving Average:** $166.58
* **20-day Moving Average:** $181.22
* **60-day Moving Average:** $189.38

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The recent price increase (3.6%) may indicate short-term volatility, but the longer-term trend appears bearish.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 26.05 (Suggests oversold conditions, potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -1.32 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -2.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 223.7% (Significantly higher than S&P 500)


The recent price increase, while positive, should be viewed within the context of the overall downward trend suggested by the moving averages and the negative PPO.  The high expected return needs further scrutiny to assess its feasibility and justify the risk.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, however, this historical outperformance is not a guarantee of future success. The high Beta indicates significant risk associated with the stock.  While current technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, the downward price trend and negative PPO signal caution.  Strong profit margins and increasing equity are positive financial indicators.  A more in-depth analysis, including competitive landscape analysis, future growth prospects, and risk assessment is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The projected high long-term return should be treated with skepticism unless supported by robust forecasting models.
