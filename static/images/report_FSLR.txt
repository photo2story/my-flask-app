| 2023-2025   | -180.0%| 82.2%  | -226.0%| 1.0    | 17.7   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** First Solar's growth rates have fluctuated significantly over the years, with some periods showing substantial growth (e.g., 2020-2022) and others experiencing losses (e.g., 2016-2018, 2023-2025). The most recent period, 2023-2025, shows a dramatic decline with a CAGR of -180%.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown values are consistently high, indicating that the stock has experienced significant declines from peak to trough in each period. This suggests higher volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha values vary widely. Positive alpha values (e.g., 2020-2022) indicate that First Solar outperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) after adjusting for risk, while negative alpha values (e.g., 2023-2025) indicate underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, with some periods having negative betas. A beta close to zero indicates that the stock's returns are not highly correlated with the overall market. The recent increase in beta to 0.7 for 2021-2025 and beyond suggests a stronger correlation with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has generally increased over the years, peaking at $18.9 billion in 2022-2024, though slightly declining in the most recent period.

### 2. Recent Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** 165.14
*   **Previous Close:** 165.48
*   **Change:** -0.21

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 161.303
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 151.8627

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly down from the previous close. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which could be interpreted as a short-term upward trend. However, the fact that the price is below the 5-day moving average suggests a recent pullback.  The small negative change from the previous close doesn't indicate a major volatility event, but continued monitoring is needed.

*   **Expected Return:** 807.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.3373 indicates a low-risk environment.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 45.21 is neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The PPO of 1.0736 indicates that the 20-day exponential moving average is slightly above the 60-day exponential moving average, suggesting a slight upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying 80% of available cash, but with caution, based on the MRI.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests that FSLR may be starting to close the performance gap with the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return of 807.6% should be interpreted with caution. Such a high projection is unlikely and suggests the model might be overoptimistic or based on specific assumptions that may not hold true. This figure represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 from a long-term (2+ years) dollar-cost averaging strategy starting from the current point.
