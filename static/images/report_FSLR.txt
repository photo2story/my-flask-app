**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

First Solar (FSLR) has shown a cumulative return of 35.51% over the review period, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has returned 78.93%.  This represents a lag of -43.4 percentage points.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

First Solar exhibits high growth potential in the renewable energy sector, but its performance is highly volatile and sensitive to market fluctuations.  The recent price drop and conflicting signals from the expected return and other indicators require further investigation.  The high projected return requires careful review of its calculation. The company's financial health appears strong, with consistent profitability and increasing equity. However, before making any investment decisions, further due diligence is strongly recommended to understand the drivers of the high volatility and the extremely high projected return.  Independent verification of the data, particularly the historical CAGR and MDD figures, is crucial.
