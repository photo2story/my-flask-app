**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2024-2026  | 95.0% | 84.0% | -11.0% | 0.0 | 28.2 |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 95.0% indicates substantial growth over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 84.0% represents a very significant potential loss from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** -11.0% suggests underperformance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500), aligning with the return rate comparison.  A negative alpha means the investment has generated less return than expected for the risk taken.
*   **Beta:** 0.0 indicates that the stock's returns are uncorrelated to the market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** $28.2 Billion market cap suggests it's a large-cap company.

*   **Analysis:** The high CAGR is attractive, but the very high MDD indicates significant volatility and risk. The negative alpha reinforces the underperformance compared to the market. The beta of zero suggests the price is uncorrelated to the broader market.

*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 262.585, Previous Close: 264.3, Change: -0.65
*   **5-day SMA:** 268.768

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently slightly below the 5-day SMA and slightly above the 20-day SMA. The 60-day SMA is significantly lower than the other SMAs. This suggests a short-term downtrend (price below 5-day SMA) but a longer-term uptrend (60-day SMA lower than the current price). The recent change of -0.65 suggests a very minor fluctuation.

*   **Expected Return (%):** 21.5%

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. The RSI is neutral. The PPO shows a slight bullish trend, but that should be read with caution since RSI is neutral. The hybrid signal suggests a high conviction buy. The recent negative change in relative divergence indicates short-term downward pressure, which explains a higher confidence (buying) of the stock. The expected return is quite positive.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

First Solar shows a mixed picture:

*   **Positives:** Strong analyst consensus ("Buy"), increasing revenue and EPS, expanding footprint (as reported in news), increasing equity, high CAGR. MRI indicates medium investment recommendation.
*   **Negatives:** Underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high MDD (significant volatility), recent short-term decline.

**Overall Assessment:**

First Solar is a company with strong growth potential in the renewable energy sector. However, it carries significant risk and volatility, as evidenced by its MDD. The analyst consensus and positive news suggest potential upside, but investors should be aware of the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and potential short-term decline. The recommendation would be "Buy", but proceed with caution, especially considering the high Maximum Drawdown.
