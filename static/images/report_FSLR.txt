**6. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown significant long-term growth, outperforming the S&P 500 in recent years. However, historical volatility is a concern.

The predicted long-term expected return is substantial, but requires validation with a reliable source.  The lack of crucial financial data significantly limits a thorough evaluation. Further investigation into the source of the expected return figure and obtaining complete financial data is crucial before forming a conclusive opinion.  The high variability of performance highlights the risk involved in investing in FSLR.
