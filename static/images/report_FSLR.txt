2025-01-26 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of First Solar Inc. (FSLR) based on the provided data.  I will address each point separately, then provide a final summary.


**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO)**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading provider of solar energy solutions.

The cumulative return of FSLR is 155.97%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 52.12%. The difference is 103.85%.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, is at the 35th percentile. This indicates that while FSLR has significantly outperformed VOO, it's not an outlier compared to its past performance range.

The provided CAGR data shows significant year-over-year variability, highlighting the cyclical nature of the solar energy sector.  While recent years have shown strong performance (with CAGRs exceeding 80% in some periods), the projected CAGR for 2023-2025 is negative. This underscores the need for a long-term perspective when assessing the investment. Alpha consistently remains around 1.0, suggesting performance is in line with the market's risk-adjusted return, while Beta significantly exceeds 1.0, indicating a higher sensitivity to market fluctuations than the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement**

* **Current Price:** $168.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $178.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $184.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $191.24

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price drop (-3.37% from the previous close) indicates a short-term bearish sentiment.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **RSI (35.72):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.88):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-10.7%):**  Confirms a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return (241.9%):**  This high projected return over the long term (2+ years) reflects the potential for significant outperformance against the S&P 500, but requires a long-term perspective and carries substantial risk. The significant negative change from the previous close warrants caution.  The current price action could suggest a potential short-term rebound, but the underlying trend remains bearish, according to the indicators.

**8.  Final Report (English)**

**First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Investment Analysis**

**Executive Summary:**

First Solar (FSLR) demonstrates a strong long-term growth trajectory, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the past periods. However, recent performance reveals a short-term bearish trend, evidenced by price action below key moving averages and negative technical indicators (RSI, PPO).  While the company shows strong fundamentals, including healthy profit margins and increasing equity, recent quarterly results require further scrutiny due to a decline in Q3 2024 revenue and EPS.  A long-term investment strategy is recommended, but careful risk management is essential due to sector volatility.

**Performance:**

FSLR's cumulative return drastically surpasses VOO's, highlighting substantial outperformance.  However,  year-over-year CAGR figures demonstrate significant variability, characteristic of the cyclical solar energy sector.  Alpha values consistently hover around 1.0, indicating performance aligning with market-adjusted returns, whereas a Beta significantly above 1.0 points to higher market sensitivity.

**Price Trend:**

The current price sits below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent price drop further reinforces this.

**Technical Indicators:**

RSI and PPO indicators are in oversold and bearish territory, respectively. The recent decline in relative strength underscores the current downward trend.

**Financial Health:**

Profit margins remain consistently high, above 40%, demonstrating strong profitability.  Equity is steadily growing, reflecting a solid financial position.  ROE fluctuates but generally indicates adequate return on equity. However, Q3 2024 earnings showed a decline requiring further investigation.

**Earnings Analysis:**

Inconsistencies in the provided earnings data require clarification, particularly the duplication of the 2024-10-29 entry.  A thorough analysis of earnings data is necessary to confirm the trend.

**Recommendation:**

While FSLR possesses significant long-term growth potential and strong fundamentals, the current short-term bearish trend and the need for clarification on the earnings data suggest a cautious approach.  Investors should carefully consider the inherent volatility of the solar energy sector before making investment decisions. Long-term investors with a high-risk tolerance may consider FSLR, but close monitoring of market conditions and financial reports is crucial.  Further analysis into the Q3 2024 earnings decline is paramount.
