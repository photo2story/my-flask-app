**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show inconsistent performance relative to the market (S&P 500).  High positive alphas (e.g., 0.8 in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024) suggest outperformance, while negative alphas suggest underperformance.

Recent earnings show some growth in revenue but fluctuating profitability.  A deeper dive into the drivers of these fluctuations, along with a more detailed understanding of the assumptions behind the projected return, is necessary before drawing definitive conclusions about FSLR's investment prospects.  Caution is advised due to the significant historical volatility.
