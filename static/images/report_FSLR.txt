| 2023-2025  | -40.0%  | 84.0%   | -104.0% | 3.1    | 27.7   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Varies significantly, showing periods of strong growth (e.g., 2020-2022) and decline (e.g., 2016-2018, 2023-2025). This indicates volatility.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high drawdowns indicate a significant level of risk associated with the stock.  Values around 80% suggest a very volatile investment.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures performance relative to a benchmark.  Negative Alpha values (e.g., -47.0%, -13.0%, -104.0%) indicate underperformance, while positive values (e.g., 9.0%, 11.0%, 131.0%, 31.0%, 1.0%) indicate outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures volatility relative to the market.  Betas close to 0 (or even negative values) suggest that FSLR is less correlated with the overall market, especially in earlier periods. Recent higher betas indicate a recent correlation to the market but with very high volatility, making it very sensitive to market movements. A beta of 3.1 suggests FSLR is significantly more volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Indicates First Solar's market capitalization in billions. It has generally increased over time, suggesting company growth, especially notable increases more recently.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 258.51
*   **Previous Close:** 255.89 (Change: 1.02)
*   **5-day SMA:** 260.85
*   **20-day SMA:** 258.55
*   **60-day SMA:** 246.54

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA and roughly equal to the 20-day SMA, but above the 60-day SMA. This suggests that the stock is in a short-term consolidation phase.
*   The price increase of 1.02 from the previous close suggests a slightly positive movement.

**3) Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 48.79 (Neutral)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.39 (Neutral)
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (3 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.9 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 26.1%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk, indicating that FSLR carries moderate risk compared to other investment opportunities.
*   The RSI of 48.79 is neutral, implying that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   The PPO is slightly negative, suggesting the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average. This indicates the potential for a bearish trend or continued consolidation.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" indicates a strong buy recommendation from the algorithm suggesting purchasing 100% of the company's shares.
*   The recent increase in relative divergence suggests short-term upward momentum.
*   The high expected return of 26.1% compared to the S&P 500 implies the potential for significant outperformance in the long term (over 2 years), though this comes with the risks highlighted above.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.64)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 274.14 / 335.00 / 150.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is a "Buy" with a mean rating suggesting a positive outlook. The average target price of 274.14 suggests potential upside from the current price (258.51). However, the wide range between the high and low target prices (335.00 and 150.00, respectively) indicates a considerable level of uncertainty among analysts.

*   **Financial Health:** ROE levels are somewhat promising, but need to be considered with the decreasing margin of profit, it shows inefficiencies.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analyst consensus is positive, but the range of target prices indicates uncertainty.
*   **News:** The news is generally positive, highlighting strong execution and AI potential, but also noting competitive pressures.

**Conclusion:**

FSLR is a potentially high-reward, high-risk investment. The company shows strong growth potential and positive recent momentum, but also exhibits high volatility and has underperformed the S&P 500 in the recent past. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in FSLR. The analyst's buy rating and the algorithm's positive prediction must be measured and compared carefully with maximum drawdown, high volatility (beta), and underperformance of the S&P 500, and consider how well it can be sustained with the decline in the profit margin.
