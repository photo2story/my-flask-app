## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

FSLR's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period. While FSLR showed a 98.17% return, VOO achieved 104.98%, resulting in a negative divergence of -6.8%.  The relative divergence of -15.9% places its performance in the lower portion of its historical range against the S&P 500.  Further analysis is needed to determine the drivers behind this underperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

First Solar Inc. is a leading manufacturer of solar panels.

The provided alpha and beta data show significant volatility in performance relative to the market (Beta) and inconsistent alpha (outperformance relative to market risk).  While some periods show strong positive alpha (e.g., 2021-2023, 2022-2024), others show substantial negative alpha (e.g., 2016-2018, 2023-2025).  The high beta values suggest significant market sensitivity. Market cap also shows considerable fluctuation over the years.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 50.0% | 21.4% | 21.0% | -0.1 | 7.2 |
| 2016-2018  | -46.0% | 21.4% | -64.0% | -0.2 | 4.5 |
| 2017-2019  | 49.0% | 21.4% | 19.0% | -0.4 | 6.0 |

| 2019-2021  | 57.0% | 19.8% | -14.0% | 0.1 | 9.3 |
| 2020-2022  | 165.0% | 19.8% | 0.1 | 16.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 85.0% | 17.7% | 1.2 | 18.4 |
| 2022-2024  | 123.0% | 21.9% | 1.1 | 18.9 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $131.32
* **5-day Moving Average:** $129.90
* **20-day Moving Average:** $135.88
* **60-day Moving Average:** $161.60

The price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $2.23 (from $128.46) represents a modest positive change, but it's not sufficient to overturn the overall downward trend indicated by the moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 54.32 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.32 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum but not extremely strong)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.8 (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return:** 481.3% (This exceptionally high projected return requires careful scrutiny and likely relies on highly optimistic projections.)  This figure requires additional context to be meaningfully interpreted.

The recent price increase is not drastic enough to constitute a "sudden surge" or "sharp drop." The high expected return should be viewed cautiously.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR's performance has been volatile, significantly influenced by market movements (high beta).  While showing periods of strong growth and positive alpha, it has also experienced substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500, particularly recently.  The high expected return needs substantial justification and seems overly optimistic based on current trends.  Financial data indicates strong profit margins but volatile revenue.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the drivers of revenue and earnings fluctuations, as well as a more realistic assessment of future expectations, is needed before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The duplicate data entry needs clarification.  The provided data suggests a potentially risky investment due to volatility and inconsistent performance.
