**6) Overall Analysis:**

First Solar shows strong revenue and profitability but has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly in recent times.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with some suggesting potential short-term upward momentum, but the longer-term trend and high risk indicators necessitate caution.  The high projected return needs further justification.  Further analysis, incorporating industry trends, macroeconomic conditions, and a more detailed examination of financial statements, is required for a comprehensive investment decision.  The inconsistencies in the provided alpha/beta data warrant further investigation into the methodology and data sources.  The significant drop in CAGR from 2022-2024 should be a major concern.  Data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) require careful verification.
