## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels.  Over the analyzed period, FSLR's cumulative return (212.11%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (124.78%), exhibiting a difference of 87.33%.  This places FSLR's performance at the 42.41 percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (max: 283.74%, min: -57.29%).  The provided alpha values generally indicate consistent outperformance relative to the market (Beta > 1), although this varies from year to year.  High betas also indicate higher risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $195.56 (Last Market: $195.67)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $189.11
* **20-day Moving Average:** $197.11
* **60-day Moving Average:** $216.81

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and last market price indicates minimal fluctuation since the last market close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.68 (slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.13 (positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but relatively weak)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.05 (short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 18.69% (Long-term expected excess return over S&P 500)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO is positive, the negative relative divergence and the RSI near the midline suggest caution. The 18.69% expected return is a significant potential upside, but requires a long-term (2+ years) perspective.  The closing price is very close to the last market price which means there is no significant recent jump or fall.


**4. Recent Financials and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While the Q2 2024 results were strong, subsequent quarters showed a slight decline in revenue and EPS.  Missing information on analyst estimates for the latest reported quarter (Oct 29, 2024) prevents a thorough comparison to expectations.  A complete financial analysis requires more data and a detailed comparison to industry benchmarks and analyst expectations.


**5.  Revenue and Profitability:**

The revenue and profitability data shows a generally positive trend with some quarterly fluctuations. Profit margins are strong, ranging from 43% to over 50%. However, a detailed analysis requires understanding the drivers behind the quarterly variations.  The decrease in ROE in Q1 and Q3 2024 is noteworthy and needs further investigation.

**6. Capital and Profitability:**

Equity has shown consistent growth, indicating financial health. The ROE is relatively stable but fluctuates, suggesting potential challenges in maintaining consistent profitability.  Further analysis is needed to understand the factors affecting ROE changes.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.  However, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  While long-term prospects appear positive, given the high expected return, the mixed technical indicators and some variability in recent financial performance necessitate cautious optimism.  Further investigation into the latest earnings report compared to analyst expectations and a deeper dive into the causes of recent quarterly fluctuations are crucial for a comprehensive investment decision.  The high Beta suggests higher risk, and investors need to consider their risk tolerance.  News and analyst opinions will inform the current market outlook.
