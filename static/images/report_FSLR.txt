**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of current market outlook and analyst sentiment is impossible based on the given data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

First Solar demonstrates strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, with a significantly higher cumulative return. Recent price action shows some short-term weakness, but the stock remains above its shorter-term moving averages. Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with a slightly bearish short-term trend but generally positive long-term outlook suggested by the expected return. Financial data indicates high and relatively stable profitability, and growing equity. However, the absence of recent news and analyst sentiment, alongside the volatility in quarterly earnings, makes a definitive short-term conclusion difficult.  The high projected long-term return is notable but must be viewed with substantial caution given the inherent unpredictability of future market performance.  More information is needed to support the projected 290.8% return over the long-term.
