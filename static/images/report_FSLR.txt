## First Solar Inc (FSLR) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

FSLR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a cumulative return considerably higher than the benchmark.  However, recent price action indicates a potential downturn.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance and the validity of the projected high expected return.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

First Solar Inc (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels.  FSLR's cumulative return (113.72%) exceeds that of the S&P 500 (VOO) (112.87%) by 0.85 percentage points.  The relative divergence indicates that FSLR's performance is currently near the median of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. While this is positive, the relatively low absolute difference in returns suggests the outperformance is not exceptionally strong.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data reveals a volatile history for FSLR, with significant swings in CAGR and MDD.  Alpha values fluctuate, indicating periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  The high Beta values (mostly above 4.5) suggest high sensitivity to market movements.  The most recent periods show positive alpha and high CAGR, indicating strong performance compared to the market in these periods.  However, the projected negative CAGR (-100%) for 2023-2025 needs careful consideration.

FSLR's recent price action shows a significant downward trend. The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating bearish momentum.  The substantial drop from the previous close (-9.98%) highlights a considerable negative price change.

* **20-day MA:** 160.66
* **60-day MA:** 178.44

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI (27.72) suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce. However, the negative PPO (-0.65) suggests bearish momentum. The recent relative divergence (-7.7%) further confirms the short-term downward trend. The significant price drop necessitates acknowledging a potential sharp decline. The projected expected return of 417.4% over the long term (2+ years) is exceptionally high and needs substantial validation considering the current market conditions and recent price volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Revenue and EPS show some fluctuation but generally trending upward, although the most recent data point for October 2024 shows a slight decrease in both.  More data is needed to confirm the long-term trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown periods of strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in recent years.  However, the high volatility, high beta, and recent sharp price decline raise concerns. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions and the long-term expected return is extremely high, the negative PPO and recent price action indicate bearish momentum.  The projected -100% CAGR for 2023-2025 is a major red flag requiring further investigation.  A more thorough analysis, including examining the drivers behind the recent price drop and a deeper dive into the company's financial health and future projections, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The extremely high projected expected return should be treated with significant skepticism.
