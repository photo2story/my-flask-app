**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis. This missing data is a major constraint.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown periods of strong performance relative to the S&P 500, but recent performance has lagged.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook. However, the high projected long-term return requires further scrutiny and justification of the data source. The lack of crucial financial data prevents a complete assessment of the company's financial health and future prospects. Further investigation is recommended before making any investment decisions, especially into the source of the long-term expected return figure and complete financial data.
