*   **RSI:** 75.70 (Overbought)

*   **Expected Return (%):** 1158.9% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The low MRI indicates a relatively low-risk market environment for this stock.
*   **RSI:** The high RSI value (75.70) suggests the stock is currently overbought, potentially indicating a higher probability of a price correction or consolidation.
*   **PPO:** The positive PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, confirming an upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests buying 90% of available cash, indicating a moderately bullish stance, tempered by the low-risk MRI.
*   **Relative Deviation Change:** The negative change in relative deviation suggests recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Last Market Data:** The recent price change of -3.82 suggests a short-term pullback.
