**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

First Solar's cumulative return (199.04%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (125.6%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 73.44%, placing it at the 38.33rd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (max difference: 283.74%, min difference: -57.29%).

**6. News and Recent Issues:** (Requires further research)

This section requires accessing recent news sources (like Shacknews, FINBOLD, etc.) within the last two days to analyze any earnings announcements, market outlook changes, analyst opinions, and other performance highlights.  This information would provide a crucial context to the current market situation of FSLR.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

First Solar demonstrates strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. While recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, the long-term outlook appears positive, supported by a relatively high expected return and generally healthy financial fundamentals. However, crucial information is missing regarding the most recent financial statement and news.  Incorporating this information, specifically any adjustments to the earnings estimations and any recent market or news information would allow for a far more comprehensive and thorough analysis.
