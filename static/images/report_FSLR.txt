Noteworthy is the significant increase in CAGR and a marked decrease in MDD from 2020-2024, reflecting substantial growth in recent years.

A more comprehensive analysis requires access to earnings estimates.

**5. Financial Information:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR shows strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the past period.  However, the stock exhibits considerable volatility. Recent price action suggests a potential short-term recovery. While technical indicators present a mixed signal, the high expected return, and strong historical performance warrant further investigation.  Earnings data shows variability but generally positive trends in both revenue and profitability. Further analysis is needed to incorporate external market data, analyst opinion, and future growth projections.  Given the volatility, a long-term investment approach with a clear risk tolerance is recommended.  The substantial variations in quarterly results suggest further investigation into the specifics of the company's operational cycles to validate the 300% return expectation.
