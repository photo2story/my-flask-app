## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of solar energy systems.  Over the period reviewed, FSLR's cumulative return (164.88%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (122.83%).  The difference is 42.0 percentage points.  Considering the provided historical range of divergence (max: 274.6, min: -57.3), the current divergence of 42.0 places FSLR at the 29.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  While this indicates better-than-average performance relative to the S&P 500 in this historical context, it doesn't guarantee future outperformance.  The alpha consistently shows near zero, indicating that the outperformance might be largely attributed to beta (market risk), and not due to unique manager skill. Beta, consistently around 19, indicates significant market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $174.11
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $182.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $185.23
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $191.74

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price change of $1.29 (approximately 0.75%) shows a minor increase compared to the previous close, however it remains below several moving averages indicating a potential short-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.44 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.55 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -7.7% (Recent short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 192.6% (This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500, assuming continued outperformance.  This is a forecast and should be treated cautiously.)


The relatively low RSI and negative PPO coupled with the negative relative divergence and the fact the current price is below its moving averages suggest a bearish short term trend. However, the considerable historic positive divergence and the high expected return suggest potential for long-term growth.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent, with duplicate entries for 2024-10-29.  Assuming the duplicate is an error and focusing on unique entries, we see some volatility in both EPS and revenue.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downward trend.  The company displays strong profitability, but recent earnings data shows some volatility. While the high expected return and historically high divergence relative to the S&P 500 are encouraging for long-term investors,  the recent downward trend, coupled with inconsistent earnings data, warrants careful consideration before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence is recommended, including a deeper dive into the company's financial statements, future projections, and competitive landscape.  The relatively high beta also suggests increased risk.
