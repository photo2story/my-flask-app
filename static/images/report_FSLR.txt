## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules.  Over the period analyzed, FSLR significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for FSLR was 205.88%, while the S&P 500 returned 120.73%. This represents a difference of 85.2 percentage points. The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, sits at the 42.9th percentile.  This suggests strong performance relative to the market, though not consistently extreme.

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in FSLR's performance across different periods. While some years experienced massive growth (e.g., 165% from 2020-2022), others experienced substantial losses (-47% from 2016-2018). The beta values, fluctuating between 5.0 and 18.0, indicate high sensitivity to market movements. The consistently near-zero alpha suggests that the outperformance is largely explained by market-wide trends and the company's high beta.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $200.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $200.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $193.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $210.29

The price is currently below both the 60-day and slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting some recent price consolidation or a minor pullback after a potential upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.69  (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.81 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -3.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 301.1% (Significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500)

The indicators show a mixed picture. While the PPO suggests bullish momentum, the negative change in relative strength and a price slightly below the 60-day moving average indicate caution. The projected long-term return is substantial, but this is highly speculative and depends on numerous factors.  The current price near $200 is not exhibiting a significant recent rapid increase or decline.

The provided earnings data show some volatility:

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown substantial outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, but this performance has been highly volatile.  Recent price action suggests a potential pullback after a period of growth.  Technical indicators paint a mixed picture, and earnings data show inconsistent revenue and profit margin.  A long-term investment may be attractive, given the projected returns and long-term solar industry prospects, but investors must be prepared for substantial volatility.  Further investigation into recent news, analyst opinions, and industry trends is crucial before making an investment decision.  The high beta highlights a dependence on broader market conditions.  Additional data on analyst expectations for EPS and revenue would significantly improve the analysis.
