*   **Alpha:**  Wide range of alpha values, indicating inconsistent excess returns compared to the market. Notably, there is severely negative Alpha during the period of 2023-2025.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values are generally low (close to 0 or negative), suggesting FSLR's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, a cautious approach to FSLR is warranted. While analysts are generally positive, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, overbought RSI, high volatility, and strongly negative expected returns suggest that the stock may be overvalued or facing near-term headwinds. The company's recent earnings and revenue analysis shows inconsistency which leads to question future profitability. Investors should carefully weigh these factors and conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions.
