* **Closing Price:** $190.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $187.18
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $185.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $192.80

The current price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent minor price pullback after a period of growth.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.41 - Suggests positive momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -0.4 - Shows a slight recent downward trend.

Given the current price of $190.89 is relatively close to recent averages, there is no indication of a significant recent surge or drop.  The expected return of 124.5% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant projection and warrants further investigation into its assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  While revenue generally increases, EPS fluctuates.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of this variation and to assess the sustainability of current profit margins.

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is fluctuating, but profit margins remain relatively healthy, though showing some decline in recent quarters.  Equity is steadily increasing, and Return on Equity (ROE) shows some variability.  Further analysis should be performed to understand the underlying factors contributing to these trends.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown strong long-term growth exceeding the S&P 500. However, the company's performance has been volatile, with periods of significant gains and losses. While recent earnings and financial data indicate a generally healthy financial position, closer scrutiny is necessary to understand the variability in revenue and EPS, and the sustainability of its high profit margins.  The high beta suggests considerable market risk.  The projected 124.5% excess return over the S&P 500 needs thorough validation.  Further due diligence, including a comprehensive review of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility necessitates a thorough risk assessment before investing.
