**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows significant variability over different periods. High growth periods (e.g., 2020-2022 at 130%) are interspersed with periods of decline (e.g., 2016-2018 at -32% and 2023-2025 at -41%).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant price volatility and risk. Values consistently above 60% and reaching over 80% suggest substantial potential losses from peak to trough within those periods.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the investment's performance relative to the market. Positive Alpha values (e.g., 2020-2022 at 131%) mean the investment outperformed its benchmark, while negative values (e.g., 2023-2025 at -106%) mean it underperformed. The substantial positive Alpha in 2020-2022 highlights a period of significant outperformance, while the large negative Alpha in 2023-2025 suggests substantial underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the investment's volatility compared to the market. A Beta of 1 indicates volatility in line with the market, while values above 1 suggest higher volatility. The Beta values vary widely, from negative values indicating inverse correlation to high positive values in recent years. The sharp increase in Beta from 1.4 to 3.1 in the 2021-2023 and 2023-2025 periods suggests a significant increase in the stock's sensitivity to market movements, making it much more volatile relative to the market.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization generally increases over time, indicating growth in the company's overall value, although this does not guarantee positive returns for investors due to the stock's volatility.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 257.01
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 257.4, Previous Close: 262.56, Change: -1.97

*   **20-day SMA:** 262.54
*   **60-day SMA:** 238.06

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price closed lower than the previous day and also lower than the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. However, the 60-day SMA is significantly lower, indicating that the current price is still above the longer-term average. The price movement warrants attention to see if it confirms the downtrend.

*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a "Buy" rating based on the current indicators, emphasizing a "Very Safe" allocation with a 0% cash ratio, according to the MRI of 0.90. The signal suggests investing 100% of available cash by purchasing about 3 shares.
*   The 20-day relative divergence change indicates a short-term upward trend, which could be temporary.
*   An expected return of 21.3% suggests potential long-term gains if invested for over two years. However, this is only an expectation and not a guarantee.
