**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of solar panels.  The cumulative return of FSLR is 190.76%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 115.41% over the measured period.  The difference is 75.3 percentage points, placing it at the 40th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -57.3% and a maximum difference of 274.6%).

The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in performance across different periods, ranging from -47% to 165%.  The high Beta values (ranging from 5 to 18) indicate a high sensitivity to overall market movements, amplifying both gains and losses.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  However, its performance is highly volatile, as reflected in both the CAGR and Beta values.  The recent earnings data reveals some inconsistency in revenue and EPS growth. The high profit margins are a positive indicator, but the volatility needs to be considered. Further investigation is needed into the reasons behind the quarterly fluctuations in revenue and EPS, and also the duplicate data entry.  Additional data on recent news and analyst opinions are crucial for a more complete assessment.  The high expected return is promising, but the risk needs to be carefully evaluated due to FSLR's demonstrated volatility.
