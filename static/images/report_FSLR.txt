## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Investment Report

This report analyzes First Solar Inc. (FSLR), a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

FSLR's cumulative return (187.94%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.85%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 67.1%, placing it at the 37.5th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (max: 274.8%, min: -57.3%).  This suggests a strong historical outperformance, but this is relative and not a guarantee of future performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $188.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $195.16
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $195.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $205.86

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (46.59):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is due.  However, it's not definitively in oversold territory yet.
* **PPO (-0.19):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (-6.8%):**  Shows a recent weakening in relative strength compared to the market.
* **Expected Return (341.5%):** This exceptionally high expected return, relative to the S&P 500, should be treated with extreme caution.  Such projections are highly sensitive to assumptions and rarely accurate over extended periods.  It's crucial to understand the methodology behind this figure. The provided data doesn't include the necessary context for evaluating the validity of this high expected return.  The current price being below its moving averages already contradicts this overly optimistic prediction.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates significantly quarter-to-quarter, indicating potential seasonality or project-based revenue streams.  There's no clear upward trend.
* **EPS:**  EPS also fluctuates, with the highest value recorded in Q2 2024 ($3.26). There's no consistent upward or downward trend to establish a pattern.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Profit margins are generally high (above 40%), but also show variability, suggesting potential operational challenges or external market factors influencing profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is growing steadily, indicating a healthy financial position. ROE fluctuates, suggesting earnings are influenced by various factors.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided. This section requires additional information.  The absence of this critical data significantly hinders a complete analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn. While the company displays high profit margins and growing equity, the earnings data reveals significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, indicating a possible volatile business model. The exceptionally high projected long-term return needs thorough scrutiny and validation, considering it's at odds with present indicators.  Lack of recent news and analyst sentiment prevents a more complete assessment. The analysis is hampered by missing crucial information (e.g., details about the 341.5% expected return calculation, recent news and analyst opinions).  Further investigation is required before making any investment decision.


**8. Disclaimer:** This report is based solely on the data provided and does not constitute financial advice.  Independent research and consultation with a financial advisor are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The significant limitations in the provided data and the lack of critical information drastically reduce the reliability of this analysis.
