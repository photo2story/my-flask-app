**6. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown periods of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, driven by its position in the growing solar energy sector. However, it's a volatile stock with high beta, indicating substantial risk. The recent price drop is concerning and warrants further investigation into the underlying reasons.  While some technical indicators suggest potential for a rebound, the high expected return projection should be treated with caution due to the stock's inherent risk.  A comprehensive analysis should include a deeper review of the company's competitive landscape, future growth prospects, and a more detailed examination of the financial statements beyond the provided data.  The provided data alone is insufficient for a conclusive investment recommendation.
