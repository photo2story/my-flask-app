* **5-Day Moving Average:** $128.996
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $129.2075

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a more substantial downward trend over the longer term.  The recent price increase of $7.68 (from $120.38) shows a significant positive change, possibly indicating a temporary recovery or a market reversal.

* **PPO:** 0.6595 (Positive; suggests bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +2.7 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 629.2% (This extremely high value needs further clarification as to how it was derived.  It is likely not a realistic representation of future performance and warrants further investigation.)  Considering the volatility, this must be treated with extreme caution.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown periods of significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The company's financial performance is somewhat volatile, with inconsistent profit margins and ROE. While the recent price increase is positive, the long-term trend shows underperformance.  The high Market Risk Indicator suggests caution. The exceptionally high expected return of 629.2% requires further scrutiny and is unlikely to be realistic. A long-term investment strategy requires careful consideration of FSLR's inherent volatility and the potential for significant losses.  Further detailed analysis, including industry comparisons and a deeper dive into the company's future projections, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
