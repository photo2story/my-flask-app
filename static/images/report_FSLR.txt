## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Investment Review

This report analyzes First Solar Inc. (FSLR), a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

FSLR's cumulative return (180.97%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.68%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 60.3%, placing it at the 35.4th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a min/max range of -57.3% to 274.6%).  This suggests strong outperformance compared to the broader market, although the relative strength is not at an extreme historical high.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $183.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $182.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $193.92
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $199.37

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-to-medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (38.02):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. However, it's not definitively oversold.
* **PPO (-0.55):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-2.1):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (143.4%):** This indicates a significant potential for outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming a consistent performance like that shown historically.  The high expected return should be viewed with caution, considering that past performance does not guarantee future results.  The current price ($183.71) being below its moving averages doesn't suggest an immediate 143% return is imminent. Instead, it could be interpreted as a potential entry point for long-term investors willing to accept the short-term downward pressure.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates significantly across quarters, with no clear consistent upward or downward trend apparent in the short-term data.
* **EPS:** EPS also shows volatility, with a high in Q2 2024 ($3.26) and lower figures in subsequent quarters.  There is not enough data to determine a clear trend.
* **Comparison:**  A direct comparison with expected earnings is not possible without that information.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue varies considerably quarter to quarter. Profit margins are generally high (40-50%), although they've fluctuated slightly.  The drop in revenue and profit margin in Q3 2024 compared to Q2 2024 is notable and warrants further investigation beyond the scope of this data.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has steadily increased, indicating a healthy financial position. ROE is also variable but generally positive, suggesting reasonable profitability on equity.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR shows strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, with a considerable projected long-term return. However, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  Technical indicators are mixed, with the RSI near oversold levels, suggesting a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high-risk tolerance, although this should be considered alongside the recent downward trend.  Earnings data displays some volatility in both revenue and EPS, without clear directionality in the short-term.  The company appears financially healthy with strong profit margins, but further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind recent earnings variability and the broader market outlook.  The lack of information about recent news and analyst sentiment prevents a complete assessment.
