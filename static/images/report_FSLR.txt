## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

FSLR's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  While the provided data lacks complete financial statements, the available information suggests strong recent performance, although some volatility is apparent.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of solar panels.

* **Cumulative Return:** FSLR: 141.85%, VOO: 121.84%.  FSLR outperformed VOO by 20.01 percentage points.  The relative divergence is 23.3%, indicating that FSLR's performance is in the upper quartile relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500.
* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha and beta values show significant variation across different time periods, suggesting high volatility and sensitivity to market conditions.  Positive alpha in recent years (2021-2024) indicates outperformance of the market. However, the negative alpha in earlier periods and the projected large negative alpha in 2023-2025 suggest caution.  The high beta values consistently demonstrate FSLR's strong sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $159.76
* **5-day MA:** $160.64
* **20-day MA:** $167.56
* **60-day MA:** $182.94

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.41 (slightly below neutral; suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.14 (negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -4.9% (short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 282.9% (This extremely high expected return needs further investigation and justification.  The methodology for calculating this figure is not provided and warrants scrutiny.)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the negative relative divergence, suggest a bearish short-term outlook. However, the high expected return needs careful consideration given the lack of transparency regarding its calculation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-29 | 2.92   | $0.89 B     |
| 2024-07-30 | 3.26   | $1.01 B     |
| 2024-05-01 | 2.21   | $0.79 B     |
| 2023-10-31 | 2.51   | $0.80 B     |
| 2024-10-29 | 2.51   | $0.80 B     | *(Possible duplicate entry)*


Revenue shows some growth, but EPS fluctuates.  There appears to be a data duplication on October 29th, 2024.  Further clarification on the data is needed for a thorough analysis.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of key financial data such as total revenue and gross profit prevents a comprehensive financial health assessment. This is a major limitation in the analysis.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR exhibits strong long-term growth potential based on its historical outperformance of the S&P 500 and positive alpha in recent years. However, short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The high volatility and dependence on market conditions (high beta) highlight significant risk.  The missing financial information and the exceptionally high projected return significantly limit the robustness of this analysis.  Further investigation into the expected return calculation, clarification of the duplicate earnings data, and acquisition of complete financial statements are necessary for a more reliable conclusion.  The current analysis is incomplete due to data limitations.
