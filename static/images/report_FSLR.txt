## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Report

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

First Solar, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels.  The provided data shows a cumulative return significantly lagging the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons for this underperformance.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **FSLR Cumulative Return:** 41.02%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 82.57%
* **Return Difference:** -41.55% (FSLR underperformed VOO by 41.55 percentage points)
* **Relative Divergence:** 9.0% (This indicates FSLR's performance is in the 9th percentile relative to its historical performance range against VOO. It doesn't imply superiority or inferiority, just its relative position within its historical range of performance versus VOO.)

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (S&P 500).  While periods of significant outperformance (e.g., 2020-2022) exist, there are also periods of substantial underperformance (e.g., 2023-2025 projection). Market cap has generally increased. Beta fluctuates significantly, suggesting varying levels of market sensitivity over time.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $136.44
* **Last Market Price:** $130.54
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $130.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $128.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $140.86

The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend, though the 20-day MA suggests some recent upward momentum.  The recent price jump from the previous close ($126.57 to $130.54) represents a significant (3.14$) increase.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 50.13 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.25 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 694.7% (This represents a significantly high projected return relative to the S&P 500, though high risk is also indicated)

The recent price increase ('change' = 3.14) might be due to positive market sentiment or news impacting the sector (this needs further investigation for clarity).  The high expected return is noteworthy but should be treated cautiously, given its magnitude and the inherent uncertainty of long-term projections.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-04-29 | 1.96 | $0.84B        |

Earnings show some volatility.  While there are periods of strong EPS and revenue growth, there is also some decline, highlighting potential uncertainty in future earnings. Note the duplicate entry for 2025-04-29; this likely needs clarification.

Both revenue and profit margins show some variability.  ROE is generally positive but fluctuates.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of these fluctuations.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

FSLR's performance has been inconsistent relative to the S&P 500. While the company shows periods of strong growth, particularly in earnings and revenue, there's significant volatility present. Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with some suggesting a potential short-term downward trend despite positive momentum in recent days. The projected long-term return is exceptionally high, which needs careful consideration given inherent risk and potential data issues.  More detailed fundamental analysis (including competitive landscape, future growth prospects, and potential risks) is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated data point in the earnings data requires clarification.  Lastly, the significant discrepancy between projected and realized returns in the alpha/beta analysis across periods needs further exploration to understand potential reasons for this large variance.
