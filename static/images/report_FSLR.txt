## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), FSLR has significantly outperformed.  The cumulative return difference between FSLR (196.99%) and VOO (122.19%) as of the last data point is 74.8 percentage points. This represents a 39.8% position within the historical range of their performance difference (max 274.8%, min -57.3%).  The provided alpha values are consistently near zero, suggesting performance largely tracks market movements (Beta varies significantly year to year, implying sensitivity to market fluctuations).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $194.19
* **5-day Moving Average:** $201.82
* **20-day Moving Average:** $192.98
* **60-day Moving Average:** $210.77

The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend, but above the 20-day moving average suggesting some short-term support. The last market price of $194.32 is very close to the closing price and doesn't suggest any dramatic recent price movement (neither a sharp jump nor a drop).


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (53.15):** Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (0.86):** A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -3.2%, indicating recent weakness.

The expected return of 324.4% over the long term (2+ years) significantly outpaces the expected return of the S&P 500.  This should be viewed cautiously, as it's a projection and doesn't guarantee future performance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some volatility in both revenue and EPS:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates across quarters, with a high of $1.01B in Q2 2024 and a low of $0.79B in Q1 2024.  There isn't a clear upward or downward trend readily apparent from this limited data.
* **EPS:** EPS also shows variation, peaking at $3.26 in Q2 2024 and bottoming at $2.21 in Q1 2024.  Again, a clear trend isn't immediately visible from this short dataset.  There's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-29, which needs clarification.

Without comparative data (expectations, previous yearsâ€™ results), a conclusive assessment of beats or misses is impossible.  Further data is needed for a comprehensive analysis.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuation, but profit margins are generally high and relatively stable, ranging from 43.33% to 50.17%. This indicates strong profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been steadily increasing, and ROE fluctuates, but generally remains positive suggesting a decent return on investment.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which is not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the period shown, exhibiting strong profitability. However, the short-term price action shows some weakness.  Recent earnings data show volatility but generally high profit margins.  The long-term expected return is significantly high, but requires caution due to the inherent uncertainty of projections.  Further analysis is needed to assess the impact of recent news, analyst opinions, and a complete picture of earnings performance against expectations.  The provided data offers a limited snapshot.  More comprehensive data (including the missing context for duplicate entries, expectations, and more historical data) will allow for a more in-depth and reliable investment recommendation.
