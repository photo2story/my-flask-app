## First Solar Inc (FSLR) Investment Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

First Solar Inc (FSLR), a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, has shown a cumulative return of 28.57% over the reviewed period, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 76.08%. While exhibiting periods of high growth and strong profitability, recent performance has been weaker, and the stock's current valuation requires careful consideration.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

First Solar's cumulative return of 28.57% lags behind the S&P 500's 76.08% by 47.5 percentage points. This places its relative performance at the 6.6th percentile based on historical data (ranging from a maximum outperformance of 190.3% to a minimum underperformance of -64.4%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals substantial volatility in performance across different periods. While periods of extremely high CAGR (e.g., 199% from 2020-2022) are noted, these are interspersed with periods of negative or low returns. The Beta values fluctuate, indicating varying sensitivity to overall market movements.  The high positive Alpha in the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods suggests potential outperformance during those periods.  However the large negative CAGR and Alpha values in the 2023-2025 period needs to be carefully considered.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 42.0% | 54.8% | 9.0% | 0.1 | 7.2 |

| 2017-2019  | 40.0% | 67.9% | 7.0% | -0.1 | 6.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 68.0% | 71.7% | 38.0% | -0.1 | 10.6 |
| 2019-2021  | 119.0% | 71.7% | 58.0% | 0.1 | 9.3 |

| 2021-2023  | 3.0% | 65.9% | -18.0% | 0.8 | 18.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 2.0% | 82.2% | -18.0% | 0.8 | 18.9 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock price is currently at $124.38,  down $2.44 from the previous close.  This indicates a recent decline. The moving averages suggest a bearish trend:

* **5-day MA:** $126.12
* **20-day MA:** $127.99
* **60-day MA:** $143.95

The price is below all three moving averages, reinforcing the short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 indicates a medium risk level.
* **RSI:** 48.23 is close to the neutral level (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.50 suggests a bullish momentum, however this needs to be combined with other factors.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.9 indicates recent short-term price decline.
* **Expected Return:** 987.1% is a very high expected return and needs additional justification based on a more rigorous forecasting methodology, not just based on the previous CAGR. This figure, on its own, is not a trustworthy indicator.
* **Price Change:** The recent price drop of $1.92 reflects a relatively small percentage change within the larger context of the data.  No significant immediate 'sudden drop' needs specific consideration.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some variability in EPS and revenue. While revenue generally trends upward, EPS fluctuations suggest some inconsistency in profitability.  There's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-29.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons behind the variability to validate and interpret the data appropriately.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

First Solar shows a mixed performance picture.  While it possesses strong fundamentals in a growing industry, its significant underperformance against the S&P 500 and the recent price decline raise concerns.  The high projected return needs further support.  The variability in earnings and profitability requires thorough analysis to understand the underlying drivers.  A deeper dive into the company's strategic initiatives, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is needed before making any investment decisions.  The data provided suggests a need for further investigation rather than a confident investment recommendation at this time.
