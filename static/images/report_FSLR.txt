**6) Overall Analysis:**

First Solar has demonstrated strong long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the period analysed. However,  its performance is volatile, with periods of both substantial gains and losses.  The recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, but the oversold RSI and high projected long-term return might present an opportunity for long-term investors.  However, careful consideration of the significant volatility and potential risks inherent in a high-growth stock like FSLR is crucial. Further investigation into the accuracy of the provided data (especially the duplicate entry in the earnings data) is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.
