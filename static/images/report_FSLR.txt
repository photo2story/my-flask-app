## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of solar panels.  The cumulative return of FSLR is 207.34%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%. The difference in cumulative returns is 78.5%, placing it in the 39.8th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided maximum and minimum historical differences).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  Alpha generally indicates outperformance relative to the benchmark (positive values), while beta measures volatility relative to the market.  While the alpha values suggest periods of significant outperformance, the beta values indicate high volatility, which is typical for growth stocks in the renewable energy sector.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $192.57 (Last Market: $192.68)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $189.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $193.48
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $212.51

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the 5-day moving average suggests recent price stability.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (46.7):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory but not yet definitively so.
* **PPO (0.56):** Suggests a potential bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-4.7):** Shows a recent slight decline in relative strength.

Given the price of $192.68 is close to the recent 20 day moving average, and not significantly above or below, there's no immediate indication of a sharp rebound or decline.  The expected return of 333.7% over a long-term (2+ years) horizon represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500,  but this is a projection and not a guarantee.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data shows fluctuating revenue and EPS.  While there was a slight dip in revenue in Q3 2024 compared to Q2 2024, overall revenue has shown growth year-on-year. Profit margins have fluctuated around 50%, indicating the company's profitability varies by quarter.  Missing information on the expected EPS for the latest quarter makes a full analysis difficult.

**6. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some seasonality, with higher revenue in Q2 and Q4. Profit margins are generally strong, hovering around 45-50%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** ROE fluctuates, suggesting some variability in profitability. Equity has been consistently increasing, reflecting company growth.

The consistent increase in equity shows healthy financial standing, but profitability could be analyzed further with the addition of missing information.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

**8. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR shows strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, it is a volatile stock, as indicated by the high beta values and the recent price movement below moving averages. While recent financial performance shows fluctuations, the company demonstrates strong profitability.  A thorough analysis needs to incorporate recent news and the complete Q3 2024 EPS to gain a comprehensive perspective. The high projected long-term return is promising but needs caution. Investors should carefully consider the inherent volatility and thoroughly research any recent news before making investment decisions.
