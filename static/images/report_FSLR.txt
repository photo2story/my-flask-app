## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Review

This report analyzes First Solar Inc. (FSLR), a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, based on the provided data.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

FSLR's cumulative return (13.10%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 71.02%. The difference is -57.9%, placing it at the 11.2th percentile of its historical range (-85.1% to 158.4%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance against the market.  While periods of strong outperformance (e.g., 2020-2022 with a 176% CAGR) exist, others show significant underperformance (e.g., 2023-2025 with a -184% CAGR).  The high beta values (frequently above 4.5) indicate significant volatility and sensitivity to overall market movements.  Alpha is generally low, suggesting limited ability to consistently outperform the market, though there were periods of positive alpha. Market capitalization fluctuates significantly over the years.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2016-2018  | -36.0% | 64.5% | -53.0% | -0.0 | 4.5 |
| 2017-2019  | 40.0% | 64.5% | 11.0% | 0.3 | 6.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 63.0% | 64.5% | 34.0% | -0.0 | 10.6 |
| 2019-2021  | 97.0% | 62.3% | 23.0% | 0.1 | 9.3 |
| 2020-2022  | 176.0% | 65.0% | 155.0% | 0.0 | 16.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -12.0% | 65.0% | -40.0% | 1.0 | 18.4 |
| 2022-2024  | -11.0% | 82.2% | -26.0% | 1.0 | 18.9 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $128.69
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $129.75
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $130.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.17

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price change (-5.53) indicates a significant drop from the previous close. This signals a possible continuation of the downtrend, or a potential short-term reversal if the RSI/PPO indicators suggest oversold conditions.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.69 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 1.035 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +7.8% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 335.9% (Long-term potential, but highly dependent on market conditions and FSLR's ability to execute its strategy)

The significant recent price drop (-5.53) could be interpreted as a sharp decline. Given the high MRI and the price below moving averages, caution is warranted. The positive PPO and improving relative strength suggest potential for a short-term rebound, but the long-term outlook is uncertain given the significant price volatility and negative CAGR over recent periods.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

FSLR's performance has been highly volatile, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 in the long term despite periods of strong growth. High beta suggests significant market sensitivity. Recent price action shows a downtrend, with the price below key moving averages.  While some technical indicators (PPO) hint at potential upward momentum, the high market risk indicator and significant recent price drop warrant caution.  Strong profit margins are a positive indicator, but inconsistent revenue and EPS require further investigation.  The projected long-term return (335.9%) is very optimistic and dependent on numerous factors.  A more thorough analysis using complete and verified data, along with a deeper dive into company-specific factors and industry trends, is necessary for a conclusive assessment.  The high risk associated with FSLR requires investors to carefully consider their risk tolerance.
