## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes First Solar Inc. (FSLR), a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

First Solar's cumulative return (196.95%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (127.58%) by 69.37%.  This places FSLR in the 37.14th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided range of maximum and minimum outperformance.  While the outperformance is substantial, the relative percentile indicates periods of underperformance compared to the S&P 500 have also occurred.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $186.05 (Last Market: $186.08)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $187.15
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $194.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $213.81

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates the recent decline is not extremely sharp.

**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (34.25):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound. However, it's crucial to consider this in conjunction with other indicators.
* **PPO (-0.1):**  A negative PPO value signals bearish momentum.  The negative value further supports the downward trend suggested by the moving averages.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-7.89):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (23.95%):**  Suggests a potential significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if the stock follows its projected trajectory. This should be interpreted cautiously and is not a guaranteed outcome.  The recent price decline is not reflected in this long-term forecast.

**4. Recent Financials & Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows some volatility in both revenue and EPS. While revenue fluctuates, the profit margin remains relatively strong, ranging from 43.57% to 50.17%.  More comprehensive data and analysis would be needed to make definitive conclusions.   The most recent EPS (2.92) is slightly lower than the previous quarter (3.26), suggesting potential growth challenges.  Missing is a comparison to analyst expectations for the 2024-10-29 earnings report. A comparison to the expected EPS would provide more clarity regarding the recent results.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally demonstrates a strong and growing trend.  Profit margins are healthy and mostly above 40%, indicating good profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity shows steady growth. Return on Equity (ROE) is reasonably consistent and displays periods of higher profitability.  However, the ROE needs more context to assess if the current rates are satisfactory, given industry averages and competitor performance.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Data:** The request for news within the last two days, including earnings news from sources like shacknews and analyst opinions from FINBOLD, requires accessing external resources.  This analysis cannot provide that specific information.  To obtain this information, please consult these sources directly.


**8. Summary:**

First Solar exhibits substantial long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500, shown by the high cumulative return.  However, recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, supported by moving averages and a negative PPO.  The RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, indicating a possible price rebound.  Healthy profit margins and increasing equity indicate a fundamentally strong company. However, a more thorough review of recent earnings compared to analyst expectations and a broader market outlook are essential for comprehensive evaluation. The long-term expected return is promising, but the current downward trend introduces a degree of uncertainty. The next steps should include reviewing the specific earnings report, analyst reports from the cited sources, and comparing FSLR's performance against its competitors.
