*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, indicating volatility in returns.  The recent period (2023-2025) shows a very negative CAGR.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values across all periods suggest substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:** Varies greatly.  Recent periods show negative alpha, indicating underperformance relative to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Generally low, even negative in earlier periods, but increasing to 0.7 and then 1.0 in the most recent periods. This suggests a changing correlation with the market and potentially increased sensitivity to market movements.
*   **Cap:** Market Cap generally increased from 2015 to 2025

*   **60-day MA:** 181.92

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but significantly above the 60-day moving average. This suggests a potential short-term downtrend or consolidation after a longer-term uptrend. The slight price decrease from the previous close indicates minor selling pressure.

*   **Expected Return:** 2401.2% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**
