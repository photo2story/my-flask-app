**8. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests a downward trend, supported by technical indicators (PPO and moving averages).  While the RSI hints at potential oversold conditions, the negative 20-day divergence warrants caution.  Financials show generally positive revenue and profitability, though with some seasonality.  A deeper dive into recent earnings reports and analyst forecasts, along with the broader market outlook, is crucial for determining the current investment attractiveness of FSLR.  Long-term prospects appear positive given the expected return, but short-term volatility should be considered.
