## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Report

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

FSLR (First Solar Inc.) is a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels.  The company shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with a substantially higher cumulative return.  However, the relative strength indicator (RSI) suggests the stock might be oversold, and other indicators warrant further investigation.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **FSLR Cumulative Return:** 154.86%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 119.91%
* **Return Difference:** 34.95% (FSLR outperformed VOO by 34.95% at the last data point).
* **Relative Strength:**  The relative strength of 27.8% indicates FSLR's performance is above the 27.8th percentile compared to its historical performance relative to the VOO, given the specified range.  This is a moderately positive signal but does not indicate consistently superior performance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta values show inconsistent outperformance against the market (as measured by Alpha).  High Beta values (above 1) suggest higher volatility compared to the market.  The substantial variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) highlights the cyclical nature of the solar energy sector and FSLR's vulnerability to market shifts.  Note that a negative CAGR indicates a loss over that period.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 48.0% | 21.3% | 20.0% | 7.2   |
| 2016-2018  | -47.0% | 21.3% | -65.0% | -0.2  |
| 2017-2019  | 49.0% | 21.3% | 19.0% | -0.6  |
| 2018-2020  | 51.0% | 20.7% | 24.0% | -0.1  |
| 2019-2021  | 57.0% | 19.9% | -14.0% | 0.0   |
| 2020-2022  | 165.0% | 19.9% | 156.0% | 0.0   |
| 2021-2023  | 85.0% | 17.7% | 62.0% | 1.2   |
| 2022-2024  | 123.0% | 21.9% | 91.0% | 1.1   |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $167.52
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $165.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $180.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $188.30

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change is small (+$0.0776).  This lack of significant movement is noteworthy given the broader recent performance trends.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 31.67 (Suggests the stock may be oversold; below 30 typically indicates oversold conditions)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.89 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +0.4 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 216.8% (Significantly higher than the market; however, this prediction requires careful consideration given the high volatility shown in the CAGR data).

The contradictory signals from RSI and PPO highlight the uncertainty surrounding FSLR's near-term direction.  The high expected return suggests a longer-term bullish outlook, but this forecast needs to be viewed cautiously due to the historical volatility of the stock.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-29 | 2.92 | $0.89B      |
| 2024-07-30 | 3.26 | $1.01B      |
| 2024-05-01 | 2.21 | $0.79B      |
| 2023-10-31 | 2.51 | $0.80B      |
| 2024-10-29 | 2.51 | $0.80B      |

There's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-29.  Assuming the second entry is an error, recent earnings show some fluctuation. Revenue is relatively stable, but EPS shows variation, suggesting potential factors affecting profitability.  More detailed analysis is needed to understand the drivers behind these fluctuations.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.89B | 50.17%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.01B | 49.37%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.79B | 43.57%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $1.16B | 43.33%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.80B | 46.96%       |

Profit margins are generally high but have fluctuated recently.  Revenue is also inconsistent, reflecting the cyclical nature of the solar industry.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $7.59B | 4.12% |
| 2024-06-30 | $7.26B | 4.82% |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.90B | 3.43% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.69B | 5.22% |
| 2023-09-30 | $6.30B | 4.26% |

Equity has been steadily increasing, and ROE (Return on Equity) shows some variation.  Both indicate the financial health of the company, but require further analysis alongside revenue and profit margins.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

FSLR shows strong long-term growth potential compared to the S&P 500, reflected in the high cumulative return. However, the stock exhibits considerable volatility, as evidenced by the fluctuating CAGR, Beta values, and recent price movements.  While the current price might appear undervalued based on the RSI and high expected return, the conflicting signals from various technical indicators and the cyclical nature of the solar industry demand caution.  Thorough fundamental analysis, considering factors beyond the provided data, is essential before making any investment decisions.  The high expected return should be treated as a speculative long-term projection, not a guaranteed outcome.
