**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $184.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $191.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $195.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $204.85

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (43.43):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory (below 50), but not yet significantly so.  Further decline is possible.
* **PPO (-0.4987):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-5.3%):** Shows a recent weakening in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (340.1%):** This exceptionally high expected return needs further context.  It's likely based on a long-term projection and is highly dependent on several factors, which should be independently verified.  A 340.1% return over a period of two years or more against the S&P 500 is extremely optimistic and highly unlikely.

The current price of $184.27, being below the moving averages, suggests that there has not been a recent price surge (neither a sharp upturn nor a sharp downturn).

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the longer term, but recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn.  Technical indicators show a bearish signal. Financial data reveals high profit margins but inconsistent revenue and EPS trends.  The extremely high projected return should be treated with skepticism.

Further analysis requires additional data points and context, specifically regarding the methodology behind the high projected return. The high beta also indicates a riskier investment than the broader market.
