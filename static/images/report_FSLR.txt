**6. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR's performance has been volatile, with periods of significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While the recent price action shows a bearish trend, indicated by its position below moving averages and oversold RSI, the long-term expected return is surprisingly high.  However, caution is advised due to the inherent volatility highlighted by the high beta values and the significant price drop in the recent past. A thorough investigation into the reasons for the recent price decline is necessary.  Furthermore, the high projected long-term return should be treated with skepticism and further analysis is required to assess its validity.  Thorough fundamental analysis is needed to properly assess the investment opportunity considering its risk-reward profile.  The company's financials show strong profitability, but revenue is inconsistent.  Additional information, such as news and industry trends, is needed to complete a comprehensive analysis.
