*   **CAGR:**  Shows strong variability in annual growth, ranging from negative to very positive.  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a significant decline.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently very high near 100%, indicating substantial peak-to-trough declines in these periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is inconsistent.  Positive Alpha indicates outperformance relative to the market risk-adjusted return; negative Alpha indicates underperformance. The large negative Alpha in 2023-2025 is concerning.
*   **Beta:**  Beta is generally around 1.0 or slightly above, suggesting FSLR's price moves roughly in line with the market (S&P 500) but with slightly more volatility.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 261.23
*   **Previous Close:** 264.3
*   **Change:** -1.16
*   **5-day SMA:** 267.14
*   **20-day SMA:** 262.85
*   **60-day SMA:** 253.74

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price closed slightly lower than the previous day.

This *could* suggest a short-term upward trend, but the current closing price is below both the 5-day and 20-day SMA, indicating potential recent weakness. The decline on the most recent day should be considered a potential warning sign.

*   **RSI:** 49.48 (Neutral - Neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.21 (Slightly Bearish - suggests the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average)

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.4 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0% (No expected excess return compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium to high investment recommendation, but this should be tempered by other indicators.
*   The RSI is neutral, offering no strong buy or sell signal.
*   The slightly negative PPO suggests a potential weakening trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, aligning with the MRI, but the expected return is 0%, meaning this is not projected to outperform the market.
*   The negative divergence change over the past 20 days confirms a recent downward trend.

*   **Negatives/Concerns:**
