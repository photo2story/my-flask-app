**Analysis:**

*   **Underperformance:** FSLR has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the tracked period.
*   **Alpha and Beta:**  The Alpha and Beta values are volatile, indicating that FSLR's performance is not consistently tied to the market's overall performance. The recent negative alpha and high beta (in 2023-2025) suggest that FSLR has significantly underperformed the market and is more sensitive to market movements, possibly due to sector-specific headwinds.
*   **CAGR & MDD:**  The table shows high volatility. There are periods of strong positive returns (e.g., 2020-2022), but also periods of significant losses (e.g., 2016-2018, 2023-2025). Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant risk.

Investors might consider starting with a smaller allocation and adding over time, especially if the stock price dips.
