## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Investment Review

This report analyzes First Solar Inc. (FSLR), a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

FSLR's cumulative return (229.38%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (129.75%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 99.6%, placing it in the 46th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (max: 283.7%, min: -57.3%).  This indicates strong relative performance, though the relative outperformance is not at its highest historical level. Alpha values consistently near zero suggest performance largely tracks the market (Beta values vary significantly across years, reflecting market sensitivity changes).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $207.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $199.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $193.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $212.28

The price is slightly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend, although the 5 and 20-day averages indicate a recent upward trend.  The last market price of $201.71 reflects a recent pullback from the closing price.  This does not constitute a significant drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 69.75 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.55 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** NaN (-) suggesting a recent short-term downward trend.

The relatively high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought in the short term. However, the positive PPO indicates continued bullish momentum. The NaN value for the relative divergence needs further clarification.  The projected 288.5% return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's historical average. This high expected return, however, needs to be viewed cautiously considering the inherent volatility and uncertainty in long-term market projections.  Two years is not a particularly long investment horizon for a long-term strategy.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates between $0.79B and $1.01B across the reported quarters, without a clear consistent upward trend.
* **EPS:** EPS also fluctuates, reaching a high of $3.26 in Q2 2024 and a low of $2.21 in Q1 2024.  There's no consistent increasing or decreasing trend to be clearly identified.
* **Comparison:** A direct comparison to previous quarters (excluding those not provided) and expectations requires additional data not available in the provided information.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows fluctuation. Profit margins are generally high (40-50%), showing some variability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is increasing, indicating growth. ROE fluctuates, suggesting variability in profitability.  Additional context, such as comparison to industry benchmarks, would be needed for a comprehensive assessment.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Further information is required to assess recent market outlook and analyst sentiment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has demonstrated strong performance relative to the S&P 500 over the longer term. However, short-term indicators suggest potential overbought conditions and recent price fluctuations.  The company shows strong profit margins, but revenue and EPS show volatility.  More data is needed regarding specific financial expectations, recent news, and analyst opinions for a complete evaluation.  The significantly high projected return should be treated with caution. A thorough fundamental and technical analysis, along with consideration of external factors and risk tolerance, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
