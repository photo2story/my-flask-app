**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of solar energy systems.  Over the observed period, FSLR significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return of 41.02% compared to VOO's 82.57%.  This represents a substantial difference of -41.55%. While the relative divergence rank of 9% suggests this underperformance is not entirely unprecedented, it highlights a need for further investigation into the factors driving this disparity.

The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta data shows significant volatility in FSLR's performance relative to the market (Beta).  High CAGR years are interspersed with years of negative returns and high maximum drawdown (MDD).  The high Beta values suggest a significant sensitivity to market fluctuations.  While recent Alpha values are positive, they were negative in prior periods, demonstrating inconsistency in outperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $136.44
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $130.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $128.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $140.86

The recent price of $136.44 represents a significant jump ($4.07) from the previous close.  This price is above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend but a longer-term trajectory that may need further consideration. The increase is noteworthy but needs to be considered in the context of the company's overall performance and market conditions.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk) indicates moderate market volatility.
* **RSI:** 50.13, near the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 1.25, a positive value, generally suggesting a bullish trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.4, indicating a short-term upward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** 694.7% represents a very high projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment. This requires careful scrutiny, given the historical volatility. The significant recent price increase (+$4.07) may be a factor contributing to this expectation, but the sustainability of such a high return is questionable.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR's performance has been volatile, with periods of significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While recent earnings suggest growth and high profit margins, the large swings in performance and the high Beta highlight significant market risk. The projected long-term return needs further justification, given the historical volatility and the potential need for clarification on some data points (duplicate earnings entry).  A more in-depth analysis, considering macroeconomic factors, industry trends, and a deeper dive into the company's competitive landscape and future projections would be required to assess the true investment potential.  The currently available data paints a picture of a high-growth, high-risk investment with inconsistent performance relative to the market benchmark.
