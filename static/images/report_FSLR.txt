* **5-day Moving Average:** $187.72
* **20-day Moving Average:** $194.65
* **60-day Moving Average:** $203.75

The stock is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (31.97):** Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce back, although it's near critical levels that could result in a continued downward trend.
* **PPO (-0.94):** Shows a bearish trend.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (-7.4%):** Suggests a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (378.9%):**  This high projected return, if accurate, suggests significant outperformance over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500, potentially reflecting the company's growth potential in the renewable energy sector. However, this extremely high figure requires further investigation to assess validity.  The current price of $175.88 is below the recent moving averages which doesn't align with a significantly upward-bound expected return.  This may be impacted by the market's expectation of significant future growth potential that isn't yet reflected in the current market price.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data reveals some volatility in both EPS and revenue:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates significantly quarter to quarter, indicating a lack of consistent revenue growth.  While revenue hit $1.01 Billion in Q2 2024, it fell to $0.89 Billion in Q3 2024.
* **EPS:** Similarly fluctuates.  The highest EPS was in Q2 2024 ($3.26), while Q3 2024 saw a drop to $2.92. This trend is inconsistent, requiring more analysis to understand the underlying cause for the volatility.
* **Significant Changes:** The data doesn't provide sufficient information to identify any clear beats or misses against expectations.  Further research into analyst forecasts is needed.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows variability across the quarters. Profit margins have generally remained strong but dropped slightly in Q3 2024, despite the 40%+ margin being reasonably robust.

* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has been steadily increasing. ROE shows some fluctuation;  it peaked in Q4 2023 and fluctuates around the 4% mark, revealing some inconsistency in profitability.  Further analysis is needed to identify causes for this fluctuation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR shows significant potential in a growing market, evidenced by its high long-term expected return.  However, considerable volatility is apparent in its performance, both historically and in recent quarterly earnings.  Current price action suggests a bearish short-term outlook, with the price trading below its moving averages.  While the long-term outlook might be positive given the renewable energy sector's growth, the company's performance is inherently volatile, and the incredibly high expected return requires more detailed verification.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with this stock before investing.  Further research into recent news, analyst reports, and the reasons for the volatility in revenue and EPS is essential before making any investment decisions.  Additional market analysis is necessary to determine how the renewable energy sector, and First Solar’s position in it, is assessed by the market.
