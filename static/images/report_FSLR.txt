## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of solar panels.  Over the analyzed period, FSLR accumulated a return of 212.11%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 124.78%.  The difference is 87.33%, placing its relative outperformance at the 42.41 percentile of its historical range (max: 283.74%, min: -57.29%).  This indicates strong historical outperformance compared to the broader market, though not consistently at the extreme high end.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market. While some periods show significant alpha (outperformance), others show negative alpha and high beta (higher volatility than the market).  This highlights the inherent risk associated with FSLR's stock.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $195.56 (Last Market: $189.29)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $189.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $197.11
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $216.81

The stock price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day average indicates a more substantial pullback. The last market price of $189.29, lower than the closing price, suggests a slight recovery or a potential rebound.


**3. Technical Indicators and Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 47.68 – This indicates the stock is nearing neutral territory; neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.13 – A positive value suggests a bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.05 – This negative value indicates a recent decrease in the stock's relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 18.69% – This represents the projected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy.

The combination of indicators suggests a somewhat neutral to slightly bullish outlook, but the recent negative relative divergence warrants caution.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows some volatility in quarterly EPS and revenue. While revenue consistently exceeds $0.79B, EPS fluctuates.  The most recent EPS of 2.92 (October 29, 2024) slightly underperformed the previous quarter.  Further analysis of these figures, including comparison to analyst estimates for the most recent quarter, is needed to draw definitive conclusions about the company's performance and outlook.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some seasonality, with higher numbers in Q2 and Q4.  Profit margins are generally strong, fluctuating between 43% and 50%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been steadily increasing, with ROE fluctuating, but generally staying around 4%.  These figures suggest a healthy financial position. Further analysis is needed to assess the sustainability and trends.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has shown significant historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a more cautious stance in the short term.  The long-term outlook, based on the provided expected return, remains positive, conditional on maintaining robust financial performance and favorable industry trends.  A thorough review of the recent news, including earnings reports and analyst opinions, is crucial for refining the short-term and long-term assessments.  The inconsistency in alpha and high beta should be considered; this stock carries higher risk than the market as a whole.


**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the data, a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy with a focus on dollar-cost averaging would mitigate some of the short-term risk.  However, careful monitoring of the stock price, financial performance, and industry news is essential for informed investment decisions.  The relatively neutral RSI and positive, though weak, PPO suggest a potential for recovery, but the recent negative relative divergence and the price's position below key moving averages indicate short-term weakness.
