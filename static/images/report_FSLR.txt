**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has demonstrated strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. However, it exhibits high volatility (high beta), and recent price action suggests a short-term downward trend. The financial data indicates generally strong profitability, with some quarter-to-quarter variations.  The high long-term expected return warrants consideration, but the inherent risk associated with the stock's volatility should be carefully evaluated.  Further investigation is needed to resolve the inconsistencies in the provided earnings data.  A thorough assessment of the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions.
