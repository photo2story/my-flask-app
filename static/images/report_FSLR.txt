## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Investment Report

This report analyzes First Solar Inc. (FSLR), a leading provider of thin-film solar modules and solar energy systems, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

FSLR's cumulative return of 207.41% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return of 122.07% over the analyzed period.  The difference is 85.3 percentage points, placing it in the 42.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a range of -57.3% to 274.8%).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $201.0
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $199.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $194.68
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $209.14

The price is currently below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend, although it's above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages.  The relatively close proximity of the 5 and 20-day moving averages to the current price indicates low volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (64.9):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (0.76):** A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-0.3):** Shows a slight weakening in relative strength recently.
* **Expected Return (300%):**  A 300% expected return over two years or more is significantly higher than typical market returns. This should be viewed with caution as it's a forecast, not a guaranteed outcome.  The high expected return suggests substantial upside potential compared to the S&P 500, although high expectations typically come with higher risk.  The relatively high delta_previous_relative_divergence (assuming a typo and it's supposed to be relative strength) suggests the recent price decline may have been faster than the underlying momentum.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some variability in both revenue and EPS:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates, with a high of $1.01B in Q2 2024 and a low of $0.79B in Q1 2024.  There's no clear consistent upward or downward trend.
* **EPS:**  Similar to revenue, EPS also shows fluctuation.  Q2 2024 shows the highest EPS at $3.26, while Q1 2024 shows the lowest at $2.21.  There's no clear upward or downward trend in EPS.

**Without access to earnings expectations**, it's impossible to determine whether these results beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue is somewhat inconsistent quarter-to-quarter. Profit margins have fluctuated between 43% and 50%, suggesting strong profitability but without a clear upward trend.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been steadily increasing. ROE has fluctuated but generally remained above 4%.

The financial data reveals a company with generally strong profitability and increasing equity, although both revenue and profitability exhibit quarter-to-quarter variability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **No recent earnings news (within the last 2 days) is provided.**
* **Recent Market Outlook, Analyst Opinions, and Performance Highlights are not provided.** This information is crucial for a comprehensive analysis and should be sourced independently.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

FSLR has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, exhibiting strong cumulative returns. However, recent price action suggests some short-term weakness.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture.  While the company displays strong profitability and growing equity, revenue and EPS exhibit variability. The projected 300% return over the long term is extremely ambitious and needs validation through further market analysis, including analyst opinions and sector outlook, not provided here.  The absence of recent news and analyst opinions limits the depth of this analysis.  Further investigation is recommended before making any investment decisions.
