## First Solar Inc (FSLR) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:**

First Solar, Inc. (FSLR) is a leading manufacturer of solar panels.  While its cumulative return (37.99%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) return (87.98%),  analysis suggests potential for long-term growth. However, recent performance shows high volatility and considerable risk.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

First Solar's cumulative return of 37.99% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's 87.98% return. The current relative divergence of -50.0 indicates FSLR is performing substantially below the S&P 500 within the historical range of its relative performance.


The alpha and beta analysis reveals significant volatility in performance over the years.  While periods of high positive alpha and strong CAGR exist (e.g., 2020-2022), there are also periods of substantial negative returns and high maximum drawdown (MDD). Beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.  The consistently high MDD values across several periods highlight the high risk associated with investing in FSLR.

The recent price action shows a significant jump. The closing price is 133.76,  while the last market price is 140.68 (a 5.17 increase). This indicates a rapid upward movement.  Moving averages suggest a potential upward trend, but also highlight the recent price surge is above recent averages:

* **Closing Price:** 133.76
* **Last Market Price:** 140.68
* **5-day MA:** 129.6
* **20-day MA:** 130.21

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** 0.15, a positive value indicating a bullish trend.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.1, indicating a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 1139.0%  This exceptionally high figure needs further justification and context.  Such a high expected return is highly improbable and likely reflects an unrealistic projection.  A more realistic long-term outlook is needed.  The price jump should be considered when assessing this figure.  The significant recent price increase ('Last-Market' data) needs to be incorporated into a revised risk assessment.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6) Overall Analysis:**

FSLR shows potential for growth in the long term, supported by its position in the renewable energy sector. However, its high volatility, as evidenced by significant MDD and fluctuating alpha and beta values, presents considerable risk.  The recent surge in price requires careful consideration and warrants further investigation into potential drivers of this sudden increase. The exceptionally high expected return of 1139% needs substantial revision and contextualization to be credible.  A more conservative and realistic expectation should be formulated based on thorough fundamental and technical analysis, taking into account the observed volatility and the recent price increase. Before making any investment decisions, a detailed risk assessment and comparison to similar companies within the solar energy sector is crucial.
