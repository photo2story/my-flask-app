## First Solar Inc. (FSLR) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures:**

* **Cumulative Return (FSLR):** 32.28%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 76.18%
* **Return Difference (FSLR vs VOO):** -43.9%
* **Relative Divergence:** 8.0% (Indicates FSLR performed relatively lower than VOO, but not significantly below its historical range of underperformance relative to VOO)
* **Current Price:** $127.98

**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

First Solar Inc. is a leading manufacturer of thin-film solar panels.  Over the analyzed period, FSLR significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return substantially lower than VOO's.  While the relative divergence suggests this underperformance is within its historical range, it's crucial to analyze the underlying factors.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance with fluctuating alpha and beta values.  High CAGR values are counterbalanced by substantial maximum drawdown (MDD) figures in some periods.  This signifies periods of high volatility and risk, despite periods of strong growth. The high beta suggests high correlation and sensitivity to market movements. The recent years' alpha values indicate outperformance (0.8), but a significant negative CAGR in the 2023-2025 period reveals a considerable drop in performance and potential issues to review.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $127.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $127.96
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $143.22

The price is currently very close to its 20-day moving average, suggesting a period of consolidation. However, it's significantly below its 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $2.89 compared to the previous close indicates a minor positive movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 50.50 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.59 (Positive; suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +3.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 796.6%  This exceptionally high figure requires further investigation and careful consideration of the associated risks.  It represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but such high returns are highly unlikely and necessitate a critical review of the methodology used to arrive at this projection.

The recent price increase of $2.89 doesnâ€™t represent a significant sharp move.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue    |

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|

**6. Overall Analysis:**

First Solar's performance is marked by periods of strong growth and significant drawdowns, leading to high volatility. While recent earnings show profitability, revenue and profit margins fluctuate considerably.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return requires further scrutiny and should be viewed with skepticism.  The company's sensitivity to market movements (high beta) makes it a riskier investment.  Before making any investment decisions,  a thorough examination of the underlying causes of revenue and profit margin fluctuations, along with a detailed analysis of the projected 796.6% expected return, is crucial. The data suggests the need for careful risk management when considering investing in FSLR.  Independent verification of data, particularly the duplicate entry in recent earnings, is also essential.
