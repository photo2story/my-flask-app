2025-01-30 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Chevron Corp (CVX) based on the provided data, formatted as a report.

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO)**

Chevron Corp (CVX) is an American multinational energy corporation engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, and refining.

The cumulative return of CVX is 71.08%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 119.94%.  The difference is -48.9%, placing it at the 20.9th percentile of the historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided minimum and maximum deviations). This indicates that while CVX has shown positive growth, it has underperformed the broader market significantly over the observed period.


**2. Recent Price Movement**

As of the last reported data point:

* **Closing Price:** $155.69
* **5-day Moving Average:** $156.16
* **20-day Moving Average:** $153.48
* **60-day Moving Average:** $154.23

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent minor downward pressure. However, it sits above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend over the medium to longer term.  The recent price change (-$0.33) indicates a minor daily decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 64.65.  This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, falling within the neutral range.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.14. A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +0.6. This shows a recent increase in relative strength.

* **Expected Return:** 14.6%. This indicates a projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance of the S&P 500, assuming continued consistent investment.  However, the reliability of this projection needs to be assessed given the significantly lower historical performance against the VOO.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis**

The provided earnings data shows some variability in both EPS and revenue.  Note there is a duplicate entry for 2024-11-07.  We will proceed with the assumption that the second entry is an error.


| Date       | EPS    | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 2.49   | 48.93         |
| 2024-08-07 | 2.43   | 49.57         |
| 2024-05-02 | 2.99   | 46.58         |
| 2023-11-02 | 3.48   | 51.92         |


There's a noticeable decline in EPS from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024, followed by a slight increase in Q2 2024. Revenue has also fluctuated, with a recent decrease in Q3 2024. Further analysis is needed to determine underlying trends and factors driving these fluctuations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has been relatively stable, with some fluctuations. Profit margins are generally high and consistent, though they show some variation across the quarters.


**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally increased over the period shown. ROE (Return on Equity) shows some volatility, but remains generally positive.


**6. Alpha and Beta Analysis**

The provided alpha values of consistently zero across all periods suggest the performance of CVX has closely tracked the market performance with little individual stock alpha. The beta values are not present, and are needed to understand the volatility of CVX relative to the market.   High beta suggests it's riskier, while a beta of 1 suggests similar volatility to the market.


**7. Overall Analysis**

CVX has shown considerable historical growth, though significantly underperforming the S&P 500 in the provided timeframe. Recent price action is somewhat mixed, with indicators suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. While the projected long-term expected return is positive compared to the S&P 500, this projection must be viewed with caution given the historical underperformance. Earnings and financial data show some volatility but generally positive results.  A comprehensive evaluation requires further detailed analysis of its operational performance, future projections (including those related to oil and gas price fluctuations), and a complete understanding of the beta.  The consistently zero alpha suggests CVX primarily moves with the market.  Further investigation into the discrepancies between the expected return and historical performance is needed.



**8. Conclusion**

Based on the limited data, CVX presents a mixed picture.  While showing positive returns and generally healthy financial metrics, its significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 warrants careful consideration.  Investors should conduct a thorough due diligence process before making investment decisions, considering the risks associated with the energy sector and the volatility in oil and gas prices.  Additional information, particularly concerning the beta and a deeper understanding of the reasons for underperformance are needed to create a complete picture of this investment.
