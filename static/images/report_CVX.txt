*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly year to year, showing cyclical performance.  Recent years (2022-2025) show negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High drawdowns consistently exceeding 65% indicate high volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is inconsistent.  Periods of positive alpha (outperformance relative to its risk) are offset by periods of negative alpha (underperformance). The 2023-2025 period is particularly concerning with a -113.0% alpha.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values consistently below 1 indicate that CVX is theoretically less volatile than the market.  However, the MDD figures suggest otherwise.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated, showing growth followed by recent stabilization.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 147.69
*   **Last Market Change:** -1.22 (Price decrease)
*   **5-day SMA:** 148.75
*   **20-day SMA:** 149.82
*   **60-day SMA:** 152.85

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The negative change from the previous close reinforces this observation.

**3. Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 41.21 (Approaching oversold, but not there yet)
*   **PPO:** -0.0691 (Slightly bearish, indicating price decline)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (8 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)" - Conflicting with overall bearish signals.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Negative, indicating a short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** 851.8% (High, but needs to be viewed with caution given the other negative indicators)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is nearing oversold territory which could signal a potential bounce, but overall the indicators point towards short-term bearishness. The Hybrid signal is contradictory, suggesting a buying opportunity despite the risks. The extremely high expected return should be treated with skepticism, especially considering the negative divergence and other concerning factors.

The data presents a cautious outlook for Chevron. While analysts are optimistic, the recent performance, decreasing revenue and EPS, geopolitical risks, and conflicting technical indicators suggest potential downside. The "Why Isn't Chevron Stock Moving?" headline reflects concerns about the stock's stagnation. A closer look at Chevron's long-term strategy, its response to geopolitical risks, and the reasons behind the increasing profit margins and decreasing ROE is needed before making an investment decision.
