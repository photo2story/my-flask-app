**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $155.24
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $159.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $159.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $151.56

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a potential bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (37.98):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.58):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-6.8%):** Shows a recent decline in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return is 0%, meaning no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is predicted over the long term (2+ years).  Given the current underperformance and negative technical indicators, this prediction needs careful consideration.  The closing price of $155.25 is close to the 20 and 60-day averages, a possible indication of support, but without any substantial upward price movements to suggest immediate recovery.
