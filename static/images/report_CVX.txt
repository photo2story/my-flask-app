**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출          |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 2.49    | $48.93 B      |
| 2024-08-07 | 2.43    | $49.57 B      |

| 2024-11-07 | 3.48    | $51.92 B      |


There's a discrepancy in the data, with duplicate entries for November 2024.  Assuming the first November entry is correct, earnings show some volatility, with EPS declining in recent quarters. Revenue has remained relatively stable, but profit margins may be shrinking. Further investigation into this data is needed to draw robust conclusions.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

CVX has shown mixed performance compared to the S&P 500, with periods of both outperformance and underperformance.  Recent price movements suggest a short-term uptrend, but technical indicators like RSI signal potential for a correction. Earnings data show some volatility, requiring further investigation to fully understand the trend.  The expected long-term return is positive relative to the benchmark, but risk should be considered, especially given the high RSI value and the relatively high Market Risk Indicator.  Further analysis is needed to confirm the long-term investment thesis.  Thorough due diligence and consideration of the inherent risks in the energy sector are crucial before making any investment decisions.
