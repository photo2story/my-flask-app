**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $137.30
* **5-day Moving Average:** $135.76
* **20-day Moving Average:** $148.81
* **60-day Moving Average:** $153.31

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price change of $2.67 (from $133.73) shows a modest positive movement.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 25.81 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.8964 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.5 (Short-term upward trend)

The indicators present a mixed picture.  The oversold RSI suggests potential upward pressure, but the negative PPO and the price being below moving averages indicate bearish momentum. The recent price increase is noticeable, reflecting market conditions, but not significantly substantial enough to immediately be classified as a sharp upward movement. The expected return of 36.6% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is positive.

Technical indicators suggest a mixed outlook, with potential for upward movement but also bearish signals.

The projected long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500 warrants further investigation, considering the volatility of energy prices.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the company's future prospects and industry trends, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
