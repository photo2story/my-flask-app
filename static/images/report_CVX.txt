* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 108.62%
* **Return Difference (CVX vs VOO):** -36.0%

**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Chevron Corp is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies, engaged in exploration, production, and refining of crude oil and natural gas.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), CVX has underperformed significantly, lagging behind by 36% in cumulative returns. However, considering the historical volatility of their relative performance (relative divergence of 30.5%), this underperformance is relatively less extreme than it might seem at first glance.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different years, indicating varying levels of risk and outperformance relative to the market.  Noteworthy is the substantial positive alpha in 2020-2022 (82% MDD) which contributed significantly to the overall return. The consistently high Market capitalization reflects the company's large size and market dominance.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $153.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $155.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $151.63

The price is currently trading above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term positive momentum. However, it is slightly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a less clear longer-term trend.  The recent price change of $2.22 reflects a significant daily increase.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.93 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.2553 (Slightly negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 7.9% over the long term (2+ years).

The relatively small positive change in relative divergence indicates only a mild upward momentum. Given the relatively neutral RSI and slightly negative PPO, the market reaction to the recent price jump of 2.22  is moderate, suggesting caution.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in EPS and revenue. While revenue remains relatively stable, EPS shows fluctuation, potentially reflecting changes in profitability margins, operational costs or other factors. Further analysis of these fluctuations is necessary to fully assess the financial health of the company. Note that there appears to be a duplicated entry for 2024-11-07.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Chevron has shown significant variability in performance in recent years. While the long-term outlook suggests a potential for outperformance against the S&P 500 (7.9% projected excess return), the recent underperformance and mixed signals from technical indicators and earnings suggest a cautious approach.  The company's fundamentals appear relatively solid, however more detailed analysis (including debt levels, competitive landscape, and future industry projections) is needed for a thorough evaluation.  The significant daily price jump warrants further investigation to understand the underlying market drivers. The current slightly positive short-term trend should be viewed cautiously given the mixed signals from longer-term indicators.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy might be considered if the investor's risk tolerance aligns with the inherent volatility of the energy sector and the potential for continued market fluctuations.
