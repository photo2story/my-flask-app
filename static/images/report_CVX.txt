## Chevron Corp (CVX) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

CVX, Chevron Corp, is an integrated energy company.  The provided data shows mixed signals regarding CVX's performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO). While it has exhibited strong cumulative returns (70.15%), it lags significantly behind the S&P 500's performance (121.84%).  This underperformance is notable, especially considering the recent period of high energy prices. Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons for this lag.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The cumulative return of CVX (70.15%) significantly trails the S&P 500 (VOO) return (121.84%), resulting in a current negative divergence of -51.7%. This places it at the 18.8th percentile of its historical range of divergence (max: 57.7, min: -77.1).

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta fluctuates around 1).  Positive Alpha values suggest outperformance, while negative values indicate underperformance compared to the market. The significant variation in Alpha across different years points to sensitivity to market conditions and cyclical energy sector trends.  High CAGR values in certain periods don't necessarily translate to consistent outperformance in all periods.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2015-2017  | 37.0% | 2.4% | 9.0% | 0.1 | 162.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 20.0% | 8.1% | 2.0% | 0.5 | 146.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 6.0% | 8.1% | -25.0% | 1.1 | 169.3 |
| 2018-2020  | -37.0% | 21.0% | -65.0% | -0.2 | 125.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 16.0% | 21.0% | -55.0% | -0.4 | 183.4 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock price shows a relatively stable recent performance, with the closing price ($155.34) slightly below the 5-day moving average ($155.87) and above the 20-day ($155.09) and 60-day ($154.06) moving averages. This suggests a relatively flat trend, neither sharply bullish nor bearish.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (46.1):** Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, leaning slightly towards the oversold territory.
* **PPO (0.052):** A positive value indicates a bullish momentum, albeit weak.
* **Relative Divergence:**  The recent negative change in relative divergence (-0.3) suggests a short-term bearish trend.  The absence of a "None" value indicates no dramatic price swings (like sudden jumps or drops).
* **Expected Return (16.2%):** This indicates a positive expected return over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, exceeding the expected return of the S&P 500.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data is inconsistent, containing duplicate entries.  There's no clear trend in EPS or revenue. Further analysis with complete and consistent data is necessary.  A single quarter's data (e.g. 2024-11-07) has different EPS and revenue values showing an inconsistency.

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출         |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 2.49 | 48.93 B$      |
| 2024-08-07 | 2.43 | 49.57 B$      |
| 2024-05-02 | 2.99 | 46.58 B$      |
| 2023-11-02 | 3.48 | 51.92 B$      |
| 2024-11-07 | 3.48 | 51.92 B$      |


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This crucial information is required to fully assess CVX's financial health and profitability.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

CVX shows mixed signals. While it has a positive long-term expected return exceeding the S&P 500, its recent performance lags behind the benchmark index.  The inconsistent Alpha and Beta, coupled with incomplete financial and earnings data, prevents a definitive assessment.  More comprehensive data, including complete financial statements and consistent earnings data, is needed for a robust and reliable analysis.  The relatively flat short-term price movement and slightly bearish technical indicators suggest caution before making any investment decisions.
