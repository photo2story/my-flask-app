## Chevron Corp (CVX) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Chevron Corp (CVX), an integrated energy company engaged in exploration, production, and refining of oil and natural gas, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While CVX showed a cumulative return of 57.01%, VOO achieved a cumulative return of 120.68%.  This represents a difference of -63.7%, placing it at the 9.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided Alpha values consistently show little to no outperformance against the market benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $143.98
* **5-day Moving Average:** $142.96
* **20-day Moving Average:** $152.81
* **60-day Moving Average:** $153.58

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend.  The significant difference between the current price and the 20 and 60-day moving averages indicates a substantial price decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (18.91):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound. However, it's crucial to consider this in conjunction with other indicators and overall market conditions.
* **PPO (-0.91):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Divergence:** -4.7, indicating a recent short-term decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 35.3%  This implies a significant outperformance expectation compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, despite the current underperformance.  However, this prediction must be viewed cautiously, as it does not account for unforeseen market events or changes in Chevron's business.  The current price is not significantly high enough to suggest immediate drastic movement (like a sharp rebound or drop).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both revenue and EPS:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates between $46.58B and $51.92B over the last four quarters, showing no clear consistent upward or downward trend.
* **EPS:**  Significant decrease from Q1 2024 ($2.99) to Q2 2024 ($2.43) and Q3 2024 ($2.49), followed by a repeat of the Q4 2023 EPS in Q4 2024.  This suggests some inconsistency in earnings performance.  Without information on expected earnings, we cannot assess whether these results represent beats or misses.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuation, and profit margins are relatively stable, hovering around 30%, though showing a slight downward trend in recent quarters.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions are provided within the given data.  To gain a comprehensive understanding, review recent financial news sources for updates on Chevron's performance and market outlook.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Chevron's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, showing a significant negative divergence. While technical indicators like the RSI suggest oversold conditions and potential for a rebound, other metrics, such as the PPO and recent relative strength divergence point to continuing bearish sentiment.  Earnings data reveals fluctuations in revenue and EPS, without sufficient information to judge against expectations.  The high projected long-term return (35.3%) should be treated with caution, as it is based on limited information.  Further research is required to determine the underlying reasons for the underperformance and the validity of the projected long-term return.  Thorough analysis of recent news, analyst opinions, and macroeconomic factors is essential before making any investment decisions.
