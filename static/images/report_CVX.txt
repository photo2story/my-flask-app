CVX has demonstrated strong historical performance, but recent data suggests a potential short-term correction.

While the long-term expected return is positive, the current market price might be overvalued.  Investors should carefully monitor the price action, RSI, and earnings reports before making investment decisions. The recent price drop supports this caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the fluctuating EPS and ROE is recommended for a comprehensive assessment.
