## Chevron Corp (CVX) Investment Report

**1. Performance Summary & Relative Strength:**

Chevron Corp (CVX) is an integrated energy company engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, refining, and marketing.  Over the analyzed period, CVX achieved a cumulative return of 64.65%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 121.78%.  The difference represents a lag of -57.1 percentage points.  This places its relative performance at the 14.8th percentile based on historical maximum and minimum deviations from the S&P 500.  While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has varied significantly year-over-year, reflecting the volatility of the energy sector, recent years have shown stronger performance.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows consistently low Alpha values (around 0), suggesting that CVX's returns have largely tracked the market (Beta is also consistently around 0).  This indicates a low level of excess return compared to the market benchmark.  Note that this data is limited and may not fully capture the nuances of its performance compared to broader market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $149.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $154.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $158.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.83

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price is significantly lower than the 5 and 20-day averages, hinting at a possible period of consolidation or potential further downward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 24.54 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.93 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -6.8% – Indicates a recent weakening in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – This suggests that, based on the provided data, there is no expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is likely due to the lack of significant alpha, as detailed in the alpha/beta analysis.
* **Current Price Consideration:** Given that the price ($149.36) is below the moving averages, and there's no indication of a recent sharp price movement (positive or negative) based on the provided data, it cannot be determined if a sharp change is likely. Further analysis is needed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals a mixed picture:

* **Revenue:** Shows some fluctuation.  Revenue was highest in Q3 2023 ($51.92B), declining slightly over the next two quarters. There was an apparent inconsistency in the data with two identical entries for 2024-11-07 (3.48B) in revenue and EPS which may indicate an error in the dataset provided.
* **EPS:**  EPS also demonstrates fluctuation.  It peaked in Q4 2023 ($3.48) and declined through subsequent quarters.  Again, the duplicate entry needs to be addressed.
* **Profitability:**  Profit margins generally hover around the 29% mark with slight fluctuations, with a brief dip in Q2 2024.
* **No Expectations Comparison:** The dataset lacks information on whether these numbers exceeded or missed analyst expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, with some quarter-to-quarter variation. Profit margins display modest fluctuation around 30%.
* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity fluctuates; ROE varies with a notable drop in Q4 2023, likely reflecting market conditions affecting profitability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**  No information on recent news, market outlook, or analyst opinions is available in the provided data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

CVX has underperformed the S&P 500 considerably over the observation period. While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term rebound due to oversold conditions, the negative PPO and downward-trending moving averages point towards a bearish short-term outlook.  The provided financial data reveals some volatility in both revenue and EPS.  The lack of alpha and the consistent underperformance compared to the S&P 500 casts doubt on the prospects of outperforming the market, unless the market shifts its priorities in a way that favors the energy sector.  The missing news and analyst data prevent a complete assessment of current market sentiment and future prospects.  The seemingly duplicated data point requires clarification.  Further investigation is necessary to fully evaluate CVX's investment potential.
