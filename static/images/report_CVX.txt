**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $157.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $157.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $155.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $153.74

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.  The recent price change of $0.62 (0.39%) indicates a modest upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 70.27  (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.18 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +5.5% (Positive short-term momentum)

The high RSI value suggests the stock may be overbought and prone to a correction. However, the positive PPO and recent relative strength indicate continued upward momentum in the short term. The provided price change reflects a modest upward movement, not a sharp increase. The expected return of 11.3% over a long-term horizon (2+ years) suggests potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this is just a prediction and not guaranteed.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  Revenue is relatively stable, but EPS shows significant fluctuations. Further investigation is needed to determine the reasons behind these variations (e.g., seasonal factors, changes in oil prices).

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출         |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 2.49  | $48.93 B     |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

CVX has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent price movements show a positive short-term trend, technical indicators suggest potential overbought conditions.  Earnings and financial data exhibit some volatility, requiring deeper investigation into the underlying causes.  The projected long-term expected return suggests potential outperformance, but this requires confirmation through further analysis and is subject to market conditions.  A more comprehensive analysis, including a deeper dive into sector trends, macroeconomic factors, and company-specific news, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
