* **20-Day Moving Average:** 145.9
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 152.74

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests bearish momentum. However, the high expected return suggests potential long-term growth exceeding the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue          |
|------------|-------|-------------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 2.49  | 48.93 B$         |
| 2024-08-07 | 2.43  | 49.57 B$         |

| 2023-11-02 | 3.48  | 51.92 B$         |
| 2024-11-07 | 3.48  | 51.92 B$         |  *(Duplicate entry - potential data error)*

There's a noticeable decline in EPS and revenue in recent quarters (Q2 and Q3 2024).  The duplicate entry for November 2024 needs clarification. Further investigation is needed to determine the trend and underlying reasons for the decrease.


**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was available. This is a significant gap in the analysis and prevents a comprehensive assessment of Chevron's financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

CVX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in the long term, although it showed periods of both positive and negative alpha. Recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, supported by bearish technical indicators.  However, the projected long-term expected return remains positive.  The recent earnings data shows a concerning decline, and the lack of complete financial information hinders a full evaluation.  Further investigation is required, especially clarifying the duplicated earnings data and obtaining missing financial statements, before drawing definitive conclusions about the investment potential of CVX.  The substantial uncertainty surrounding the financial data and recent earning trends makes a strong buy recommendation difficult at this time.
