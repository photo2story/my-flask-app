## Chevron Corp (CVX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Chevron Corp (CVX) is an American multinational energy corporation.  Over the given period, CVX's cumulative return (70.71%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO)'s cumulative return (112.47%). The difference is -41.8%, placing it at the 26.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $155.35
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $151.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $147.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.62

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, the relatively high RSI (see below) indicates a potentially overbought condition.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 91.18 – Extremely overbought, suggesting a high probability of a near-term correction.
* **PPO:** 0.93 – Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +9.0 – Suggests short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 10.8% – This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with consistent investment.  Given the current price ($155.35), which is relatively high, there is a risk of a significant correction.  The extremely high RSI supports this.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-07 | $2.49  | $48.93B       |
| 2024-08-07 | $2.43  | $49.57B       |

| 2024-11-07 | $3.48  | $51.92B       | *(Note: Duplicate entry.  Presumably an error.)*


Earnings show some volatility.  There's a noticeable decline in EPS from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024, followed by a (potentially erroneous) identical data point in Q4 2024.  Revenue fluctuates but remains largely consistent.  A more thorough analysis would be needed to draw definitive conclusions.  Clarification is needed on the duplicated data entry.

| 2024-09-30  | $156.20B    | 2.87%         |
| 2024-06-30  | $159.23B    | 2.78%         |

| 2023-09-30  | $165.26B    | 3.95%         |

Equity is relatively stable, while ROE shows some variability.  The lower ROE in Q4 2023 is noteworthy and requires further investigation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

CVX has shown strong performance in recent years, particularly in 2020-2022. However, its current valuation appears overextended based on the extremely high RSI. While the expected long-term return is positive compared to the S&P 500, the risk of a near-term correction is significant due to the overbought conditions.  Further investigation into the duplicated data point in the earnings report and the lower ROE in Q4 2023 is recommended before making any investment decisions. The recent price trend is positive, but indicators like RSI suggest caution.  A more detailed fundamental analysis, including a thorough review of the company's long-term strategic plans, is warranted.
