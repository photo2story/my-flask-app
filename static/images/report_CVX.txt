Beta is generally low, suggesting CVX has not closely tracked market movements.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values in some periods indicate significant potential losses. The negative Alpha in recent periods (2017-2019, 2018-2020, 2019-2021, 2022-2024, 2023-2025) is concerning, suggesting the stock is underperforming relative to risk.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 148.6535

**Analysis:** The price has decreased by -0.89. The current price is below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting potential short-term downward pressure, but with overall price still trending up in recent months.  The fact that the 20-day moving average is above the 60-day moving average indicates an upward price trend over the intermediate term (20~60 days).
