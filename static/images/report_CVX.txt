*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is high across all periods, indicating significant potential for loss.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is the excess return of the investment relative to the return of the market. Negative values in recent periods suggest Chevron has significantly underperformed its benchmark. Note the very negative Alpha in the 2023-2025 period.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally below 1, suggesting that Chevron's price is less volatile than the overall market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization fluctuates, showing the company's size and relative value.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 147.75
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 147.75, 'previousClose': 147.69, 'change': 0.04}
*   **5-day SMA:** 148.30
*   **20-day SMA:** 149.69
*   **60-day SMA:** 152.64

**Analysis:**

Chevron's current price (147.75) is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs).  The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which in turn is below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term and medium-term downward trend. The minimal change between the last price and previous close suggests low volatility on the last trading day.

**3) RSI, PPO Index Indicators, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 43.99
*   **PPO:** -0.08
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (8 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-11)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (단기하락 - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 851.8%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI of 43.99 is near the oversold threshold (30) but not quite there, implying the stock might be nearing a potential bounce.
*   The negative PPO (-0.08) indicates that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, confirming the downward trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a "Buy" recommendation, allocating 100% of cash. The "Very Safe" designation seems to contradict the high expected return, which could suggest an error in the underlying model or overly optimistic assumptions.
*   The recent relative divergence indicates a short-term decline.
*   The extremely high Expected Return (851.8%) is highly suspect and should be viewed with extreme skepticism. It's likely a model error or based on unrealistic assumptions.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

|------------|------|-----------|

Recent EPS (Earnings Per Share) has been inconsistent. Revenue has also fluctuated. The most recent EPS is significantly lower than the EPS from a year earlier, this is likely a typo and should be 2024-11-07, but the revenue is down slightly.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $48.17B    | 31.12%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity       | ROE     |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| 2025-09-30 | $189.84B    | 1.86%   |
| 2025-06-30 | $146.42B    | 1.70%   |
| 2025-03-31 | $149.24B    | 2.35%   |
| 2024-12-31 | $152.32B    | 2.13%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $156.20B    | 2.87%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue has been relatively stable but has seen some fluctuations. Profit margins have improved over the last few quarters.
*   **Capital & Profitability:** Equity has increased substantially in the most recent quarter, while ROE (Return on Equity) has declined. This increase may be due to stock issuance, debt, or other capital structure changes. The lower ROE despite higher equity might suggest that the company is not efficiently utilizing its equity to generate profits, as could be the explanation.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Chevron is currently underperforming the S&P 500, with a significant negative divergence. Recent stock price trends indicate a short-term downward trend, with the price below key moving averages. Analyst consensus is "Buy," but the wide range in target prices reflects uncertainty. The news flow is mixed, with positive developments (analyst upgrades, increased holdings) offset by concerns about geopolitical risks and stagnant stock price. Earnings have been inconsistent, and ROE has declined despite increasing equity.

**Key Concerns:**

*   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   Downward price trend.
*   Declining ROE.
*   Geopolitical risks (Venezuela).

**Potential Positives:**

*   Analyst "Buy" consensus and target prices above the current price.
*   Institutional investors increasing holdings.
*   Improving profit margins.
*   LNG deals.

**Overall Assessment:**

Chevron presents a mixed picture. While analyst opinions are positive, the stock is currently facing headwinds. Investors should carefully consider the risks and potential rewards before investing. The extremely high "expected return" should be ignored.
