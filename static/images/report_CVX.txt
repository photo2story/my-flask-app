**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B)  |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| 2015-2017  | 33.0%  | 65.9%  | 5.0%    | 0.1    | 252.2   |
| 2016-2018  | 21.0%  | 71.9%  | 6.0%    | 0.2    | 219.2   |
| 2017-2019  | 3.0%   | 71.9%  | -19.0%   | 0.9    | 242.8   |
| 2018-2020  | -10.0% | 79.6%  | -33.0%   | 0.7    | 170.2   |
| 2019-2021  | 22.0%  | 79.6%  | -25.0%   | 0.6    | 236.4   |
| 2020-2022  | 85.0%  | 83.2%  | 86.0%    | 0.3    | 361.6   |
| 2021-2023  | 49.0%  | 83.2%  | 47.0%    | 0.4    | 300.5   |
| 2022-2024  | -6.0%  | 83.2%  | -26.0%   | 0.2    | 291.8   |
| 2023-2025  | -50.0% | 74.8%  | -113.0% | 0.6    | 297.6   |

**Analysis:**
* **CAGR:** The Compounded Average Growth Rate shows significant volatility.  2020-2022 period shows a boom, while the latest period (2023-2025) indicates a sharp decline.
* **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant downside risk in all periods.
* **Alpha:**  The alpha is negative for most recent periods, significantly negative in the last.  This signifies underperformance relative to the market. The outlier period of 2020-2022 skews the perception because alpha is exceptionally high.
* **Beta:** The beta values are generally below 1, which *theoretically* suggests lower volatility than the market, but with such high MDD, that would not be true.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 147.69
*   **Last-market:** price: 147.69, previousClose: 149.52, change: -1.22
*   **5-day SMA:** 148.75
*   **20-day SMA:** 149.82
*   **60-day SMA:** 152.85

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three simple moving averages (SMA), indicating a short-term downward trend.  The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and the 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA, reinforcing this downward momentum. The last market price change of -1.22 shows a recent decline.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 41.21
*   **PPO:** -0.0691
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (8 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 851.8%

**Analysis:**
*   The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI of 41.21 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), which *could* suggest a potential buying opportunity.  However, it's not yet definitively oversold.
*   The negative PPO (-0.0691) confirms the short-term downward trend, indicating that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average.
*   The hybrid signal indicates a strong buy recommendation according to the system, which is high risk due to 0% cash allocation.
*   The 20-day relative divergence change confirms a recent short-term decline.
*   The **extremely high expected return of 851.8% should be viewed with extreme skepticism.**  It is highly unlikely to be accurate and should not be the sole basis for an investment decision.

*   **Mixed News:** Recent news headlines are mixed, with some articles pointing to challenges and price declines, while others highlight potential growth drivers.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analyst consensus is "Buy" with a potential upside target price, but the target price range indicates uncertainty.
