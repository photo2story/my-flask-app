## Chevron Corp (CVX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Chevron Corp (CVX) is an American multinational energy corporation.  As of the last data point, CVX's cumulative return (77.43%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (118.37%), resulting in a difference of -40.9%.  This places its relative performance at the 26.9th percentile compared to its historical range (-77.1% to +57.7%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed performance over different periods. While exhibiting strong positive CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in some years (e.g., 76% from 2020-2022), there were also periods of significant negative returns (e.g., -40% from 2018-2020).  The consistently low or zero Alpha suggests the stock's performance closely tracks the market, and the beta is not provided explicitly.  The relatively stable market capitalization of $288B is noteworthy.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The closing price is $161.47.  The 5-day moving average is $158.29, the 20-day moving average is $148.85, and the 60-day moving average is $153.30.  The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (92.6):**  Extremely overbought, indicating potential for a short-term correction.
* **PPO (1.29):** Positive, suggesting bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+2.3):** Shows a recent increase in relative strength.

The current price ($161.47) does not suggest a dramatic price jump or crash, considering it's above the moving averages and showing recent relative strength.  The expected return of 10.4% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is optimistic but depends heavily on future market conditions and energy sector performance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility. While revenue generally remained high, the EPS (Earnings Per Share) fluctuated.  Note the duplicate entry for 2024-11-07. This needs clarification as it contains identical data to the 2023-11-02 entry.  A more consistent and accurate data source is needed for a meaningful analysis.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 2.49 | 48.93        |
| 2024-08-07 | 2.43 | 49.57        |
| 2024-05-02 | 2.99 | 46.58        |
| 2023-11-02 | 3.48 | 51.92        |
| **2023-11-02 (duplicate?)** | **3.48** | **51.92** |


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability data show fluctuations.  Profit margins have generally been around 30%, and while revenue is relatively consistent, it's slightly decreased in some quarters. ROE (Return on Equity) is also volatile, suggesting inconsistent profitability.   More historical data is needed for a conclusive analysis.

| Quarter    | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | 48.93        | 29.15%        | 156.20       | 2.87    |
| 2024-06-30 | 49.57        | 29.66%        | 159.23       | 2.78    |
| 2024-03-31 | 46.58        | 31.66%        | 160.62       | 3.42    |
| 2023-12-31 | 48.93        | 29.02%        | 160.96       | 1.40    |
| 2023-09-30 | 51.92        | 29.99%        | 165.26       | 3.95    |


**7. Overall Summary:**

CVX's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, although it has shown periods of strong growth in the past. Technical indicators suggest an overbought condition, potentially indicating a short-term correction.  Earnings and financial data reveal some volatility but generally show a healthy company with consistent revenue and relatively high profit margins.  Long-term prospects depend on future energy market conditions and the company's strategic decisions.  The provided data is incomplete and potentially contains errors (duplicate entry in earnings data), limiting the robustness of this analysis.  More complete and verified data is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.
