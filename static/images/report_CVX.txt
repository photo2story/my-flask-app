The difference is -44.01%, placing it at the 28.16th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (73.73):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.48):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+8.61):** Shows a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return is 0%.  This likely represents a short-term outlook and doesn't reflect the long-term potential.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy, with regular contributions, could potentially outperform the S&P 500, but this requires further analysis and consideration of factors not included in this report. The 0% figure should be interpreted cautiously.  A more robust model is needed for a reliable prediction.  The current price ($161.43) being slightly above the last market price suggests no significant sudden price changes (no sharp upward or downward movements).

The provided earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue.  Note that the data for 2024-11-07 appears duplicated.

The provided data alone does not offer a complete picture.  To fully assess recent performance, it is crucial to compare actual results with expected values.

**5. Financial Information:**

The provided quarterly data shows consistent profitability with profit margins fluctuating around 30%. ROE shows some variability, suggesting the company's profitability is subject to market fluctuations. A more detailed analysis is required to assess the financial health completely.  The data lacks sufficient context to draw strong conclusions.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Analysis of Recent News (Missing):** The report lacks information on recent news items (within the last 2 days) from sources like shacknews or others. The request for analysis of analyst opinions, performance highlights from sources like FINBOLD, and a recent market outlook is also missing. This information is critical for a complete investment assessment.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

CVX's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, but shows signs of short-term upward momentum based on moving averages. Technical indicators suggest caution due to RSI nearing overbought levels. Financial performance has been relatively stable, but a detailed comparison with analyst expectations is needed.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions significantly hinders a comprehensive evaluation.  More data is needed to form a conclusive opinion about long-term investment prospects.  The 0% expected return should be considered unreliable without further analysis and a more robust forecasting model.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the incomplete data and lack of recent news analysis,  a definitive buy/sell/hold recommendation cannot be made.  Further investigation into recent news, analyst opinions, and a thorough comparison of actual vs. expected financial performance is required before forming a well-informed investment decision.  A more complete dataset is critical for performing more detailed and relevant analysis.  Consider seeking professional financial advice before making any investment decisions.
