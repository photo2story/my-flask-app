**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $139.07
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $136.93
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $145.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.74

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.75 (from $136.68 to $139.07) could indicate a temporary rebound, but the overall trend appears bearish.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 34.54 (Potentially oversold; below 30 often signifies oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.29 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.9 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 42.7% (Long-term expected excess return over S&P 500)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest the stock might be oversold. However,  the medium risk MRI and negative relative divergence warrant caution. The substantial expected long-term return could be attractive to investors with a long-term horizon. The recent price increase is noteworthy but should be considered within the broader context of the downward trend.
