Chevron's stock performance has lagged behind the broader market (S&P 500) in the recent past. While technical indicators suggest some short-term upward momentum, its high RSI indicates potential for a correction.

**7. Conclusion:**

While Chevron's current price action suggests a potential short-term correction, its long-term prospects remain positive. Investors looking for dividend growth and exposure to the energy sector may consider adding Chevron to their portfolios.
