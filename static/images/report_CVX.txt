The last period shows a very negative Alpha, which means it lagged significantly from S&P 500. The beta has been consistently below 1, suggesting Chevron has been less volatile than the overall market, but it has fluctuated a bit.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 149.97
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 149.94, Previous Close: 152.54, Change: -1.7
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 149.778
    *   20-day SMA: 152.793
    *   60-day SMA: 154.5348

*   **Analysis:** The stock is trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The recent price change of -1.7 indicates a decline from the previous close.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Market Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.25 (Approaching oversold territory)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.2599
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (12 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Dividend_1.71 (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-18)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** -6.1 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 994.9% (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)

*   **Analysis:** The RSI is approaching oversold, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, but this should be viewed in conjunction with other indicators.  The PPO is negative, supporting the downward price movement.  The hybrid signal suggests buying and a low cash ratio. The MRI suggests medium investment risk, somewhat contradicting the RSI, which indicates oversold conditions. A notable divergence change indicates it's on a short-term decline. The extremely high expected return should be taken with caution, as it might be based on specific model assumptions.

    *   Significantly underperforming the S&P 500 over the considered period.
    *   Short-term price downtrend (below moving averages).
    *   Negative PPO.
    *   Recent negative divergence change.
*   **Positive Indicators:**
    *   MRI suggests "Medium Investment".
    *   Analyst consensus is "Buy."
    *   Healthy profit margins.
    *   Brandes Investment Partners purchased shares.
    *   The high expected return.
*   **Mixed Indicators:**
