This report analyzes Chevron Corp (CVX), an integrated energy company engaged in exploration, production, and refining of oil and gas.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

CVX's cumulative return is 73.06%, while the S&P 500's is 120.40%.  The difference is -47.3%, placing it at the 22nd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-77.0% to 57.8%).  This indicates CVX has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the measured period.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows an alpha consistently near zero across multiple years, suggesting CVX's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta is also near 0, but needs clarification regarding the scale and what this beta relates to, as usually Beta =1 is the market).  The CAGR varies significantly year-to-year, reflecting the volatility of the energy sector.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates, reflecting changes in valuation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $157.0 (Last Market: $156.15)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $157.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $159.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.13

The price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The slight difference between the last market price and the closing price might be due to after-hours trading.  The price is close to both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting potential price consolidation or minor support levels.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (43.06):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning towards oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.64):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-3.8):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  This suggests that, based on the provided data, long-term (2+ years) returns are expected to be similar to the S&P 500, not exceeding it. This warrants further investigation as the data provided has no details on the model or assumptions used in the Expected Return calculation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

There are inconsistencies in the provided earnings data (two entries for 2024-11-07).  Using only unique entries and focusing on the reported numbers:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates, showing no clear upward or downward trend over the provided period.  There is no consistent growth pattern over time.
* **EPS:** Shows considerable variability. EPS decreased significantly from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024 and then slightly increased in Q3 2024. This volatility points to significant influences on Chevron's profitability.  More information is needed to draw definitive conclusions.
* **Comparison:** Without expectations data, it's impossible to determine whether results beat or missed forecasts.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margin shows some fluctuation, falling slightly in the last two quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity fluctuates slightly, and Return on Equity (ROE) varies considerably, reflecting changes in profitability and shareholder value.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Information on market outlook is needed to complete this section.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

CVX has underperformed the S&P 500 over the specified period. Recent price action shows some bearish short-term signals, but longer-term indicators are more neutral. Technical indicators are mixed. Earnings data shows volatility in both revenue and EPS, lacking a clear trend.  Profitability, as measured by profit margins and ROE, shows variability.  Further investigation is needed to assess the long-term potential of CVX, particularly regarding the expected return of 0.0% against the S&P500 and the inconsistent data on EPS and revenue.  More complete data, including analyst expectations and recent news, is crucial for a more comprehensive evaluation.  The alpha near zero and the apparent large beta variations require a clear explanation of their derivation and the underlying assumptions in the financial model used.
