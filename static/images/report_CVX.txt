*   **Venezuela Blockade Risk:** The news about Venezuela blockade risk is particularly relevant as it could significantly impact Chevron's oil production.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** Wells Fargo raising the price target to $196 provides a counterpoint to the more negative news, suggesting that some analysts see potential upside.
*   **Berkshire Hathaway:** Inclusion in Berkshire Hathaway's Dividend Aristocrats list could indicate stability and dividend reliability.

*   **Consensus:** Buy (2.08)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 172.33 / High: 204.00 / Low: 124.00

**Analysis:** Despite recent struggles, analyst consensus remains positive with a "Buy" rating. The average target price of $172.33 suggests a potential upside from the current price of $147.69. However, a wide range between high and low targets indicates uncertainty. The lack of recent rating changes suggests that analysts are still evaluating the situation.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출     |
|------------|------|----------|
| 2025-11-06 | 1.83 | 48.17 B$ |

**Analysis:** Revenue has fluctuated, but profit margins have generally increased over the past year. The increase in equity suggests Chevron's financial strength, but ROE (Return on Equity) has decreased, indicating a less efficient use of equity to generate profits.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Chevron (CVX) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence in cumulative returns. While analyst consensus remains a "Buy," recent stock price trends are downwards, reflected in the moving averages and RSI. Earnings and revenue have shown a decreasing trend in recent quarters. News headlines highlight potential risks and concerns, particularly regarding Venezuela. While equity has increased, ROE has decreased, suggesting reduced efficiency. The exceptionally high Expected Return (%) should be viewed cautiously.

**Overall:**

Chevron appears to be facing short-term headwinds. While its financial position remains strong, declining earnings and geopolitical risks are weighing on the stock price. Investors should carefully consider these factors and weigh the potential upside against the inherent risks. The high expected return, while potentially enticing, warrants further investigation to understand its underlying assumptions and feasibility.
