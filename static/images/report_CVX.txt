## Chevron Corp (CVX) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Chevron Corp (CVX), an integrated energy company engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, refining, marketing, and transportation, has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for CVX is 65.16%, while VOO's is 115.41%. This results in a difference of -50.3%, placing it at the 19.9th percentile of the historical range of differences (minimum -77.1%, maximum 57.7%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows an alpha consistently close to zero across various periods, suggesting that CVX's performance has largely tracked the market (beta is also near zero which is unusual and possibly an error in the data).  However, the CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) vary significantly from year to year, highlighting the volatility inherent in the energy sector.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $150.30
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $148.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $147.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.42

The price is currently above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend but possible resistance at the 60-day average.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.72 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.53 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +3.8% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 15.7% above S&P 500

The indicators suggest a moderately bullish outlook.  The current price of $150.30 doesn't necessarily indicate a significant recent price jump or drop based on the provided moving averages. The expected return is positive, implying potential outperformance of the S&P 500 in the long term.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals some volatility:

* **EPS:** Fluctuated, with a dip in the most recent quarter (2.49) compared to previous quarters (2.99 and 3.48).
* **Revenue:** Shows some fluctuation, but generally remained relatively stable around $50B, except for a dip in Q1 2024.
* **Note:** The table has duplicate entries for 2024-11-07, making it difficult to ascertain exact trends.  Clarification is needed.

Without further information (like expected EPS & Revenue) it's impossible to confidently assess whether the reported numbers beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:** Fluctuated in the past few quarters.  Q2 2024 was higher than Q1, which was lower than Q4 2023, and Q4 2024 was lower than Q3 2023.
* **Profit Margin:** Generally remained relatively stable within a narrow range (29%-32%), experiencing a slight dip in the latest quarter.
* **Equity:**  Showed slight fluctuations, generally holding steady.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** Fluctuated significantly, highlighting the volatility of the energy sector's profitability.

Overall, the financial figures show some instability but generally stable profitability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information.  Details on recent earnings news within the last two days, market outlook, and analyst opinions are needed to complete the analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

CVX has shown a lower cumulative return than VOO, but some positive short-term indicators, including a positive PPO and rising 20-day relative strength.  However, recent earnings reports show some volatility in both EPS and Revenue.  Long-term projections suggest potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500, however the alpha being consistently near zero across various periods indicates that CVX's returns are highly correlated to overall market performance and the firm's risk profile has not generated returns above those of the broad market.  A more thorough analysis requires additional data, specifically clarification on the duplicated earnings data, information on the recent news and analyst sentiment, and an understanding of the unusually low Beta values.  The reported beta values near zero in the provided dataset are suspect and likely an error.
