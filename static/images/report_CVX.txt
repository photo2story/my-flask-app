## Chevron Corp (CVX) Stock Analysis Report

**Executive Summary:** Chevron Corp (CVX), an integrated energy company, has shown a cumulative return of 70.15% significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 121.84% over the same period. While recent earnings show some volatility,  the stock currently trades slightly below its 20-day moving average, suggesting potential for modest upside.  Further analysis of the provided financial data is limited due to the unavailability of key metrics.  A long-term investment strategy could potentially yield a 16.2% excess return over the S&P 500, but this should be considered with caution given the data limitations.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

CVX's cumulative return (70.15%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return (121.84%), resulting in a current negative divergence of -51.7%.  This places CVX in the 18.8th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha and beta data reveals substantial volatility in performance relative to the market (beta varies significantly year-over-year),  and inconsistent alpha, ranging from highly negative to moderately positive.  This highlights the impact of macroeconomic factors (e.g., oil prices) on CVX's performance.  Large fluctuations in CAGR also suggest considerable risk associated with investing in this stock.

* **Closing Price:** 155.34
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 155.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 155.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 154.06

The price is currently slightly below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potentially mild bearish trend in the short term.  However, this is a limited observation and requires more extensive analysis.

* **PPO:** 0.052 (Positive, suggesting a slight bullish momentum)

The RSI and PPO suggest a neutral to slightly bullish outlook. However, the negative relative divergence change indicates recent short-term weakness. The expected return is positive but needs further validation given limitations in the available data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's also a duplicated data point for 2024-11-07.  A more thorough review of the data is needed to draw meaningful conclusions.


| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 2.49  | 48.93 B$    |
| 2024-08-07 | 2.43  | 49.57 B$    |
| 2024-05-02 | 2.99  | 46.58 B$    |
| 2023-11-02 | 3.48  | 51.92 B$    |
| 2024-11-07 | 3.48  | 51.92 B$    |


**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  Without these crucial figures, it is impossible to conduct a proper assessment of CVX's financial health and profitability.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

CVX has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the observed period.  While recent price action and some technical indicators suggest potential for short-term recovery, the lack of key financial data and volatile past performance create significant uncertainty.  The projected long-term excess return should be viewed with considerable caution due to the incomplete data and the company's history of substantial performance fluctuations. Further analysis with complete financial data and a more in-depth market assessment are recommended before making any investment decisions.
