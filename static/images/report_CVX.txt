2025-01-15 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Chevron Corp (CVX), incorporating the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO)**

Chevron Corp (CVX) is an American multinational energy corporation.  The cumulative return of CVX (72.41%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 112.74%. The difference is -40.3%, placing it at the 27.3rd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market index.

**2. Recent Price Movement**

* **Closing Price:** $156.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $153.06
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $147.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $152.78

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, the relatively small gap between the price and the 5-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a lack of significant momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 91.11 – This extremely high RSI suggests the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.08 – A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum, but the magnitude is relatively small.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 11.5% (positive) – Shows a recent short-term uptrend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 10.2% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500. This suggests that while CVX has underperformed historically, the model predicts future outperformance.  Given the high RSI, this prediction should be treated with caution. The current price of $156.90 does not necessarily signal a dramatic price shift (sudden surge or drop).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility.  While revenue has generally been consistent, EPS shows some decline in recent quarters (from 3.48 to 2.49).  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying reasons for this fluctuation.  Note that the data contains a duplicate entry for 2024-11-07.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue (B$) |

| 2024-11-07 | 2.49  | 48.93         |
| 2024-08-07 | 2.43  | 49.57         |
| 2024-05-02 | 2.99  | 46.58         |

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows a slight downward trend,  and ROE has been volatile, indicating some fluctuation in profitability.

**7. Overall Analysis**

CVX has underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period, but the projected long-term expected return suggests potential for future outperformance. However, this prediction should be viewed with caution due to the extremely high RSI, suggesting the stock is overbought. The recent earnings data reveals some volatility, requiring further investigation into its causes.  The current price is above its moving averages, hinting at a short-term uptrend, but the lack of significant separation between the price and the moving averages suggests a lack of strong momentum.  Overall, while the long-term outlook might be positive based on the expected return, short-term caution is warranted given the high RSI and fluctuating earnings.  Further fundamental analysis is crucial before making any investment decisions.
