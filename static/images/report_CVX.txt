| 2015-2017  | 8.1% | 20.7% | -3.4% | 1.8 | 223.2 |
| 2016-2018  | 11.4% | 17.2% | 1.6% | 1.6 | 194.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 4.7% | 17.2% | -10.2% | 1.5 | 214.9 |
| 2018-2020  | -8.9% | 53.6% | -22.7% | 1.7 | 150.6 |
| 2019-2021  | 7.1% | 53.6% | -18.9% | 1.8 | 209.2 |

| 2021-2023  | 25.9% | 24.5% | 15.4% | 1.6 | 265.9 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 160.36 (Last Market: 162.39)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 161.06
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 155.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 148.68

The price is currently above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.  However, it's still below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term trend that might require further investigation.  The slight dip from the last market close suggests a minor correction.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 70.53 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.2 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This needs further clarification and calculation based on a more robust financial model, this is just a placeholder)

The RSI is nearing overbought levels, suggesting potential for a price correction.  The positive PPO supports the bullish short-term momentum, but the high RSI acts as a cautionary signal.  The 0% expected return is insufficient and needs more information on the expected long-term growth and risks.  A 2-year expected return comparison to the S&P 500 needs a much more rigorous analysis involving forecasting models. The 162.39 last-market price is not significantly higher to indicate a sudden surge or decline.
