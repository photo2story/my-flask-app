* 20-Day Moving Average: $147.39

**7. Overall Analysis:**

CVX has shown strong performance in certain periods but underperformed the S&P 500 overall during the analyzed timeframe.  While recent price action and momentum indicators suggest a short-term bullish trend, the high RSI suggests a potential correction is possible. The company demonstrates consistent revenue and healthy profit margins.  The projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is significant and makes a case for long-term investment, although short term volatility is a consideration given current overbought conditions.  Further due diligence, considering macroeconomic factors and the energy sector's outlook, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Note that the provided alpha values of consistently 0 require further investigation or potentially a more nuanced methodology for calculating alpha given the available data.
