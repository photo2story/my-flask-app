## Chevron Corp (CVX) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Chevron Corp (CVX) is an American multinational energy corporation.  Over the measured period, CVX's cumulative return (71.04%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's return (122.16%). The difference is -51.1%, placing it at the 19.3rd percentile of the historical range of differences between the two (ranging from -77.1% to 57.7%).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $155.65
* **5-day Moving Average:** $157.56
* **20-day Moving Average:** $151.62
* **60-day Moving Average:** $153.79

The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's above its 20-day moving average, indicating some potential support. The recent price change (-$0.23 or -0.15%) shows a minor decrease.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 70.54 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.47 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -7.3% (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 16.2% (outperformance vs. S&P 500)

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and prone to a correction. The positive PPO indicates continued momentum, but the negative divergence warrants caution. The expected return is positive, but the relatively high RSI and negative divergence suggest potential short-term downside risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue          |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 2.49   | $48.93 Billion  |
| 2024-08-07 | 2.43   | $49.57 Billion  |
| 2024-05-02 | 2.99   | $46.58 Billion  |
| 2023-11-02 | 3.48   | $51.92 Billion  |
| 2024-11-07 | 3.48   | $51.92 Billion  |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-11-07.  Excluding the duplicate, we observe some fluctuation in EPS and revenue.  EPS has generally declined from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024, with a slight uptick in Q2 2024. Revenue has also fluctuated, peaking in Q4 2023 and Q2 2024.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying reasons for these fluctuations.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $48.93B   | 29.15%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $49.57B   | 29.66%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $46.58B   | 31.66%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $48.93B   | 29.02%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $51.92B   | 29.99%        |

Profit margins have been relatively stable, although there's some variation.  Revenue has been fairly consistent, with a slight decline in Q1 2024.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE   |
|---------|------------|-------|
| 2024-09-30 | $156.20B  | 2.87% |
| 2024-06-30 | $159.23B  | 2.78% |
| 2024-03-31 | $160.62B  | 3.42% |
| 2023-12-31 | $160.96B  | 1.40% |
| 2023-09-30 | $165.26B  | 3.95% |

Equity has generally decreased over the past year, and ROE shows significant variability.  A further investigation into the underlying factors driving these changes is warranted.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

CVX has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the analyzed period. While the expected long-term return is positive, the recent price action and technical indicators (high RSI, negative short-term divergence) suggest potential for short-term downside.  The company's financial performance shows some volatility in both revenue and profitability, along with a decline in equity and fluctuating ROE. Further due diligence, including analysis of the macroeconomic environment and industry trends, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate earnings data entry also requires clarification.
