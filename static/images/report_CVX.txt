| 2018-2020  | -10.0% | 79.6% | -33.0% | 0.7 | 173.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 22.0% | 79.6% | -25.0% | 0.6 | 240.9 |
| 2020-2022  | 85.0% | 83.2% | 86.0% | 0.3 | 368.4 |
| 2021-2023  | 49.0% | 83.2% | 47.0% | 0.4 | 306.1 |
| 2022-2024  | -6.0% | 83.2% | -26.0% | 0.2 | 297.3 |
| 2023-2025  | -49.0% | 74.8% | -115.0% | 0.6 | 303.2 |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuates significantly, ranging from -49% to 85%, indicating high volatility in Chevron's returns. Recent years (2022-2025 and 2023-2025) show negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, ranging from 65.9% to 83.2%, indicating substantial risk and potential for significant losses during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** Mixed performance. Positive alpha in some periods (2015-2018, 2020-2023) suggests outperformance relative to its benchmark. However, recent years show significantly negative alpha, indicating underperformance (especially in 2023-2025).
*   **Beta:** Generally low, ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. Beta values lower than 1 suggest Chevron is less volatile than the market, however this is not necessarily true due to Chevron's significant MDD.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** Indicates the size of the company. While market cap fluctuates, the recent values are relatively stable, suggesting that the company's underlying valuation has not changed dramatically.
* **Overall Analysis**: The data suggests a very volatile investment with a history of significant drawdowns. While Chevron has shown periods of outperformance (positive alpha), recent performance is concerning, with negative CAGR and alpha. The moderate beta values don't fully reflect the risks suggested by the high MDD.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 147.75
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 150.51
    *   Previous Close: 149.80
    *   Change: 0.47
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 148.30
    *   20-day SMA: 149.69
    *   60-day SMA: 152.64

*   **Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This is generally considered a bearish signal. The relatively small positive change in the last market data of 0.47, reflects the stock price bouncing within a limited range.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 43.99
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.0812
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (8 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-11)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.3 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 814.2%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A value of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 43.99 is below 50 and indicates that the stock is not overbought.
    *   **PPO:** A negative PPO value of -0.0812 indicates the stock's short-term momentum is trending slightly below its longer-term momentum.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends a "Buy" strategy and suggests that Chevron is considered very safe (MRI: 0.90). This conflicts with the MDD analysis in section 1.
    *   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change indicates short-term underperformance.
    *   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return (814.2%) should be treated with extreme caution. Such high projections are unlikely and may be based on optimistic assumptions.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Key Themes:**
    *   **Dividend Outlook:** Chevron's potential to raise its dividend is a recurring theme.
    *   **Analyst Views:** Analysis of whether Chevron is a worthwhile investment.
    *   **Comparison to Competitors:** ExxonMobil is frequently compared to Chevron.
    *   **Venezuela Shipping Crackdown**: News regarding political or regulatory factors that can impact Chevron.

*   **Impact:** The news is mixed. Potential dividend increases are positive, but concerns about valuation and performance compared to peers might be weighing on the stock.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~2.08)
*   **Target Price:**
    *   Average: 172.33
    *   High: 204.00
    *   Low: 124.00

*   **Analysis:** Analysts generally have a "Buy" rating on Chevron. The average target price suggests potential upside from the current price of 147.75. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty among analysts. The absence of recent rating changes suggests the analyst sentiment is stable.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Chevron presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Signals:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, reflected in the negative divergence. Historical data shows periods of negative alpha and significant drawdowns. Recent price action is bearish, with the stock below key moving averages, and a negative short-term relative divergence. The Hybrid signal of "Buy" does not correspond well with the significant MDD from previous periods.
*   **Positive Signals:** Analyst consensus is a "Buy" with potential upside based on target prices. News suggests potential dividend increases. Recent revenue and profit margins have increased.

**Overall Recommendation:** Given the current data, a cautious approach is advised. While analysts are optimistic, the underperformance relative to the market, high historical drawdowns, and bearish short-term technical signals raise concerns. Further research is warranted before considering an investment in Chevron. The extremely high "expected return" should be disregarded as unrealistic.
