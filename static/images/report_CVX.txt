## Chevron Corp (CVX) Investment Report

**1. Performance Summary and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Chevron Corp (CVX) is an integrated energy company engaged in oil and gas exploration, production, refining, and marketing.  Over the analyzed period, CVX's cumulative return (56.86%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (120.69%). The difference is -63.8%, placing it at the 9.9th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a below-market performance compared to the broad market index.  The alpha consistently near zero across various periods suggests it largely tracks market movements (beta near 1 implicitly indicated by the CAGR, which is a close proxy), without generating significant excess returns.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows that CVX's beta has fluctuated, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements over time.  The alpha values consistently near zero suggest that the stock's performance has largely mirrored the market's, with little alpha generation.  This is consistent with a large-cap company like Chevron and the general market trend where mega-cap stocks are heavily correlated to market index performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $143.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $142.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $153.74
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $153.67

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (21.67):** This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce. However, it's crucial to consider this in conjunction with other factors.
* **PPO (-1.09):** This negative value confirms the bearish sentiment observed in the price movement.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence (-3.2):** This signifies a recent weakening in the relative strength against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** This suggests no significant outperformance is expected relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) based on this historical data.  Given the consistent near-zero alpha, this is not surprising.  Further analysis using different models might be needed to determine potential long-term outperformance, and this prediction should be viewed as a base case based solely on the supplied data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuated over the reported quarters, showing no clear upward trend. There's no obvious pattern other than general volatility in revenue that is expected given the commodity nature of the energy business.
* **EPS:**  EPS shows significant fluctuations, with a clear downward trend from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024.  A noticeable increase occurred from Q3 to Q4 2023, but that increase was not sustained into 2024.
* **Comparison:**  The data lacks information on expectations, making it impossible to assess whether results beat or missed them.  Analyzing only actual numbers, we see substantial volatility in the quarterly results which is typical for the energy sector.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows some fluctuation, and Profit Margins also fluctuate but generally remain in the high 20% to low 30% range.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally decreased, and ROE is highly volatile, highlighting the cyclical nature of the energy industry.  The lower ROE in 2023 Q4 relative to the prior two quarters and the low ROE in 2024 Q2 highlight the challenges in interpreting ROE without understanding the company-specific drivers.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**  No specific news or analyst opinions are provided. Therefore, no analysis on recent market outlook or analyst opinions can be made.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

CVX has shown underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, implying a potential short-term bounce, the negative PPO and price movement below key moving averages suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  The recent earnings data exhibit volatility without a clear trend. The consistently near-zero alpha suggests that CVX's performance is tightly correlated to the market, with limited potential for outsized returns.  Long-term investors should consider this correlation in their investment strategies.  Given the lack of information on market expectations and current news, making further definitive investment recommendations would be speculative.
