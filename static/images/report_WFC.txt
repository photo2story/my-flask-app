No "Total Revenue" or "Gross Profit" data was provided, hindering a comprehensive financial analysis.  Further data is required for a complete picture of WFC's financial health.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **News Analysis Required:**  The prompt requested analysis of news within the last two days.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

WFC has shown periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the S&P 500. Recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations in the last report. Technical indicators suggest short-term bullish momentum but also proximity to overbought conditions, implying potential for a price correction.  However, the lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) and a detailed news analysis limit the scope of this assessment. Long-term return expectations are currently neutral compared to the S&P 500 based on available information.  A complete analysis necessitates access to real-time news, complete financial statements, and more comprehensive market data.
