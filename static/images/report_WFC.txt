## Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) is a major American multinational financial services company.  Over the period analyzed, WFC's cumulative return (85.23%) lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (123.86%) by 38.63 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -38.63 places WFC in the 59.02nd percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (ranging from -103.47% to 6.39%). This indicates that WFC's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is notable but not unprecedented within the historical context of the data provided.  The provided alpha and beta data show varying performance relative to the market, with alpha generally above 1 indicating outperformance in some periods and below in others, suggesting inconsistency.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $74.34 (Last Market: $74.36)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $73.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $67.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $60.17

The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. The relatively large gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages further supports this observation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 74.75 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a near-term pullback)
* **PPO:** 0.66 (Positive value indicates bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +23.47 (Significant positive change indicating a recent surge in relative performance)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests that over the long term (2+ years), the expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not significantly higher or lower).  This should be considered cautiously, given the limitations of the data and market volatility.  A 0.0% expected return indicates a potential for similar long-term performance to the S&P 500.  The high RSI value suggests a possible period of correction, although this is not guaranteed.

The closing price of $74.36 is very near the last market price, suggesting that there is not significant recent volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Performance and Outlook:**

The company has consistently exceeded earnings per share (EPS) expectations in recent quarters. While this is positive, it's crucial to analyze the reasons behind the beat and the sustainability of this trend. Further research into the factors driving these results is needed (e.g., cost-cutting measures, increased revenue, one-time events).  The October 2024 EPS beat of 1.52 vs. the expected 1.28 is the most significant.  Consistency in exceeding expectations is a positive sign, but future predictions require more than just historical data.

**6. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing data prevents a proper assessment of WFC's overall financial health and growth potential.  Further data is needed.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent News:**  *A comprehensive search for recent news (within the last two days) from reliable sources like Shacknews or FINBOLD is needed to provide up-to-date information on earnings releases and market outlook.*  This section requires a real-time news search which cannot be completed by this AI.  The inclusion of Analyst Opinions and Performance Highlights from recent news reports would greatly enhance the report.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

WFC has shown periods of outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but currently lags.  Recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations. However, the absence of key financial data, and the need for real-time news analysis, significantly limits a conclusive assessment. Technical indicators suggest a short-term uptrend but are approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for short-term correction. The 0.0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term needs more investigation and further context.  Further research into the company's financial statements, industry news, and analyst reports is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
