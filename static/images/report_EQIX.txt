| 2024-10-30 | 3.11 | 2.20 B$       |

There's a slight inconsistency in the data (duplicate entry for Oct 30, 2024). EPS shows some fluctuation, while revenue remains relatively stable.  More detailed analysis requires complete and accurate financial data.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of Total Revenue and Gross Profit data significantly hinders a comprehensive financial analysis. This crucial information is needed to assess the company's profitability and overall financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

EQIX's performance has been mixed relative to the S&P 500, with periods of both outperformance and underperformance.  Technical indicators suggest some near-term caution (RSI approaching overbought), but long-term projections indicate significant potential outperformance.  However, the lack of comprehensive financial data and the significant market sensitivity (high Beta) necessitate a cautious approach. Further analysis with complete financial statements and a deeper understanding of the company's business strategy is required before making any investment decisions.  The provided long-term expected return should be treated with skepticism, as it relies on estimations and past performance is not indicative of future success.
