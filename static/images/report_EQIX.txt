## Equinix Inc. (EQIX) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Equinix Inc. (EQIX) is a global digital infrastructure company, providing data centers and interconnection services.

Over the period analyzed, EQIX's cumulative return (111.07%) lagged behind the S&P 500's return (119.94%) by 8.87 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -8.9% indicates EQIX performed slightly below the S&P 500, falling within the lower 18.9% of its historical performance range relative to the index.  While the alpha is consistently around 0.1, suggesting some outperformance, the beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $908.23
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $919.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $925.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $933.26

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-to-medium term.  The recent slight increase in price (0.16%) from the previous close is minor and doesn't significantly alter this downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (41.25):** Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
* **PPO (-0.13):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-2.1%):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.

The recent price change is not significant enough to warrant labeling it a sharp upward or downward movement.

The expected return of 43.8% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 indicates a potentially high reward, although this is a projection and actual results may vary.
