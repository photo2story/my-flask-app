**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue    |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-04-30 | 3.52 | 2.23 B$    |
| 2024-10-30 | 3.11 | 2.20 B$    |

There's a discrepancy in the data with two entries for 2025-04-30.  Assuming this is an error, EPS and revenue show some growth but are not consistently rising.  Further analysis of this data is needed (e.g., comparing YoY and QoQ growth).

**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data is available. This significantly limits the ability to perform a thorough financial analysis.  Key financial ratios and profitability metrics are missing.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

EQIX has shown a higher cumulative return than the S&P 500, and the expected return is positive. However, the recent price action suggests a potential short-term downward trend. Technical indicators offer a mixed signal, and the absence of crucial financial information hampers a comprehensive assessment.  A more complete dataset, including missing financial data and clarifying the earnings data discrepancy, is necessary for a robust conclusion.  The historical Alpha and Beta data indicate periods of both strong outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  Long-term investors should consider the company's fundamentals and the overall market environment before making investment decisions.
