**7. Overall Analysis:**

EQIX exhibits strong revenue growth and high profit margins, indicating a financially healthy company.

The projected long-term excess return is quite positive but depends on several factors and isn't guaranteed.  Further investigation into the volatility of EPS and ROE, along with a more comprehensive earnings analysis and comparison to industry peers, is necessary for a complete assessment.  The technical indicators are currently neutral.
