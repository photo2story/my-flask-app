* **Latest Quarterly Results Comparison:**  EPS and revenue have fluctuated slightly quarter-over-quarter.

* **Notable Beats or Misses:**  The provided data does not contain information on earnings expectations, so it's impossible to assess whether any of the reported numbers beat or missed expectations.


**5) Financial Information:**

**6) News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions are provided within the given context.  To provide a comprehensive analysis of recent market outlook and analyst opinions, additional information from external sources (financial news websites, analyst reports) is needed.  Similarly, there is no mention of earnings news released within the last two days.


**7) Overall Analysis:**

EQIX has demonstrated stronger performance than the S&P 500 over the given period.  Revenue shows modest growth, and profit margins remain strong. However, EPS and ROE exhibit some volatility, requiring further analysis with a longer time frame and comparison to analyst expectations to fully understand the company's performance.  The limited data provided prevents a complete picture of the company's recent financial health and market outlook.  Additional information, such as analyst ratings, future guidance, and comparison to industry peers, is crucial for a more robust assessment.  The inconsistent data points in the earnings section also hinder a thorough analysis.

* Complete and consistent earnings data.
* Analyst expectations for EPS and revenue for each reported quarter.
