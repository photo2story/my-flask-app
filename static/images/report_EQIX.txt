2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the Equinix (EQIX) data, including analysis and a summary.

**Equinix Inc. (EQIX) Overview:** Equinix is a global data center and colocation services provider, enabling businesses to connect and operate their infrastructure.

**1. Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **EQIX Cumulative Return:** 27.21%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 105.07%
*   **Divergence:** -77.9%
*   **Relative Divergence:** 6.9%

**Analysis:**

*   Equinix has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period covered by the cumulative return data.
*   The -77.9% divergence indicates a large performance gap.
*   The relative divergence of 6.9% suggests the current divergence is near the *low* end of its historical range.  This means the underperformance *could* be at or near a bottom *relative* to its historical fluctuations, but it is *still* a significant underperformance.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2016-2018  | 14.0% | 72.2% | -16.0% | 0.7 | 34.6 |
| 2017-2019  | 52.0% | 72.2% | 10.0% | 0.6 | 57.3 |
| 2018-2020  | 57.0% | 79.3% | 24.0% | 0.8 | 70.1 |
| 2019-2021  | 115.0% | 79.3% | 39.0% | 0.8 | 83.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 11.0% | 82.2% | -8.0% | 0.9 | 64.3 |
| 2021-2023  | 9.0% | 82.2% | -20.0% | 0.9 | 79.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 30.0% | 80.6% | 0.0% | 1.0 | 92.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 4.0% | 82.0% | -64.0% | 0.8 | 75.2 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Varies significantly, showing periods of high growth followed by lower growth.  The recent CAGR is concerningly low.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD values indicate significant potential for losses. These consistently high values demonstrate high risk.
*   **Alpha:**  The alpha is *negative* in several periods (2016-2018, 2020-2022, 2021-2023, 2023-2025), meaning EQIX underperformed relative to what its beta would predict. The recent alpha is *very* negative.
*   **Beta:** The beta ranges from 0.6 to 1.0, indicating that EQIX's price tends to move in the same direction as the market (S&P 500), but potentially with varying degrees of volatility. A beta of 1.0 (in 2022-2024) suggests movement in line with the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** Shows growth, but the recent CAGR and Alpha performance indicate potential problems.

**2. Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 766.16
*   **Previous Close:** 769.71
*   **Change:** -0.46
*   **5-day SMA:** 764.578
*   **20-day SMA:** 751.5395
*   **60-day SMA:** 784.1953

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is slightly below the previous close, indicating a minor decrease.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which can be a short-term bullish signal, but the price is below the 60-day SMA, suggesting a possible longer-term downtrend or consolidation.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 68.66 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.5298
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 2.8 (+) (Short-term increase in divergence)
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a favorable investment environment. However, this seems contradictory to the other negative indicators.
*   The RSI being near 70 suggests the stock *may* be overbought and due for a pullback.
*   The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) indicates the relationship between two moving averages.  A value of 0.5298 suggests the shorter-term moving average is slightly above the longer-term moving average.
*   The "Buy" hybrid signal contradicts the underperformance shown in return rate comparison.
*   The recent increase in divergence, while positive in direction, needs to be considered within the context of the large overall negative divergence.
*   A 0.0% expected return, relative to the S&P 500 over a longer term, is a significant red flag, especially given the "High Investment Recommended" MRI.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Vanderbilt University Buys Shares:** A positive sign, but needs to be weighed against other news.
*   **EQIX Down Since Earnings Report:** Negative. Indicates potential concerns following earnings.
*   **Ditch Digital Realty for Equinix:** Positive, but from a single source (Seeking Alpha).
*   **Exit From Manhattan's Office Landlord:**  Potentially negative, but not directly related to Equinix's core business.  Requires further investigation to determine if it signals broader economic concerns.
*   **Options Market Predicting a Spike:** Could be speculative.  Important to understand the rationale behind the options activity.
*   **Insider Sale:**  A potentially negative signal, as insiders may sell shares when they believe the stock is overvalued or facing challenges.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.66)
*   **Opinions:** 25
*   **Target Price:** 956.28 (Avg), 1200 (High), 785 (Low)

**Analysis:**

*   Analysts are generally positive, with a "Buy" consensus.
*   The average target price suggests significant upside potential.  However, note the wide range between the high and low target prices, indicating uncertainty.
*   The lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess current analyst sentiment.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출     |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- |
| 2025-10-29 | 3.82  | 2.32 B$  |
| 2025-07-30 | 3.76  | 2.26 B$  |
| 2025-04-30 | 3.52  | 2.23 B$  |
| 2024-10-30 | 3.11  | 2.20 B$  |
| 2025-10-29 | 3.11  | 2.20 B$  |

**Analysis:**

*   EPS has been generally increasing, but the final row appears to be a duplicate of an earlier data point (most likely a typo/data error). If we consider the EPS to be increasing and sales to be growing, it is positive.
*   Revenue has also been increasing, which is positive.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2024-12-31 | $13.53B   | -0.10% |
| 2024-09-30 | $13.59B   | 2.19%  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Shows a generally increasing trend.
*   **Profit Margin:** High and relatively stable, indicating good cost control.  The dip in 2024-12-31 warrants further investigation.
*   **Equity:** Growing steadily.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** Positive, indicating that the company is generating profit from shareholder investments. The -0.10% in 2024-12-31 indicates a loss during that period.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Overall, the data presents a mixed picture for Equinix.

*   **Negative Signals:** The most concerning is the *significant underperformance* relative to the S&P 500 and several periods of negative Alpha and the current large negative Alpha. The 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 is also a serious concern. Insider selling and the news about EQIX being down since the last earnings report add to the negative signals.  High MDD values indicate potential for large losses.
*   **Positive Signals:** Analysts generally have a "Buy" rating with a significant upside target. Revenue, EPS, and equity are generally growing. The profit margin is also high.
*   **Neutral/Concerning Mixed Signals:** The "High Investment Recommended" MRI seems questionable, given the other negative signals and is a potentially major red flag as the data appears contradictory. The short-term technical indicators offer conflicting signals.
*   **Recommendation:**  **Caution is advised.** While analysts are bullish, the underperformance, negative Alpha, and insider selling should not be ignored. A 0% expected return compared to S&P 500 (VOO) is a major red flag. Investors should conduct further due diligence to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and the validity of the analyst recommendations. It's essential to understand the reasons for the divergence in analyst opinion, the significant underperformance of the stock vs. the S&P 500, and the recent drop following earnings.
