While recent positive developments might suggest a potential turnaround, the long-term underperformance and high volatility cannot be ignored. Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before making any decisions. The current "Buy" hybrid signal might be based on short-term factors, so it's essential to consider the broader context.
