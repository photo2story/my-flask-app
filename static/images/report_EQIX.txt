## Equinix Inc (EQIX) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Equinix Inc. is a global digital infrastructure company providing data centers and interconnection services.  Recent performance shows underperformance relative to the S&P 500, with indications of a potential buying opportunity based on several valuation metrics. However, further investigation is warranted.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Equinix (EQIX) shows a cumulative return of 64.85% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 71.02%. This results in a current negative divergence of -6.2%, placing it at the 38.1st percentile of its historical range (-40.6% to 49.8%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results. While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies significantly year-over-year, indicating volatility, the Beta generally hovers around 0.9-1.0 suggesting a similar volatility to the overall market.  Alphas are generally positive, indicating some degree of outperformance, though inconsistently.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) consistently increases throughout the period.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 46.0% | 54.9% | 17.0% | 0.0 | 38.5 |
| 2016-2018  | -13.0% | 64.3% | -30.0% | 0.0 | 30.6 |
| 2017-2019  | 29.0% | 64.3% | 0.0% | 1.1 | 51.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 31.0% | 64.3% | 2.0% | 0.4 | 64.2 |
| 2019-2021  | 82.0% | 60.0% | 8.0% | 0.3 | 77.3 |
| 2020-2022  | 3.0% | 67.7% | -18.0% | 0.3 | 61.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -5.0% | 67.7% | -33.0% | 0.9 | 76.4 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $766.21
* 5-Day Moving Average: $806.30
* 20-Day Moving Average: $830.91
* 60-Day Moving Average: $886.87

The price is significantly below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price change (-4.4%) indicates a relatively sharp decline from the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.4693 (High Risk category)
* RSI: 28.53 (Oversold territory)
* PPO: -0.43 (Bearish signal)
* 20-Day Relative Divergence Change: +16.5 (Short-term upward momentum)
* Expected Return: -13.9% (This indicates significant underperformance relative to expectations at the current moment).  A long-term (2+ years) investment may see an improvement relative to this,  but currently lacks data to quantify this potential against the S&P 500.

The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and a negative expected return, coupled with the high MRI, suggests caution.  The recent price drop should be analyzed further for underlying causes.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue, without a clear upward trend.  The duplicate entry for 2024-10-30 requires clarification.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 3.11  | $2.20B      |
| 2024-08-07 | 3.17  | $2.16B      |
| 2024-05-08 | 2.44  | $2.13B      |
| 2023-10-27 | 2.94  | $2.06B      |
| 2024-10-30 | 2.94  | $2.06B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue shows a slight upward trend, while profit margins are relatively stable and high.  ROE fluctuates but shows profitability in most quarters.  The negative ROE in 2024-12-31 is concerning and requires further investigation.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.26B | 47.10% |

| 2024-12-31 | $13.53B  | -0.10%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $13.59B  | 2.19%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $12.28B  | 2.45%   |

| 2023-12-31 | $12.49B  | 1.82%   |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

EQIX is currently underperforming the S&P 500, showing signs of a possible oversold condition based on technical indicators. However, several factors warrant caution:  a high market risk indicator, a negative expected return, and a recent significant price drop.  The inconsistent Alpha and fluctuating ROE also raise questions. Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and the negative ROE in Q4 2024 are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data provided is insufficient to confidently predict long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500, despite some periods of positive alpha.  More detailed fundamental analysis is recommended.
