*   **Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals some key trends:
    *   **CAGR & MDD:** While there were periods of strong growth (e.g., 2015-2017, 2019-2021), more recent periods (2020-2025) show negative CAGR, coupled with significant Maximum Drawdown (MDD), indicating increased risk and volatility.

    *   **Beta:** The Beta has increased significantly in recent years, indicating that EQIX is becoming more correlated with the market (S&P 500) and its price swings are amplified compared to the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 763.30
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 765.0, 'previousClose': 763.3, 'change': 0.22}
*   **Simple Moving Averages (SMAs):**

    *   20-day SMA: 747.07
    *   60-day SMA: 784.43

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is above both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it's below the 60-day SMA, indicating a possible longer-term downward trend or consolidation. The small change between the previous close and the last market price suggests limited immediate volatility.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 62.96
*   **PPO:** 0.5444
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 1.2 (+) (단기상승 - Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -283.1%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:**  While seemingly contradictory with the other metrics, a high MRI can indicate a potentially undervalued asset, though it should be considered cautiously in light of other factors.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 62.96 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating neutral momentum.
    *   **PPO:** A positive PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, supporting the short-term upward trend indicated by the SMAs.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is recommending 100% cash allocation, implying a cautious outlook based on the integrated analysis.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The short-term increase in relative divergence suggests a potential bounce or short-term recovery.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. This suggests that, based on the model used, EQIX is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term if purchased at this point.
