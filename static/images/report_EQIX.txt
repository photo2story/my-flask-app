This report analyzes Equinix Inc. (EQIX), a global digital infrastructure company providing data centers and interconnection services, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Equinix's cumulative return (125.25%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.91%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 4.3%, placing it at the 30.7th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This suggests a relatively strong outperformance, though the range of historical differences is wide.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $965.0
* **5-day Moving Average:** $968.91
* **20-day Moving Average:** $955.97
* **60-day Moving Average:** $909.39

The price is currently below the 5-day moving average, suggesting some short-term bearish pressure. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a generally positive longer-term trend.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price (964.74) is negligible and does not indicate a significant rapid price movement (up or down).

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.89 –  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral momentum.
* **PPO:** -0.22 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -3.1% – This indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 19.9% – This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with consistent investment.

The combination of indicators shows mixed signals. While the long-term outlook appears positive based on expected returns, the short-term technicals indicate a slight bearish bias.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally grown slightly quarter over quarter, though it showed some minor fluctuations.
* **EPS:** EPS shows some fluctuation, with a dip in Q1 2024, followed by a slight increase in Q2 and a further increase in Q3 2024.  There's a duplicate entry for Q3 2024; it is unclear if this is an error in the data or a different reporting.
* **Notable Beats/Misses:**  Without expected values, it's impossible to determine whether the reported earnings represented a beat or miss.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows consistent, modest growth over the past five quarters. Profit margins have also shown a generally upward trend, indicating strong profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown some fluctuations, while ROE has been relatively inconsistent across the quarters, mostly remaining above 2%, indicative of above average return on investment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Equinix (EQIX) shows a strong long-term performance relative to the S&P 500.  While short-term technical indicators show some weakness, the long-term expected return is significant, supported by generally increasing revenue and profit margins.  The financial data is indicative of a healthy company.  More information is needed on current market conditions and analyst opinions to fully assess the current risk and reward profile.  The lack of information on earnings expectations prevents a complete analysis of recent earnings' performance.  The duplicate Q3 2024 data point requires clarification.
