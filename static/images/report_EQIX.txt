* **5-Day Moving Average:** 900.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 897.5
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 871.24

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a minor short-term pullback.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.65 (Slightly below neutral; not significantly oversold or overbought)

**8. Overall Summary:**

EQIX has demonstrated strong long-term growth, outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent performance shows some signs of slowing down, with slightly declining profit margins and inconsistent EPS.
