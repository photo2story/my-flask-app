| 2023-2025 | -6.0% | 81.7% | -74.0%  | 1.1   | 75.0   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows inconsistent performance with periods of strong growth followed by declines.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD values indicate significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Predominantly negative Alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market, indicating that EQIX has not generated excess returns compared to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500) considering the risk (beta).
*   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuate, but more recent periods show higher Beta (above 1) suggesting EQIX's price is more volatile than the market. A negative Beta is not normal, but when it is near zero or zero, it means it is uncorrelated with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** The company's capitalization is consistently at a large amount.

*   **5-day SMA:** 759.72
*   **20-day SMA:** 747.07
*   **60-day SMA:** 784.43

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is above the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend.
*   However, the price is below the 60-day SMA, indicating a possible longer-term downtrend or consolidation.
*   The last-market data shows a slight increase, confirming the recent upward momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 62.96 (Near overbought territory, but not yet extreme)
*   **PPO:** 0.54 (Positive, indicating a possible upward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 1.2 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -283.1 (Very negative expected return)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, which may conflict with other indicators. (Keep in mind that this MRI may have been calculated with incomplete and inaccurate information.)
*   The RSI is approaching overbought conditions.
*   The PPO indicates possible upward momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, but this seems contradictory given the large negative Expected Return.
*   The negative Expected Return is a significant concern and suggests a pessimistic outlook for long-term investment in EQIX relative to the S&P 500.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Concerns:** Recent share price pullback, negative Expected Return, some institutional selling, and potentially overbought RSI.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Generally positive, with a "Buy" consensus.

**Conclusion:**

EQIX appears to be a company with strong fundamentals and potential growth drivers, particularly in the AI data center space. However, recent underperformance and negative expected returns compared to S&P 500, coupled with high volatility, suggest that it may not be the most attractive investment relative to the overall market at this time. The analyst ratings and news suggest a possible rebound, but careful consideration of the risks and potential rewards is warranted. The negative expected return is a significant red flag. The positive MRI may be misleading if it's not accounting for specific company risks. Consider investigating the reasons behind the underperformance and negative expected return before investing. It is possible that the analyst opinions are not reflecting the underlying market conditions.
