**6. Overall Analysis:**

EQIX exhibits strong revenue and profit margins, suggesting a fundamentally sound business.  However, recent performance has lagged the S&P 500, indicated by negative price momentum, and low RSI.  The high expected return suggests long-term potential, but the high beta indicates significant market risk.  Further investigation is needed to reconcile the inconsistent EPS data and to better understand the fluctuations in ROE. The relatively high beta suggests that investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing.  Additional data and deeper fundamental analysis would enhance the accuracy of the conclusions.
