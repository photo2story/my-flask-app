| 2023-2025  | -5.0%  | 81.7%  | -72.0%  | 1.1    | 75.6   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows a declining trend in recent periods, with negative growth in the last several years.
*   **MDD:**  Maximum Drawdown is high, consistently above 65%, indicating significant potential for losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently negative in recent years, suggesting that the stock is underperforming relative to its benchmark (risk-adjusted).  The most recent period shows a very large negative Alpha.
*   **Beta:** Beta has fluctuated, but is consistently elevated in recent periods, suggesting higher volatility than the market and increased sensitivity to market movements. This means that EQIX's price tends to move more than the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Represents the market capitalization in billions, showing an overall increasing trend, but has recently decreased.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 769.71
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 769.71, 'previousClose': 765.0, 'change': 0.62}
*   **5-day SMA:** 763.37
*   **20-day SMA:** 749.68
*   **60-day SMA:** 784.15

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, but below the 60-day SMA. This *could* suggest a potential short-term upward trend, but longer-term may indicate some consolidation and potentially further downside. The very recent price change is slightly positive, but it alone is not sufficient to derive any useful information.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 66.53
*   **PPO:** 0.57
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -392.5

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI suggests that, based on the model, the current market conditions present a favorable investment environment (high recommended). This should be treated with caution and weighed against other indicators, especially considering the company-specific challenges identified elsewhere.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 66.53 suggests that the stock is approaching overbought conditions, but is not there yet.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average, which can be a bullish signal, but the magnitude is small.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying, but the fact that it is classified as "Very Safe" might be misleading considering the other negative indicators. The reliability of the model should be verified.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Indicates a short-term downward trend relative to the comparison.
*   **Expected Return:** A *very* negative expected return (-392.5%) is a major red flag. This suggests the model projects substantial underperformance over the long term, relative to the S&P 500. This might be an artifact of the model or specific to the current data provided.

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed. There are positive elements like the end of the SEC probe and a raised price target from BMO Capital, as well as the AI Supercomputer deal. However, there are also negative signals like decreased stock holdings by Swedbank, an article explaining a price drop after earnings, analysis focusing on "price-sensitive allocations," and an insider sale. The mixed news provides no clear direction of the stock.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.66)
*   **Opinions:** 25
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 956.28 / 1200.00 / 785.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent changes data.

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is "Buy" with a significant number of opinions. The average target price is significantly higher than the current price (769.71), suggesting potential upside. However, it's important to note the low target is closer to the current price, indicating a range of opinions.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue   |
|------------|-------|-----------|

| 2025-10-29 | 3.11  | 2.20 B$   |

**Analysis:**

Both EPS (Earnings Per Share) and Revenue show a generally increasing trend, which is a positive sign. However, the revenue growth appears to be slowing. The last two rows are the same, which is probably an error and needs to be reviewed.

Based on the provided information, a cautious approach to investing in EQIX is warranted. While analyst ratings are positive and financial metrics show growth, the underperformance relative to the market, the negative alpha, the insider sale, and the concerning expected return cannot be ignored. Further investigation is needed to understand the factors driving the negative expected return and the reasons for the underperformance. The MRI suggests the market recommends investment; however, the hybrid signal, earnings, financial information, return rate, and recent news suggests a cautious approach.
