**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 83.34 –  This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.

More information is needed regarding recent market sentiment, analyst opinions, and a comparison of actual earnings to expectations to provide a more comprehensive assessment.  The lack of information about news events within the last two days limits the analysis.
