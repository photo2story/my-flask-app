**7. Overall Analysis & Summary**

EQIX has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, but there are some positive signs.

The recent news suggests that EQIX is currently subject to market volatility and scrutiny, so it's important to monitor company announcements and news closely.

**In conclusion, EQIX presents a mixed picture.  The underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and high MDD must be considered with a long-term perspective with high expected return. Given the recent news and market volatility, caution is advised, but the strong revenue and earnings growth, along with potential for high future growth, make it a potentially attractive investment for a long-term horizon.**
