* **20-Day Moving Average:** $791.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $859.85

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The recent price increase from the previous close ($791.12 to $809.46) is a notable, relatively sharp increase.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.84 (Slightly below neutral; not significantly oversold)

The combination of a moderately positive PPO and a slightly below-neutral RSI suggests mixed signals. The relatively high expected return is a positive factor, but potential risks should still be considered.  The recent sharp price increase should be further analyzed for sustainability.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue. Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying trends and drivers of this variability.  A more detailed analysis would involve comparing these figures to previous years and industry benchmarks to assess growth and profitability.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-30 | 3.11 | 2.20 B$ |
| 2024-08-07 | 3.17 | 2.16 B$ |

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals relatively stable revenue and high profit margins. However, the ROE fluctuates and even shows a negative value in the latest quarter, warranting further investigation into the factors driving this volatility.  More comprehensive analysis would include comparing these figures to industry averages and past performance.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.26B | 47.10% |

| 2024-03-31 | $2.13B | 48.71% |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.11B | 48.27% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

EQIX has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn.  While the expected long-term return is positive, the fluctuating alpha and beta, along with the mixed technical indicators and some inconsistencies in the financial data (especially the negative ROE and duplicated earnings data), warrant a more thorough due diligence process before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the causes of the ROE fluctuation and the apparent duplication in the earnings data is crucial.  Comparing these figures to industry benchmarks and analyzing future growth projections will provide a more comprehensive picture of the investment opportunity.
