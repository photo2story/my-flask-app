EQIX demonstrates strong revenue and profit margins, indicating a healthy financial position. However, the stock's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term rebound, but the negative PPO and price position below moving averages indicate caution.  The high projected long-term return needs further investigation regarding the methodology used to arrive at this estimate.  Further analysis should include debt levels, cash flow, and a more detailed competitive analysis to provide a comprehensive assessment. The data provided contains inconsistencies and errors which need to be rectified before confident conclusions can be drawn.
