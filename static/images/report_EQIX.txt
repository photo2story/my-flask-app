**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue has generally increased, EPS has shown some decrease.  There's also a duplicate entry for 2024-10-30.  Further investigation is needed to clarify the data and analyze trends effectively.  A consistent trend analysis requires cleaning of the duplicated data point.

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출        |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 3.11 | $2.20 B     |

**6.  Overall Analysis:**

EQIX shows a mixed performance picture. While revenue and profit margins are healthy, recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  The inconsistent alpha and beta values highlight the volatility and market sensitivity of the stock.  Technical indicators offer a slightly more optimistic short-term outlook, with the RSI suggesting potential oversold conditions.  The projected long-term expected return is promising but requires further analysis to validate the forecast.  Inconsistencies and duplicated data in the earnings report need clarification.  A more comprehensive analysis requires additional data, a review of the company's strategic direction and detailed financial modeling.  The negative ROE in the latest quarter is a key concern that requires deeper investigation.
