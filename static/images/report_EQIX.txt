EQIX shows long-term growth potential supported by a high expected return. However, recent performance lags the S&P 500, and short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend.

Investors should carefully consider the risk associated with the stock's volatility and the need for further investigation of data inconsistencies before making any investment decisions.  A long-term perspective, however, may be warranted given the predicted long-term outperformance of the S&P 500.
