**6. Overall Analysis:**

EQIX shows strong long-term growth potential, indicated by historical CAGR and projected long-term returns. However, recent performance has lagged the S&P 500, and current technical indicators suggest bearish momentum. While revenue and profitability remain strong, inconsistent ROE and recent price action warrant further investigation before making investment decisions.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the fluctuating ROE is necessary.  Considering the expected long-term outperformance, a long-term investment strategy might be considered, but with a cautious approach given the current market sentiment and short-term indicators.  Additional research into industry trends and competitive landscape would enhance the analysis.
