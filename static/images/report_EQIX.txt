EQIX shows strong long-term growth potential, outperforming the S&P 500.  Recent price action suggests a short-term bullish trend, supported by positive technical indicators.  However, the medium risk level (MRI) and fluctuations in profitability metrics warrant caution.  A long-term investment strategy, considering the expected return of 12.2%, seems reasonable, but ongoing monitoring of financial statements and market conditions is crucial.  The duplicated data entry in the earnings report requires clarification.  Further research into the drivers of earnings fluctuations and a more detailed risk assessment is recommended before making any investment decisions.
