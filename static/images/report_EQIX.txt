**8. Overall Analysis:**

EQIX has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a cumulative return significantly higher than the benchmark.

A long-term investment outlook (2+ years), as suggested by the provided expected return of 1.73% over the S&P 500, might be favorable considering its historical outperformance and the potential for future growth in the data center industry. However,  a more comprehensive analysis, incorporating all missing information, is necessary before reaching a definitive conclusion.
