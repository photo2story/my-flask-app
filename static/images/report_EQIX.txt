2025-12-06 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Equinix (EQIX) based on the provided data, broken down into sections as requested:

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **EQIX Overview:** Equinix, Inc. is a global interconnection and data center company.

*   **Return Rate Numbers:**
    *   EQIX Cumulative Return: 28.35%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 100.58%
    *   Divergence: -69.8% (Relative Divergence: 0.0)

*   **Return Rate Analysis:** Equinix has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The -69.8% divergence highlights this substantial difference. The relative divergence of 0.0 indicates this performance is at the very bottom of its historical fluctuation range compared to the S&P 500. This could be a cause for concern but could also signal a potential buying opportunity if the fundamentals of the company are still strong and the underperformance is considered temporary.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 37.0% | 65.9% | 8.0% | 0.0 | 45.0 |
| 2016-2018  | -11.0% | 71.8% | -26.0% | -0.0 | 35.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 17.0% | 71.8% | -5.0% | -0.2 | 58.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 24.0% | 78.9% | 0.0% | -0.1 | 71.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 74.0% | 78.9% | 27.0% | 0.2 | 84.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -4.0% | 79.9% | -3.0% | 1.4 | 65.1 |
| 2021-2023  | -22.0% | 80.2% | -23.0% | 2.0 | 80.0 |
| 2022-2024  | -6.0% | 80.2% | -26.0% | 2.1 | 93.7 |
| 2023-2025  | -11.0% | 81.7% | -76.0% | 1.1 | 72.8 |

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** Fluctuating, with strong positive periods (2015-2017, 2019-2021) offset by recent negative performance.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.  MDD has generally been increasing over time.
    *   **Alpha:**  Predominantly negative, meaning Equinix has generally underperformed its benchmark (the market) on a risk-adjusted basis, especially recently. The sharp negative Alpha in 2023-2025 is particularly concerning.
    *   **Beta:** Increasing over time and trending above 1, indicating that the stock is becoming more sensitive to market movements.  The high beta values in recent years suggest that EQIX's price swings are amplified compared to the overall market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Price Data:**
    *   Close: 732.72
    *   Last Market: Price = 741.58, Previous Close = 726.09, Change = 2.13
    *   5-day SMA: 738.91
    *   20-day SMA: 776.63
    *   60-day SMA: 793.81

*   **Price Fluctuation Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a downtrend. The recent price increase in the last market data could be a sign of short-term rebound, but it needs to be observed if this trend can be sustained.

**3) RSI, PPO & Expected Return Analysis**

*   **Indicators:**
    *   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
    *   RSI: 16.05 (Oversold)
    *   PPO: -0.67
    *   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
    *   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -4.0 (Short-term Decline)
    *   Expected Return: -1745.7%

*   **Indicator Analysis:**
    *   **RSI:** The RSI of 16.05 indicates that the stock is heavily oversold, which *could* suggest a potential for a bounce back.
    *   **PPO:** The negative PPO confirms the downtrend, but the magnitude is not extreme.
    *   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium investment recommendation based on the market conditions.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests to invest fully now.
    *   **Relative Divergence Change:** The -4.0 change in relative divergence confirms short-term downward momentum.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-1745.7%) is highly concerning and suggests the model predicts significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. *This should be investigated further; such a large negative value is unusual and might indicate an error in the calculation or a very specific, negative outlook from the model.*

    *   Key: Buy
    *   Mean: 1.59 (~Buy)
    *   Opinions: 25

*   **Analyst Opinion Analysis:**
    *   The analyst consensus is "Buy" with a mean rating of 1.59, indicating overall positive sentiment.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

*   **Earnings Table:**

| 날짜         | EPS  | 매출    |
|--------------|------|---------|
| 2025-10-29   | 3.82 | 2.32 B$ |
| 2025-07-30   | 3.76 | 2.26 B$ |
| 2025-04-30   | 3.52 | 2.23 B$ |
| 2024-10-30   | 3.11 | 2.20 B$ |
| 2025-10-29   | 3.11 | 2.20 B$ |

*   **Earnings Analysis:**  Both EPS and revenue have generally been increasing. The trend suggests positive growth, but the duplicated date (2025-10-29) with different values need verification. If there is an error, the growth rates from 2024-10-30 to 2025-10-29 is stronger than expected.

**6) Financial Information**

*   **Revenue and Profitability Table:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $2.32B  | 50.69%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $2.26B  | 51.95%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $2.23B  | 51.28%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $2.26B  | 47.10%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $2.20B  | 50.11%        |

*   **Revenue and Profitability Analysis:** Revenue shows a positive trend. Profit margins are strong (above 50% in most recent quarters) but slightly fluctuating, suggesting some potential cost pressures. The dip in profit margin for 2024-12-31 should be investigated further.

*   **Capital and Profitability Table:**

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE   |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| 2025-09-30   | $14.16B  | 2.64% |
| 2025-06-30   | $14.08B  | 2.61% |
| 2025-03-31   | $13.89B  | 2.47% |
| 2024-12-31   | $13.53B  | -0.10% |
| 2024-09-30   | $13.59B  | 2.19% |

*   **Capital and Profitability Analysis:** Equity is increasing, showing the company's net worth is growing. ROE is positive in general, but is around 2-3% for most quarters, implying this metric should be watched and investigated more closely. The significant ROE decline in the 2024-12-31 needs to be looked into, which can mean this quarter had a significant loss that dragged the yearly performance down.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Equinix presents a mixed picture. While the company operates in a growing sector (data centers, especially with the rise of AI), and analysts have a positive outlook (Buy consensus, high price targets), there are several concerning factors:

*   **Significant Underperformance:**  EQIX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Negative Alpha:** Indicates the stock has underperformed on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Increasing Beta:**  The stock is becoming more volatile relative to the market.
*   **Downtrend:** Price is below key moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.
*   **Oversold Conditions:** The RSI indicates oversold conditions, which *could* lead to a rebound.
*   **Mixed News:** News items point to valuation concerns, institutional selling, and leadership changes, offset by some positive analyst sentiment and the overall growth in data centers.
*   **High MDD:** High maximum drawdowns indicate significant risk.
*   **Revenue and EPS growth:** Suggests positive performance.
*   **Profit Margin & ROE should be investigated further:** Recent fluctuation should be watched.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** The most concerning factor. This requires a thorough investigation to understand the model's assumptions and whether the number is accurate.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, Equinix appears to be a **high-risk, potentially high-reward investment**. The strong analyst consensus and the company's position in the growing data center market are positives. However, the underperformance, negative alpha, high volatility, and especially the extremely negative expected return are significant red flags.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Further Investigation is Crucial:** Before making any investment decision, the negative expected return *must* be thoroughly investigated.  Understand the assumptions driving this projection.
*   **Monitor Key Metrics:** Closely monitor the company's financial performance (revenue growth, profit margins, ROE), analyst ratings, and any further news related to the company.
*   **Consider Risk Tolerance:** Given the volatility and potential for further downside, only investors with a high risk tolerance should consider investing in Equinix, and even then, only after a thorough due diligence process.
