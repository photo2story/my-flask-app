## Equinix Inc. (EQIX) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Equinix Inc. is a global digital infrastructure company that provides data center and interconnection services.  The company's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons for this underperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **EQIX Cumulative Return:** 111.72%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 117.48%
* **Return Difference:** -5.76%  (EQIX underperformed VOO by 5.76% at the end of the period).
* **Relative Divergence:** 21.7% (indicates EQIX's underperformance is within the lower 21.7% of its historical range relative to VOO).  This suggests that the current underperformance is not exceptionally unusual compared to past variations.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods.  While some periods exhibit positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others show negative alpha.  The beta consistently indicates high market sensitivity (above 1), meaning EQIX's price tends to move more than the market's.  The high beta is typical of a growth stock.  The significant volatility in both alpha and beta suggests considerable risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $915.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $913.17
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $921.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $934.45

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent slight increase (0.15%) indicates minor upward momentum, but the overall trend seems bearish.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.36 (slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.0165 (negative, suggesting a weak bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.7 (indicates short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 36.3% (above S&P 500 over 2+ years)

Despite the slightly positive short-term momentum (indicated by the relative divergence), the negative PPO suggests a weak bearish trend.  The expected return is positive, suggesting potential for long-term growth, but this is dependent on market conditions.  The small daily price increase doesn't signify a significant rebound or decline.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  EPS and revenue have generally increased, although there are slight fluctuations quarter-to-quarter.  More detailed analysis, including revenue growth rate, would be needed to assess the health of the company's business. Note the duplicate entry for 2024-10-30.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

EQIX shows strong revenue and profit margins, suggesting a fundamentally sound business. However, its recent performance has underperformed the S&P 500, and the stock price shows some bearish signals.  The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  While the long-term expected return is positive, investors should consider the volatility and market risk associated with this stock.  Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the fluctuating ROE is recommended before making investment decisions.  The data provided is limited and lacks some crucial elements for a comprehensive evaluation (e.g., debt levels, future growth projections).
