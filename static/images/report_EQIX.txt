**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Equinix Inc. (EQIX) is a global digital infrastructure company, offering data centers and interconnection services.  Over the analyzed period, EQIX underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by a relatively small margin (-1.03% difference in cumulative return).

While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others reveal negative alpha.  Beta values fluctuate but generally indicate higher volatility than the market.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

EQIX shows a mixed performance. While long-term expected returns are positive relative to the S&P 500, recent performance has lagged slightly.  The high market risk indicator and negative PPO signal caution. However, the approaching oversold RSI and recent price surge suggest a potential short-term upward trend. A thorough analysis of the fluctuating EPS and the negative ROE in the most recent quarter is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the causes of the recent price jump is also necessary for a complete picture.  The long-term outlook remains positive, but careful monitoring of key financial metrics is recommended.
