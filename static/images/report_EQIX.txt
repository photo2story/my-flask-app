*   Recent Debt offering.

**Positive Signals:**

*   Analyst consensus remains "Buy" with substantial upside target prices.

**Conclusion:**

The technical indicators and relative performance suggest caution. While analysts remain bullish and the company demonstrates good profit margins, the underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the extremely negative "Expected Return" are significant concerns.

The recent price action and oversold conditions *could* present a contrarian buying opportunity, especially if the analyst target prices prove accurate. However, the high beta and negative alpha suggest increased risk. Further research is needed to understand the reason for the poor relative performance and the negative "Expected Return" before making any investment decisions.
