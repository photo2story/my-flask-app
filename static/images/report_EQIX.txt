* **Closing Price:** $776.83
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $766.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $812.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $875.33

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The price is also slightly up from the previous close, indicating a minor positive daily change.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.44 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound)
* **PPO:** -0.27 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -13.0% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 12.1% over the long term (2+ years) with a longer term investment strategy

The combination of a high MRI, oversold RSI, and negative PPO indicates a mixed signal. While the RSI suggests potential for a rebound, the negative PPO and high MRI warn of continued bearish momentum and market risk.  The recent price increase of $0.79 does not represent a significant change and does not necessarily negate the negative indicators.

The long-term expected return is positive relative to the S&P 500.

A comprehensive investment decision requires careful consideration of the company's fundamentals, the current market conditions, and the investor's risk tolerance.  The data suggests that while EQIX offers potential long-term growth, the current market conditions suggest caution.  Investors should closely monitor market trends and the company's performance before making any investment decisions.
