**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuates significantly, showing high growth periods (e.g., 2019-2021) and periods of negative growth (e.g., 2016-2018, 2021-2023, 2023-2025).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values indicate substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is inconsistent, sometimes positive, sometimes negative, indicating the company's ability to outperform or underperform relative to a benchmark varies considerably.  The recent negative Alpha values are concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta generally low, indicating low correlation with the market, but is increasing in recent periods.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization generally increases over time, indicating overall growth in company size.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** 788.61
*   **Previous Close:** 797.48
*   **Change:** -1.11
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 782.348
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 778.0315
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 787.7282

**Analysis:** The stock price has decreased slightly in the most recent session. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day moving average, which is below the 60-day moving average. This mixed signal suggests short-term upward momentum but potential resistance at the 60-day moving average. The change of -1.11 doesn't appear to be a major issue, but it contributes to the overall picture.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3233 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 50.97
*   **PPO:** 0.3264
*   **Hybrid Signal:** `cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-02)`
*   **Recent (20-Day) Relative Deviation Change:** 2.1 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 549.4 (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests **low market risk** at the moment.
*   RSI around 50 indicates a neutral condition, neither overbought nor oversold.
*   PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) indicates a slightly positive trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a cautiously optimistic approach, recommending buying a portion of available cash and a monthly investment. The MRI value included with this signal further emphasizes caution, as it's nearing the medium risk threshold.
*   The increase in recent relative deviation suggests short-term upward momentum compared to the S&P 500, although it is still underperforming it.
*   The high expected return (549.4%) suggests a very optimistic long-term outlook compared to the S&P 500, but should be tempered with consideration of the high volatility (MDD) and inconsistent Alpha.
*   The `change` of -1.11 in the `Last-market` data doesn't represent a major event (no sharp rebound or fall).

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **[2025-09-11] Applied Digital Jumps 122% Year to Date:**  This news is irrelevant to EQIX.
*   **[2025-09-10] Flexential Hires Greg Ogle as CIO:**  May indicate increasing competition or strategic shifts in the data center/cloud space.
*   **[2025-09-10] Global Data Centre & Cloud Expo Canada 2025:**  Indicates ongoing activity and innovation in the sector, potentially creating opportunities and challenges.
*   **[2025-09-08] Equinix (EQIX) Stock Falls Amid Market Uptick:** This is concerning as it suggests EQIX is underperforming even when the broader market is rising.
*   **[2025-09-08] Startup Central Expands Engineering Team:** Irrelevant to EQIX.
*   **[2025-09-08] Equinix Stock: Is EQIX Underperforming the Real Estate Sector?:** Reinforces the underperformance narrative.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. While the sector is active and innovative, recent news specifically about Equinix highlights underperformance relative to the market and the real estate sector.

#### 4.2 Analyst Opinions

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.68 (~Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 24
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 958.33 / 1200.00 / 804.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes are indicated ( →  ()).

**Analysis:**  Analysts generally have a positive outlook on the stock, with a consensus rating of "Buy" and a substantial average target price above the current price. However, the lack of recent rating changes suggests that analysts haven't significantly updated their views recently, so the recent underperformance might not be fully reflected in these ratings yet.
