**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Roku's stock performance has been lagging behind the S&P 500, but it has shown signs of recent price momentum. The stock is currently in overbought territory according to the RSI, and the recent earnings report missed analyst expectations for EPS. However, the revenue beat expectations and the positive PPO value suggests some bullish momentum. 

**6. Conclusion:**

While Roku's recent earnings report was mixed and the stock is currently overbought, its positive price action and relatively high PPO value suggest potential for further upside. However, investors should keep an eye on the relative divergence, which may indicate a short-term downward trend, and monitor earnings reports closely to assess the company's future growth trajectory.
