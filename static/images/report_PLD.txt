* **Closing Price:** 116.40
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 116.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 115.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 120.13

The price is currently trading slightly below its 5-day moving average and 20-day moving average, but above the last market close (115.14). It is significantly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a downward trend in recent months.

* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** nan (-), indicating a recent downward trend.
  Given that the last market close (115.14) is lower than the current price (116.40), there was likely a small recent price increase.  The term "nan" for the relative strength change suggests data is missing.
