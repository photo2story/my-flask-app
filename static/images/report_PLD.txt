| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 50.0% | 57.6% | 0.1 | 49.2 |
| 2016-2018  | 36.0% | 64.4% | 0.1 | 46.1 |
| 2017-2019  | 72.0% | 64.4% | 0.3 | 71.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 57.0% | 64.4% | 0.3 | 82.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 167.0% | 15.7% | 107.0% | 0.3 | 142.1 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $102.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $99.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $103.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $113.21

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  However, the recent price increase of $1.80 (1.8%) from the previous close indicates a potential short-term bullish reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.54 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** 0.235 (Positive, but relatively low)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +6.8% (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** 150.3% (A high expected return; this number requires validation/clarification on its calculation method and underlying assumptions)

The relatively low RSI and positive PPO suggest a potential for further price increases.  The 1.8% daily price increase needs further investigation to determine if it signals a sustained uptrend or is merely a temporary bounce.  The high expected return requires further scrutiny of the methodology used.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows inconsistencies (duplicate entries for 2025-02-14).  Assuming the duplicates are errors, the data suggests a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue.  More consistent data is needed for a more reliable analysis.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue     |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2025-02-14 | 1.38 | $2.20 B     |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | $2.04 B     |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.93 | $2.01 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows consistent growth in revenue and relatively stable profit margins.  However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is relatively low, indicating potential areas for improvement in capital efficiency.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.20B | 76.39% |
| 2024-09-30 | $2.04B | 76.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.01B | 74.31% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.96B | 72.76% |
| 2023-12-31 | $1.89B | 74.22% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $53.95B | 2.37% |
| 2024-09-30 | $53.07B | 1.90% |
| 2024-06-30 | $53.35B | 1.61% |
| 2024-03-31 | $53.19B | 1.10% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the given period, demonstrating strong alpha. While recent price action shows a slight downturn, the company's financial performance and long-term outlook, as suggested by the expected return, remain positive.  However, the provided data has some inconsistencies (duplicate earnings data) and requires further validation (especially the high expected return of 150.3%).  A more comprehensive analysis would require additional information, including a detailed breakdown of the expected return calculation, a more complete and consistent earnings history, and an assessment of the current macroeconomic environment and its potential impact on the real estate market.  The relatively low ROE suggests potential areas for improvement in capital efficiency.  The data suggests a relatively medium risk profile (MRI).  Short-term price movements might be influenced by market sentiment, so a long-term perspective is recommended for investment decisions.
