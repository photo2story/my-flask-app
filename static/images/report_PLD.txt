## Prologis Inc. (PLD) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

PLD, Prologis Inc., is a global real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in logistics and industrial properties.  The following analysis is based on the provided data.  Note that some data inconsistencies (e.g., duplicate entries in the earnings data) were observed and handled as best possible within the limitations of the provided information.

**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **PLD Cumulative Return:** 93.71%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 118.31%
* **Return Difference:** -24.6%  PLD underperformed VOO by 24.6% over the analyzed period. The relative divergence (-24.6) sits at the 15th percentile of the historical range (-51.8 to 129.3), suggesting the underperformance is not entirely unusual given the historical volatility.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and beta (volatility relative to the market). While some periods show strong alpha (e.g., 2019-2021), others demonstrate negative returns and high volatility (2022-2025), likely due to broader market factors and possibly specific industry shifts.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) also increased significantly during the period of high alpha, implying the company's expansion during that time.  The dramatic drop in CAGR (2022-2025) is concerning and needs further investigation.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 40.0% | 4.4% | 12.0% | 0.1 | 49.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 27.0% | 10.9% | 9.0% | 0.2 | 46.5 |
| 2017-2019  | 64.0% | 10.9% | 33.0% | 0.5 | 72.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 45.0% | 10.9% | 18.0% | 0.3 | 83.2 |
| 2019-2021  | 154.0% | 8.4% | 83.0% | 0.3 | 143.3 |
| 2020-2022  | 6.0% | 20.1% | -2.0% | 0.3 | 98.4 |
| 2021-2023  | 25.0% | 20.1% | 1.0% | 0.8 | 119.7 |
| 2022-2024  | -106.0% | 21.3% | -139.0% | 0.8 | 98.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $120.97
* **5-day Moving Average:** $121.13
* **20-day Moving Average:** $119.89
* **60-day Moving Average:** $113.12

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some near-term weakness.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.  The recent price change of +$0.07 (0.057%) is not significant enough to be categorized as a sharp move up or down.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 56.64 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.17 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.0 (Short-term upward trend)

The indicators present a mixed picture.  The RSI suggests the stock is not in extreme territory, while the negative PPO signals bearish momentum. The positive relative divergence change suggests that the current price movements are outpacing the underlying trend.  Further analysis is needed to reconcile these signals.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data contains duplicate entries and inconsistencies, making a reliable analysis difficult.  To conduct a proper analysis, consistent and accurate data is needed.  The available data shows a positive trend in EPS and revenue, but the repetitions hinder accurate interpretation.  

| Date       | EPS | Revenue     |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2025-02-14 | 1.38 | $2.20B       |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | $2.04B       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD shows strong revenue and profit margins, but its recent performance has underperformed the S&P 500.  The inconsistent alpha and beta suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The provided earnings data needs clarification and correction to allow for thorough analysis.  The low ROE is another point for concern. The relatively high expected return of 210% over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 needs further explanation to understand the basis of this forecast.  More data, especially consistent financial reports and a clarification of the expected return calculation, is required for a comprehensive and accurate evaluation.  Currently, the outlook is mixed, highlighting the need for further investigation before forming a conclusive opinion.
