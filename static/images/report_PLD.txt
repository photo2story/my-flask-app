* **20-Day Moving Average:** $103.92
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $113.41

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price increase (1.84) indicates a short-term upward bounce.

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest potential for further downward movement in the short term. However, the positive relative divergence suggests a possible short-term upward trend. The substantial positive change in price compared to the previous close (1.84) indicates a recent bounce, but more data is needed to determine if it's a sustained trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistencies, with duplicate entries.  Assuming the duplicate entries are errors, the data suggests a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue, although the growth rate appears to have slowed down recently. Further analysis is needed to confirm these trends and account for potential errors in the data.

| 날짜       | EPS | 매출       |
|------------|-----|------------|
| 2025-02-14 | 1.38 | $2.20 B    |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | $2.04 B    |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.93 | $2.01 B    |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals strong revenue growth and consistently high profit margins.  However, the Return on Equity (ROE) remains relatively low, suggesting potential for improvement in capital efficiency.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.20B | 76.39% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD has historically shown strong performance compared to the S&P 500, with a high expected return over the long term.  However, recent performance has been volatile, and short-term indicators suggest potential for further price decline.  The high profit margins and consistent revenue growth are positive signs, but the relatively low ROE indicates room for improvement in capital efficiency.  Investors should consider the inherent risks associated with this stock, especially considering the significant market sensitivity indicated by beta values and the recent periods of significant negative return.  Thorough due diligence and a long-term investment horizon are advisable.  The accuracy of this analysis is limited by the quality and completeness of the provided data, particularly concerning the earnings data.  Further investigation is recommended.
