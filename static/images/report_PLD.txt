**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Prologis Inc. (PLD) is a leading global real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in logistics and distribution facilities.  PLD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, exhibiting a 43.46% higher cumulative return.  The relative divergence from the S&P 500 places PLD in the 34.6th percentile of its historical range (max 146.7%, min -11.4%).

The alpha/beta analysis reveals considerable variability in performance across different time periods. While consistently showing a positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), indicating skillful management or unique market positioning, the beta (market sensitivity) fluctuates significantly.  High beta values (e.g., 2019-2021) suggest heightened market sensitivity, while lower values indicate less sensitivity to overall market movements. The negative CAGR in the last two periods highlights significant recent volatility and potential risks.  Further investigation into market conditions during these periods is needed.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2025-04-29 | $0.64 | $2.14 Billion |

| 2025-02-14 | $1.08 | $2.04 Billion | *Duplicate Entry*
| 2024-07-26 | $0.93 | $2.01 Billion |

Earnings show some volatility.  Note the duplicate entry for 2025-02-14 needs clarification. A deeper dive into the financial statements is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial health.


**5. Financial Information:**

No detailed financial information (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) is available, limiting a complete financial health assessment.  This lack of data is a significant constraint to a robust analysis.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PLD has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showcasing strong alpha generation,  but the recent negative CAGR and missing key financial data pose concerns. The high expected return (164.9%) is promising but contingent on consistent future outperformance. The medium risk level (MRI) suggests caution.  Further investigation into the recent negative performance (2022-2025), missing financial data, and confirmation of the duplicated earnings data point are crucial before making any investment decisions.  A more comprehensive analysis involving detailed financial statements and broader macroeconomic factors is recommended.
