*   **Analysis:** The news is mixed. Valuation concerns could lead to increased scrutiny and potentially limit further price appreciation. However, positive earnings growth, potential dividend increases, and new ventures like data centers could be positive catalysts. Institutional activity is always worth noting, but both buying and selling activity is reported, indicating some disagreement among large investors.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

    *   Positive analyst sentiment and target prices suggest upside potential.
    *   "Hybrid Signal" recommends buying, suggesting an attractive entry point.
