2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Prologis (PLD) based on the provided data.

**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Prologis Inc. is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in logistics facilities.
*   **PLD Cumulative Return:** 77.29%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 99.09%
*   **Divergence:** -22.6 (PLD underperformed VOO by 22.6%)
*   **Relative Divergence:** 18.0 (PLD's current divergence is near the low end of its historical divergence range).

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR and MDD:**

The provided table shows Prologis' performance and risk metrics over rolling 3-year periods:

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Highly variable, ranging from -65% to 98%. This indicates a volatile growth pattern. Recent CAGRs (2020-2025) show a decline.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, hovering around 70-80%, indicating significant potential for loss from peak to trough. This highlights the risk associated with PLD.
*   **Alpha:** Varies significantly. Positive Alpha (outperformance vs. benchmark) in periods like 2017-2019 and 2019-2021. Significantly negative Alpha in more recent periods (2022-2025, 2023-2025), implying underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Consistently around 0.5-0.6, suggests that PLD is less volatile than the overall market (S&P 500). However, in 2023-2025 the beta has increased, to 0.8.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Cap in Billions):** Shows growth in market capitalization over time, although affected by stock performance in recent years.

**Overall Interpretation of Table:**  PLD exhibited periods of strong growth and outperformance, but recent years show significant underperformance (negative Alpha and low/negative CAGR) and continued high drawdown risk.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 127.66
*   **Previous Close:** 128.07
*   **Change:** -0.32
*   **5-day SMA:** 128.912
*   **20-day SMA:** 127.6573
*   **60-day SMA:** 123.0935

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly down from its previous close. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA and both are above the 60-day SMA, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend. The fact that the 20-day SMA is nearly the same with the current price means that it can potentially drop in the following days.

**3) RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 48.04 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.203 (Slightly below zero, indicating a potential weakening trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Suggests a 100% Buy recommendation with 0% cash, based on a "Very Safe" rating and MRI of 0.90. The Hybrid Signal suggests monthly investment.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 3.4 (+), suggesting a short-term upward movement.
*   **Fluctuation note:**  The small change from the previous close (-0.32) doesn't suggest a significant fluctuation issue.
*   **Expected Return:** 37.8% (Projected excess return vs. S&P 500 over 2+ years).

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of risk, while the Hybrid Signal gives a "Buy" recommendation.  The RSI is neutral. The positive recent divergence change provides a short-term bullish signal. The high expected return is encouraging, but the discrepancy with the negative Alpha in recent years from the table above should be noted.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Outlook:** Several articles suggest a positive long-term outlook for Prologis ("Top Stock for the Long-Term").
*   **Institutional Selling:** StrongBox Wealth LLC sold a significant number of shares, which could create temporary downward pressure.
*   **Defensive Play:** One article discusses PLD as a potential defensive play in an uncertain market.
*   **Dividend and Data Centers:** News mentions potential dividend hikes and a push into data centers.
*   **Risk Channels:** Mentions risk channels and responsive allocation strategies, suggesting potential concerns and active risk management being discussed.

**Analysis:**  The news presents a mixed picture. Positive long-term sentiment and potential growth areas (data centers) are counterbalanced by institutional selling and discussions of risk management.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean rating of 1.92)
*   **Target Price:** Average of $131.90 (implies potential upside from the current price of $127.66)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No specific recent rating changes are provided.

**Analysis:**  Analysts generally have a positive outlook on PLD, with a "Buy" consensus and a target price higher than the current trading price. The lack of recent rating changes limits further conclusions.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue  |
| ---------- | ---- | -------- |
| 2025-10-28 | 0.82 | $2.21 B  |
| 2025-07-30 | 0.61 | $2.18 B  |
| 2025-04-29 | 0.64 | $2.14 B  |
| 2025-02-14 | 1.38 | $2.20 B  |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | $2.04 B  |

**Analysis:** Revenue has been relatively stable, hovering around $2.1 to $2.2 billion. EPS shows some variability, with a notable peak in Q1 2025 (1.38) and a more recent EPS of 0.82. The trend in EPS needs further investigation to determine if it's a temporary fluctuation or a sign of slowing earnings growth.

**6) Financial Information: Revenue and Profitability / Capital and Profitability**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------- |
| 2025-09-30 | $2.21B  | 74.98%          |
| 2025-06-30 | $2.18B  | 74.68%          |
| 2025-03-31 | $2.14B  | 74.34%          |
| 2024-12-31 | $2.20B  | 76.39%          |
| 2024-09-30 | $2.04B  | 76.00%          |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE    |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------- |
| 2025-09-30 | $52.64B  | 1.45%  |
| 2025-06-30 | $52.73B  | 1.08%  |
| 2025-03-31 | $53.47B  | 1.11%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $53.95B  | 2.37%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $53.07B  | 1.90%  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, as seen in the previous section. Profit margins are very high, consistently above 74%, indicating strong operational efficiency. However, there's a slight downward trend in the profit margin over the last few quarters.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is also quite stable. ROE (Return on Equity) has decreased significantly from 2.37% to 1.45% over the last year, and is relatively low. This may be due to the stability of equity without a significant concurrent increase in profit. This is an area of potential concern.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** PLD has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, and the Alpha table also indicated that PLD is underperforming versus the S&P500.
*   **High Drawdown Risk:** The consistently high MDD highlights the significant risk associated with PLD.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Recent technical indicators (RSI neutral, slightly negative PPO) present a mixed picture, while analyst consensus is "Buy" and suggest an upward trajectory.
*   **Stable Revenue, Declining Profitability:** Revenue is stable, but profit margins are showing a slight downward trend, and ROE has decreased noticeably.
*   **Positive Long-Term Sentiment:** News articles suggest a positive long-term outlook.
*   **Potential Catalysts:** Potential dividend hikes and expansion into data centers could be positive catalysts.
*   **Areas of Concern:** Institutional selling and discussions of risk channels warrant caution.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is warranted. While analysts are generally positive and the expected return is attractive, the recent underperformance, high drawdown risk, slightly declining profitability, and institutional selling raise concerns. Potential investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing in Prologis. The "Buy" recommendation from the Hybrid Signal and analysts should be balanced against the negative trends and risks identified.
