**0. Key Figures Overview:**

PLD, Prologis Inc., is a global real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in logistics and industrial properties.  The following analysis summarizes key performance indicators and recent financial data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **PLD Cumulative Return:** 83.31%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 56.39%
* **Return Difference:** 26.92%
* **Relative Divergence:** 27.8% (This indicates PLD's outperformance relative to its historical range against VOO.  It's not a measure of absolute superiority.)

PLD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The relative divergence suggests this outperformance falls within the upper quartile of its historical performance against the index.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values over time.  While alpha (0.0 to 0.6) generally suggests some degree of outperformance relative to the market (beta), the high beta values (46.0 to 141.8) indicate PLD's returns are significantly more volatile than the market. The negative CAGR and significant MDD in the last two periods (2022-2024 & 2023-2025) highlights substantial risk and recent underperformance.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 43.0% | 57.5% | 13.0% | 0.0 | 49.1 |

| 2018-2020  | 48.0% | 64.4% | 23.0% | 0.3 | 82.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 148.0% | 15.9% | 94.0% | 0.3 | 141.8 |

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $91.75
* **Last Market Price:** $91.64 (a decrease of $3.05 from the previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $103.07
* **20-day Moving Average:** $109.47
* **60-day Moving Average:** $114.69

The stock price is significantly below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price drop of $3.05 suggests a potential period of short-term instability.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 19.44 (Oversold; often suggests a potential bounce, but not guaranteed)
* **PPO:** -1.57 (Negative PPO confirms a bearish trend.)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -13.3% (Short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 192.4% (This suggests a high potential for outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term,  but it's crucial to remember this is an *estimate* and subject to substantial uncertainty, particularly given the recent negative performance)

The combination of over-sold RSI, a negative PPO, and a high MRI signals a high-risk, potentially oversold environment. While the expected return is high,  it needs to be viewed with caution due to the current market situation and inherent market volatility.  The sharp recent price drop strengthens concerns about short term risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistencies. There are duplicate entries for some dates.  A more reliable and complete dataset is needed for a thorough analysis.  However, the available data shows relatively stable revenue around $2 billion, with slight EPS growth.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies is recommended.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue    |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2025-02-14 | 1.38 | $2.20B      |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | $2.04B      |
| 2025-02-14 | 1.08 | $2.04B      |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.93 | $2.01B      |
| 2025-02-14 | 0.93 | $2.01B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability sections show relatively consistent financial performance over the past five quarters.  Revenue remains stable around $2 Billion, and profit margins are consistently high (72-76%).  ROE is relatively low, suggesting potentially low efficiency in capital utilization. More detailed analysis, including further financial ratios, is needed for a complete assessment.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.20B | 76.39% |

| 2024-09-30 | $53.07B  | 1.90% |
| 2024-06-30 | $53.35B  | 1.61% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD has historically shown strong performance relative to the S&P 500, but recent data reveals a significant downturn. While the long-term expected return is high, the current market indicators (MRI, RSI, PPO) suggest a high-risk environment. The substantial negative CAGR and MDD in the recent periods must be considered.  The recent price drop and the discrepancies in the earnings data warrant further investigation. Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to conduct thorough due diligence, review updated financial statements, and consider the inherent volatility of the real estate and market conditions.  The high beta suggests that while long term upside may exist, it's associated with potentially large downside risk.  A thorough reassessment of risk tolerance is essential.
