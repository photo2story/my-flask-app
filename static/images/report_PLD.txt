While PLD's cumulative return (91.7%) lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) at 119.9% over the analyzed period, it shows periods of significant outperformance and  a relatively low correlation to the broader market as indicated by its beta.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Prologis Inc (PLD) has shown a cumulative return of 91.698% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) return of 119.909%.  This represents a difference of -28.2%, placing it at the 13th percentile relative to its historical range of performance against the S&P 500 (-51.8% to 129.3%).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $119.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $120.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $112.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $111.61

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting some recent downward pressure. However, it is significantly above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term upward trend.  The recent price drop of -1.16% from the previous close should be noted.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.81 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.95 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +1.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 259.7% (Significant outperformance compared to S&P 500 over a 2+ year investment horizon)


The high RSI value suggests the stock is currently overbought and might be susceptible to a price correction.  However, the positive PPO and recent relative strength suggest continued upward momentum in the short term.  The significant predicted long-term excess return warrants attention, yet should be viewed with caution due to its nature as a prediction.  The recent price drop may be a sign of a short-term correction within the longer upward trend.
