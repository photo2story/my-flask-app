*   **60-day SMA:** 124.30

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently slightly below the 20-day SMA but above the 5-day SMA, suggesting a short-term uptrend.

*   **RSI:** 52.17 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.18 (Slightly bearish)

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -1.0 (Short-term decline)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, which seems optimistic given the underperformance relative to the S&P 500. The RSI is neutral, while the PPO is slightly bearish. The negative divergence change reinforces the short-term downward trend. The high expected return suggests potential future outperformance, but this should be viewed with caution considering the recent performance and negative alpha.

| 2024-09-30   | $53.07B   | 1.90%    |

**Analysis:** Revenue demonstrates consistent growth, and profit margins remain exceptionally high, indicating strong efficiency in Prologis's operations. However, ROE has decreased from 2.37% in 2024-12-31 to 1.45% in 2025-09-30. This suggests that while the company is profitable, the return on equity is declining.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Prologis (PLD) presents a mixed investment picture. While analysts are generally positive ("Buy" rating) and revenue is steadily increasing, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Key concerns include the fluctuating EPS and the decreasing ROE despite the high profit margin. The MRI shows High Investment Recommended, however other indicators like fluctuating Alpha, slightly bearish PPO and recent Relative Divergence Change raise concern.

The news headlines are also mixed, with some positive developments (dividend increases, potential data center expansion) offset by negative factors (institutional selling, underperformance relative to the market).

The stock is currently trading close to its 20-day SMA, indicating a possible short-term stabilization or uptrend. However, the longer-term picture is less clear.

**Overall, a cautious approach is warranted.** The high expected return could be attractive, but investors should carefully consider the recent underperformance, inconsistent Alpha, and the potentially overoptimistic MRI. Monitoring the company's progress in its strategic initiatives (e.g., data centers) and the broader economic environment is crucial. The stock price warrants further investigation for possible positive rebound.
