The table shows significant volatility in CAGR and considerable negative returns in recent years.  Alpha is generally positive, suggesting some outperformance relative to the market benchmark, however, it's highly inconsistent. Beta increased significantly in recent years, indicating increased sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downward pressure.  However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential longer-term upward trend.  The recent price change (-$0.04) is minimal and doesn't signal a significant event.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

RSI of 48.78 is near the neutral level (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. A negative PPO (-0.06) suggests bearish momentum. The positive change in relative divergence (+1.3) indicates a short-term upward trend. The expected return of 252.6% over the long term (2+ years) suggests significant outperformance potential compared to the S&P 500.  This high projected return needs to be evaluated against the risk presented by the data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS | 매출        |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2025-02-14 | 1.38 | 2.20 B$     |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | 2.04 B$     |
| 2025-02-14 | 1.08 | 2.04 B$     |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.93 | 2.01 B$     |
| 2025-02-14 | 0.93 | 2.01 B$     |

There's a duplication of data in this table.  Ignoring the duplicates, we see a generally upward trend in both EPS and revenue, though the most recent EPS is notably higher than the preceding quarters.  Further analysis is needed to understand the variability and drivers of this growth.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $2.04B | 76.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.01B | 74.31% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.96B | 72.76% |
| 2023-12-31 | $1.89B | 74.22% |
| 2023-09-30 | $1.91B | 73.88% |

Revenue shows a generally upward trend, although it has plateaued in the last two quarters. Profit margins are consistently high but exhibit some fluctuation.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $53.07B | 1.90% |
| 2024-06-30 | $53.35B | 1.61% |
| 2024-03-31 | $53.19B | 1.10% |
| 2023-12-31 | $53.18B | 1.19% |
| 2023-09-30 | $53.64B | 1.39% |

Equity is relatively stable, while ROE shows some variation.  The ROE is relatively low compared to profit margin, which warrants further investigation into the capital structure and financial leverage.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD shows a mixed performance picture. While it has shown strong revenue growth and high profit margins, its recent return underperformed the S&P 500, and the company's volatility is high.  Long-term expected returns are projected to significantly outperform the market, but this projection must be carefully evaluated against the inconsistency in recent years' performance and high beta.  Further investigation into the drivers of earnings growth, the reasons for ROE lagging profit margins, and the potential risks affecting PLD's future performance is needed before a conclusive investment decision can be made.  The seemingly high expected return requires a careful assessment of the inherent risks involved.
