**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD shows mixed signals. While it boasts strong revenue growth and high profit margins, recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, showing high sensitivity to market fluctuations (high beta).  The high expected return requires further scrutiny. The inconsistencies in the provided earnings data need clarification.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term rebound but also point towards a bearish trend. A more comprehensive analysis, considering macroeconomic factors and a thorough review of the inconsistent data, is necessary for a robust investment decision.  The high long-term expected return needs to be examined carefully to assess its plausibility and the potential risks involved before making any investment decisions.
