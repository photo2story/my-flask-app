**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Prologis Inc. (PLD) is a leading global owner, operator, and developer of logistics real estate.  PLD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return 24.4% higher than VOO.  The relative divergence metric suggests this outperformance is relatively strong compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show that PLD's performance has generally outperformed the market (positive alpha), particularly in 2019-2021, while exhibiting higher than average market sensitivity (beta > 1). However, recent years (2022-2025) show negative CAGR and  high MDD, suggesting significant volatility and potential underperformance recently.  The large swings in CAGR highlight the cyclical nature of the real estate market.  The increase in beta in the recent years could suggest increased market sensitivity and a need to further analyse this period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $96.23
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $94.72
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $106.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $114.03

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price increase of $1.41 from the previous close indicates a short-term uptick, but the overall trend appears bearish.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 33.25 (Oversold territory, indicating potential bounce)
* **PPO:** -1.27 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -9.5% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 210.6% (Significant outperformance of S&P 500 expected in the long run)

The combination of overbought RSI and negative PPO signals mixed signals.  The negative relative divergence and MRI value of 0.47 suggest increased risk and bearish sentiment currently. However, the high expected return over the long term is a bullish signal. The recent price increase of $1.41 could signal a bounce but does not fundamentally alter the bearish trend signaled by the other indicators.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD has historically outperformed the S&P 500, particularly in the period 2019-2021. However, recent performance shows significant volatility and underperformance compared to the market.  While long-term prospects remain positive, as suggested by the high expected return,  current indicators suggest a high-risk environment.  The recent price increase provides a short-term positive signal; however, the underlying bearish trend should be carefully considered.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent negative CAGR and high MDD is recommended, along with clarification of the duplicate data entries in the earnings report.  A thorough analysis of the sector and the company's long-term strategic direction is crucial before making any investment decisions.
