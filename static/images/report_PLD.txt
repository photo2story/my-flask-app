**0. Overview:**

Prologis Inc. is a leading global provider of logistics real estate.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PLD's cumulative return is 88.67%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) achieved 117.48%.  This represents a difference of -28.8 percentage points. The relative divergence, considering historical maximum and minimum differences, places the current difference at the 12.7th percentile.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant variation in PLD's CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), Alpha, and Beta over the analyzed periods.  High CAGRs (e.g., 154% from 2019-2021) are coupled with periods of high maximum drawdown (MDD) and high Beta, suggesting high risk and volatility.  The recent negative CAGRs (-106% from 2022-2024 and -29% from 2023-2025) highlight a recent downturn. Beta consistently increased until 2023-2025, indicating increased sensitivity to market fluctuations during this period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $117.82
* **5-day Moving Average:** $119.42
* **20-day Moving Average:** $112.90
* **60-day Moving Average:** $111.70

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible bearish trend.  The recent price drop (-1.19 from the previous close) further reinforces this.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (70.76):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term correction.
* **PPO (0.65):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum, although the recent price drop might indicate a weakening of this momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-2.5):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend.


The significant price drop (-$1.19) from the previous close needs further investigation to determine if it signals a potential larger downward trend or just short-term volatility.  The high expected return (266.3%) over the long term (2+ years) suggests a potential positive outlook for long-term investors despite the recent price decline, provided market conditions improve.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD shows strong revenue growth and high profitability.  However, recent price performance has lagged the S&P 500, and technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term correction. The high projected long-term return suggests potential for long-term growth, but the recent negative CAGRs and high beta warrant caution.  Further analysis is needed to determine the causes of recent price declines and whether the current price represents a buying opportunity.  Considering the high Beta, investors should be prepared for significant volatility.  Careful monitoring of macroeconomic factors affecting the real estate and logistics sectors is critical.
