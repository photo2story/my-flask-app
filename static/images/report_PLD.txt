The company has strong fundamentals with consistent revenue growth, high profit margins, and positive ROE. However, the debt-to-equity ratio remains high, which may influence investor sentiment. Overall, PLD is a company with a solid track record but its future performance will depend on the market's reaction to the global economic situation, the continued strength of the logistics sector, and the company's ability to manage its debt.

* **Short-term:** Given the current downtrend and the lack of strong growth expectations, investors may want to consider a wait-and-see approach. 
* **Long-term:** For long-term investors, PLD remains an attractive option due to its strong fundamentals and its position in a growing industry.
