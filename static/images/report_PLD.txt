## PLD (Prologis Inc.) Stock Analysis

**Company Overview:** Prologis Inc. is a leading owner, operator, and developer of industrial logistics real estate.

### 1.  Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **Cumulative Return:**
    *   PLD: 103.70%
    *   VOO: 104.48%
*   **Return Difference:** -0.78%
*   **Detachment (Dispersion):**

    *   Min: -72.2
    *   Current: -59.6
    *   Relative Detachment: 4.8

**Analysis:** PLD's cumulative return is slightly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) by 0.78%.  The relative detachment of 4.8 indicates that the current difference between PLD and VOO's performance is near the lower end of its historical range.

**Analysis:** This table provides insights into PLD's risk-adjusted performance over rolling 3-year periods.

*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Generally high, indicating substantial potential for losses during downturns.

*   **Beta:** Generally low (close to zero), suggesting low systematic risk or low correlation to the market (S&P500). However, beta increased recently, rising to 0.7.

### 2. Recent Stock Price Movements

*   **Current Price:** 115.35

    *   Price: 115.35
    *   Previous Close: 114.82

    *   60-day: 108.5563

**Analysis:** The stock price is trending upwards, as evidenced by the price being above all three moving averages. The fact that the 5-day moving average is above the 20-day, which is above the 60-day, confirms this upward trend.  The recent change of 0.46 from the previous close isn't dramatically large, so there's no indication of a major sudden price swing based on this single data point.

*   **Expected Return:** A very high expected return relative to the S&P 500 is provided, *assuming* a long-term (2+ year) dollar-cost averaging investment strategy. This should be viewed with caution, as such high returns are not guaranteed and depend heavily on future market conditions.

### 5. Recent Earnings Analysis

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-07-30 | 0.61 | 2.18 B$      |
| 2025-04-29 | 0.64 | 2.14 B$      |

| 2025-02-14 | 1.08 | 2.04 B$      |

**Analysis:** The recent earnings data shows some volatility in EPS, with a higher value earlier in the period. There is a notable anomaly with the 2025-02-14 row appearing twice with different values; this suggests a data error and should be clarified with the original source. Recent revenue has been relatively stable but has experienced modest growth.

### 7. Overall Summary

Based on the provided information, here's a summarized analysis of PLD:

*   **Performance:** PLD is slightly underperforming the S&P 500 currently. Historical data shows periods of strong outperformance but also significant underperformance.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The stock is in an uptrend, approaching overbought territory.
*   **Risk:** The MRI suggests a low-risk environment, but the high MDD values indicate potential for significant losses.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Generally positive, with a "Buy" consensus and a slightly higher average target price.
*   **Earnings & Financials:** Solid revenue and profit margins, but ROE has shown a decrease, and the recent EPS values decreased.
*   **News:** Mixed, with some articles highlighting underperformance relative to the broader market.

**Conclusion:**

PLD presents a mixed investment picture. While analyst sentiment is positive and the technical indicators suggest an uptrend, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and concerns raised in recent news articles warrant caution. The high expected return quoted is very aggressive and should be carefully considered in the context of the company's historical performance and the overall market outlook.  Investors should carefully weigh the risks and potential rewards before investing in PLD.
