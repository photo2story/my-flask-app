| 2022-2024  | -61.0%  | 32.1% | -80.0% | 1.0  | 98.2   |
| 2023-2025  | 2.0%    | 24.0% | -60.0% | 1.0  | 118.6  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Fluctuates significantly, from negative to very positive, indicating volatile performance over different periods.  The recent years (2022-2025) show very low to negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates the potential downside risk. Drawdowns have been significant, peaking at 32.1%, which is substantial.
*   **Alpha:** Represents the excess return compared to the benchmark.  Notice the large negative alpha in 2018-2020, 2022-2025, and 2023-2025, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark during those periods. Positive Alpha in 2017-2019 and 2019-2021 shows a period of outperformance.
*   **Beta:**  Generally around 1.0, suggesting PLD's volatility is similar to the overall market. Beta above 1.0 shows that the stock price is more volatile than the market and below 1.0 means the stock price is less volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in Billions. Reflects the size and scale of the company.

**Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta analysis paints a mixed picture. PLD has shown periods of strong outperformance (high Alpha), but also periods of significant underperformance and large drawdowns. The relatively consistent Beta of 1.0 implies market-level systematic risk.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 129.05
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 129.05, Previous Close: 127.66, Change: 1.09
*   **5-day SMA:** 128.58
*   **20-day SMA:** 128.47
*   **60-day SMA:** 125.40

**Analysis:** The stock price is trading above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term uptrend. The small difference between the 5-day and 20-day SMA suggests that the uptrend is a relatively recent development and has not yet been sustained. The fact that the 60-day SMA is significantly lower indicates that the longer-term trend is still positive.

**3) RSI, PPO and other Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 43.18 (Neutral. Typically, below 30 is oversold, above 70 is overbought.)
*   **PPO:** -0.15 (Slightly negative, suggests a short-term downtrend relative to longer-term trends)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (8 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 15.8 (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates a "Medium Investment" recommendation, suggesting moderate risk.  The RSI is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions. The negative PPO suggests short-term weakness. Hybrid Signal indicates positive outlook for the stock. The positive change in relative divergence over the last 20 days supports the short-term uptrend identified in the moving average analysis. The expected return of 15.8% is a significant figure, suggesting potential outperformance over the long term, although past underperformance must be considered. The last-market data indicating a change of 1.09 suggests recent positive movement, but not an extreme fluctuation.

**Analysis:** Recent news presents a mixed picture. While some institutions are increasing their holdings and there's optimism about long-term prospects, there's also news of underperformance and decreased holdings by others. This suggests uncertainty and potentially conflicting views on the stock's near-term trajectory. The company's expansion into data centers and potential dividend hikes create further uncertainty.

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.92)

**Analysis:**  Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating with a mean score leaning towards "Buy".  The average target price of $132.95 represents a potential upside from the current price of $129.05. The range of target prices suggests some disagreement among analysts about the potential upside.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜         | EPS  | 매출      |
|--------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-10-28 | 0.82 | 2.21 B$   |
| 2025-07-30 | 0.61 | 2.18 B$   |
| 2025-04-29 | 0.64 | 2.14 B$   |
| 2025-02-14 | 1.38 | 2.20 B$   |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | 2.04 B$   |

**Analysis:** Revenue appears to be relatively stable, fluctuating between $2.04B and $2.21B. EPS, however, shows more variability. There's a drop in EPS in the middle of 2025, which could be a point of concern. It's important to investigate *why* the EPS fluctuated.

**6) Financial Information**

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $2.21B     | 74.98%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $2.18B     | 74.68%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $2.14B     | 74.34%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $2.20B     | 76.39%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $2.04B     | 76.00%        |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE       |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $52.64B    | 1.45%    |
| 2025-06-30 | $52.73B    | 1.08%    |
| 2025-03-31 | $53.47B    | 1.11%    |
| 2024-12-31 | $53.95B    | 2.37%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $53.07B    | 1.90%    |

**Analysis:** Revenue is relatively stable. Profit margins are high, consistently above 74%, indicating a strong business model. Equity is also stable, but ROE (Return on Equity) has fluctuated, with a noticeable drop in recent quarters. The decreasing ROE despite high profit margins is a red flag and needs further investigation.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Overall, the analysis of Prologis (PLD) presents a somewhat unclear investment picture:

*   **Mixed Performance:** PLD has underperformed the S&P 500, but the relative divergence suggests it might be near a potential reversal point. The Alpha/Beta analysis confirms periods of both significant outperformance and underperformance.
*   **Recent Uptrend:** Short-term indicators (SMAs, divergence change) point to a recent uptrend.
*   **Medium Risk:** The MRI suggests moderate risk.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts have a "Buy" rating and a positive target price, indicating potential upside.
*   **Financial Strength Concerns:** While revenue is stable and profit margins are high, the recent decline in EPS and ROE raise concerns about the company's financial performance and efficiency in recent quarters.
*   **News Uncertainty:** Recent news articles present conflicting views, adding to the overall uncertainty.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in PLD at this time appears to be a moderately risky proposition. While there are positive signs – a recent uptrend, analyst optimism, and strong profit margins – the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the mixed news sentiment, and the decline in EPS and ROE suggest caution.

**Recommendation:** Before making any investment decision, it is *critical* to investigate the reasons behind the recent decline in EPS and ROE. Understanding these factors will be crucial in determining whether the current uptrend is sustainable and whether PLD can deliver on its long-term potential. Deeper dive into sector trends and factors influencing REITs in the current economic climate is warranted.
