**1) Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Prologis Inc. is a leading global logistics real estate company.  PLD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return 41.7 percentage points higher.  The relative divergence suggests this outperformance is relatively strong compared to historical performance differentials.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating Alpha and Beta values.  High alpha values (e.g., 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7) in certain years indicate periods of significant outperformance relative to the market.  The high beta values (generally above 0.1) suggest PLD's price is highly sensitive to market fluctuations.  The high CAGR values in some years point to strong growth potential, while the substantial MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures highlight the inherent risk involved. Note the significant negative CAGR values in the most recent years;  this requires further investigation.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 50.0% | 57.6% | 0.1 | 49.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 36.0% | 64.4% | 0.1 | 46.8 |
| 2017-2019  | 72.0% | 64.4% | 0.3 | 72.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 57.0% | 64.4% | 0.3 | 83.6 |
| 2019-2021  | 167.0% | 15.7% | 107.0% | 0.3 | 144.1 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $105.49
* **Last Market Price:** $106.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $105.15
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $101.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $109.67

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent upward momentum. However, it's below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term bearish trend. The recent price increase of $1.35 is noteworthy and should be further investigated for related news or events.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 60.19 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.91 (Positive; suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 171.0% (Long-term, 2+ years)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI and MRI suggest relatively low risk and reasonable momentum, the price being below longer-term moving averages suggests caution. The high expected return is positive, but requires detailed investigation of the underlying assumptions and justification. The recent price increase of $1.35 does not necessarily indicate a sudden surge or decline, but requires monitoring for underlying events.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and Revenue. Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes of this variability and assess the trend.  Note the duplication of the February 14th data point;  this needs clarification.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-04-29 | 0.64 | $2.14B        |
| 2025-02-14 | 1.38 | $2.20B        |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | $2.04B        |
| 2025-02-14 | 1.08 | $2.04B        |  <!--Duplicate Data-->
| 2024-07-26 | 0.93 | $2.01B        |


**5) Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability, and Capital and Profitability show generally positive trends.  However, the most recent quarter (2025-03-31) shows a slight decrease in Revenue and a drop in Profit Margin and ROE compared to the previous quarter, demanding further scrutiny.  The relatively low ROE values also warrant investigation.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $2.14B  | 74.34%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $2.20B  | 76.39%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $2.04B  | 76.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.01B  | 74.31%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.96B  | 72.76%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE    |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| 2025-03-31 | $53.47B | 1.11%  |
| 2024-12-31 | $53.95B | 2.37%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $53.07B | 1.90%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $53.35B | 1.61%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $53.19B | 1.10%  |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

PLD has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing periods of strong growth and high alpha.  However, recent data reveals significant negative CAGR and potential issues with the most recent quarterly financial performance.   The relatively low ROE warrants deeper analysis.  While the short-term technical indicators are mixed, the long-term expected return is substantial.  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation is crucial, including a thorough analysis of the recent negative CAGR and the reasons behind the fluctuations in earnings and financial metrics.  Addressing the duplicated data point and investigating news and events related to the recent price jump is essential.  A comprehensive risk assessment considering the high beta and maximum drawdown figures is also necessary.
