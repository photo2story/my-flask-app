| 2023-2025  | -27.0% | 21.3% | -76.0% | 0.9 | 111.1 |

The table shows highly volatile CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures, indicating significant periods of both strong growth and substantial losses.  The Alpha values suggest periods of outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha) relative to the market benchmark. Beta consistently exceeds 1, especially in recent years, indicating high market sensitivity. Market capitalization (Cap) fluctuates significantly. The substantial negative CAGR in 2022-2024 is a key area of concern.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $119.91
* **Previous Close:** $120.30
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $121.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $121.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $114.35

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's above its 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term support level.  The recent small price drop (-0.32$) is not significant enough to constitute a sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 46.75 (Slightly below neutral; not overly oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.43 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.2 (+), indicating short-term upward movement.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 151.5% (This implies significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, but this forecast needs further justification and may be overly optimistic given recent performance).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD's performance has lagged the S&P 500 recently, a trend reflected in the negative alpha and the relative underperformance compared to the market. However, the company demonstrates consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, suggesting underlying strength.  The high Beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  The high projected long-term return requires further investigation to justify its feasibility.  The data inconsistencies need to be addressed for a more robust and reliable analysis.  Further due diligence, including a deeper examination of the company's strategic direction, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The recent short-term price dip does not necessarily indicate a negative long-term outlook.  Careful consideration of the risk-reward profile based on your own investment strategy and risk tolerance is paramount.
