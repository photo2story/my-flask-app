## Prologis Inc. (PLD) Investment Review

This report analyzes Prologis Inc. (PLD), a leading global logistics real estate company, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Prologis Inc. (PLD) shows a cumulative return of 67.97% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 117.56% over the analyzed period.  The difference is -49.6%, placing it at the 6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided relative divergence metric (0.6).  This indicates that PLD has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly during this period.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $104.14
* **Last Market Price:** $104.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $104.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $111.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $114.99

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The difference between the last market price ($104.70) and the closing price is negligible and doesn't suggest a significant price jump or drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 26.07 (Suggests oversold conditions, potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.84 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.6 (Short-term upward trend, but the overall trend seems bearish given the moving averages)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This needs clarification. Is this the expected return over the next period, or is it already reflecting the underperformance relative to the S&P500?)


Given the current RSI and PPO, the stock might be experiencing a temporary dip.  However, the negative expected return and the underperformance against the S&P 500 raise concerns. The 0.0% expected return relative to the S&P 500, if accurate, suggests that over the long term (2+ years), an investor would not expect to earn returns above the S&P 500.
