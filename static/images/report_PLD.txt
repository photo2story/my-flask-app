2025-12-31 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Prologis Inc. (PLD) based on the information provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Prologis Inc. is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that invests in logistics facilities.
*   **PLD Cumulative Return:** 79.15%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -24.5 (PLD underperformed VOO)
*   **Relative Divergence:** 16.4 (PLD's current divergence is near its minimum, suggesting it is performing relatively poorly compared to its historical range versus VOO).

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Table:**

The table presents a mixed picture of Prologis' performance relative to the market (as measured by Alpha and Beta) and its own inherent risk (as measured by CAGR and MDD) over rolling three-year periods.

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Highly variable, ranging from -65% to 98%. Recent periods (2022-2024 and 2023-2025) show weak or negative growth. The period from 2019-2021 was an outlier for performance.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses. Above 67.8% is very high, and indicates that at any one time, investors may lose more than 67.8% of their funds from when they started investing.
*   **Alpha:** Measures excess return compared to the market. Notice the recent sharp declines in Alpha in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025. The period from 2019-2021 was an outlier for performance.
*   **Beta:** Relatively stable around 0.5-0.8. This indicates that PLD's price movements are generally less volatile than the overall market (S&P 500). This seems counter intuitive given high MDD scores, but note that PLD may not be tracking with the market and have its own inherent risks.
*   **Cap (B):** The capitalization (in Billions) varies, showing growth followed by recent declines, indicating the stock is not performing as well as it was in previous periods.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** $129.01
*   **Previous Close:** $128.48
*   **Change:** $0.41 (Slight increase)
*   **5-day SMA:** 128.624
*   **20-day SMA:** 128.4622
*   **60-day SMA:** 124.712

**Analysis:**

The current price is above the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The 60-day SMA is significantly lower, indicating a longer-term upward trend. The small change from the previous close suggests relative price stability in the very short term.

**3) RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 60.21 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.1389 (Slightly below zero, indicating a slightly bearish trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash, monthly invest 0.8% (suggests a confident buy recommendation with staggered investment).
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.3 (Short-term decline relative to the comparison index)
*   **Price Fluctuation:** The $0.41 change from previous close is small, not indicative of sharp rebounds or declines.
*   **Expected Return:** 39.2% (Significant expected excess return over S&P 500 if held long-term)

**Analysis:**

The MRI is high, indicating a generally favorable market environment for investment. The RSI is neutral. The PPO suggests a slight bearish trend. The hybrid signal is a buy recommendation. Despite the short-term divergence decline, the long-term expected return is very positive.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Prologis presents a mixed investment case:

*   **Strengths:** Strong market position in logistics real estate, consistent revenue growth, very high profit margins, analyst buy rating, positive news related to dividends and data centers, and a high MRI. The Hybird Signal also suggests the stock is a solid Buy.
*   **Weaknesses:** Underperformance compared to the S&P 500, volatile CAGR, consistently high maximum drawdown, declining profit margins, declining ROE, recent negative Alpha, and recent negative relative divergence.
*   **Outlook:** The high expected return suggests that if Prologis can address its underperformance issues, it has significant potential. The recent news regarding dividend increases and a push into data centers could be positive catalysts. However, the high MDD is a concern.
*   **Investment Recommendation:** Based on the "Hybrid Signal," the stock is a suggested buy, with the investment strategy to be staggered to manage risk.
