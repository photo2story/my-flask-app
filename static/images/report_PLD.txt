## Prologis Inc. (PLD) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

PLD's cumulative return (85.32%) slightly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) at 89.44%.  However, considering the relative divergence, PLD's performance is within the acceptable range compared to its historical volatility against the S&P 500.  Recent price movements show a slight downward trend, with the price below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting potential short-term weakness.  While RSI indicates the stock is in oversold territory (42.8), the negative PPO (-0.048) suggests a weakening momentum.

**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Prologis Inc. (PLD) is a leading global real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in logistics and industrial properties.

* **Cumulative Return (PLD):** 85.32%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 89.44%
* **Return Difference:** -4.12%
* **Relative Divergence:** 18.1% (This means PLD's current underperformance relative to the S&P 500 falls within the 18.1st percentile of its historical performance range against the index. It doesn't indicate significant underperformance in the long run.)

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods. While alpha consistently remains positive, indicating outperformance compared to the market benchmark (albeit small in most periods), beta fluctuates significantly, suggesting substantial market sensitivity.  The dramatic negative CAGR and MDD values in the 2022-2025 period warrant careful examination, as they represent unusually poor performance compared to previous years.  This needs further investigation beyond the provided data to understand the underlying reasons.

* **Closing Price:** 111.45
* **Last Market Price:** 110.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 111.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 113.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 114.97

The stock price is below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a downward trend.  The recent price drop of -$0.51 suggests short-term selling pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4382 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.82 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.048 (Negative, indicating weakening momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +2.9 (Short-term upward movement, but needs to be evaluated within a broader context.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 206.0% (This represents a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term, but its achievability requires careful consideration of the risks outlined above, especially the large negative CAGR recently observed). The recent price drop doesn't dramatically alter this long-term projection but should raise caution about short-term volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent, with duplicate entries.  Assuming only unique entries represent actual earnings, the data shows generally increasing EPS and revenue, however the recent data is incomplete and needs clarification.  A more thorough analysis requires complete and consistent data.

| Date        | EPS | Revenue     |
|-------------|-----|-------------|
| 2025-02-14  | 1.38 | $2.20 B     |
| 2024-10-25  | 1.08 | $2.04 B     |
| 2024-07-26  | 0.93 | $2.01 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information shows consistent revenue growth and high profit margins.  However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is relatively low considering the high profit margins, indicating potentially inefficient capital utilization or other factors affecting profitability which require additional investigation.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.20B | 76.39% |
| 2024-09-30 | $2.04B | 76.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.01B | 74.31% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.96B | 72.76% |
| 2023-12-31 | $1.89B | 74.22% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $53.95B | 2.37% |
| 2024-09-30 | $53.07B | 1.90% |
| 2024-06-30 | $53.35B | 1.61% |
| 2024-03-31 | $53.19B | 1.10% |
| 2023-12-31 | $53.18B | 1.19% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD shows long-term potential with consistent revenue growth and high profit margins.  However, the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the significant negative CAGR in the most recent period raise concerns.  The relatively low ROE despite high profit margins requires further investigation. While the long-term projected return is substantial,  the inconsistent and incomplete data provided limits the ability to confidently support or refute this projection.  More detailed financial statements and an analysis of the reasons behind the recent negative performance are essential for a complete assessment.  The current market signals indicate short-term weakness but do not decisively contradict the long-term outlook; nevertheless, caution is advised.  Thorough due diligence is necessary before making any investment decisions.
