The provided relative divergence metric of 0.0 indicates that this underperformance is at the lower extreme of the historical range for this comparison.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $111.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $114.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $117.71

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.47 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.42 –  This negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -3.9 – This signifies a recent decline in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  This indicates no expectation of outperforming the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) based on the current data.  Given the current price being below moving averages and the significantly lower return than VOO, this aligns with current trends and should be considered cautious. There is substantial risk involved.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a generally increasing revenue trend, however it's not linear, and it lacks context on expectations and analyst estimates.

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue has increased from $1.89B to $2.04B over the last five quarters. The growth trend isn't strictly consistent.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS shows some volatility. While it shows a peak in the most recent quarter (1.08), it generally does not show consistent increases.
* **Comparison with Previous Quarters:** The most recent quarter shows the highest EPS and revenue. Comparing each quarter sequentially only offers a limited understanding without information on analyst expectations.  We cannot evaluate beats or misses without such data.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable in the $2B range over the reported period. Profit margins, while high, show slight fluctuation. This stability, with a slightly decreased profit margin in the most recent quarter, deserves further scrutiny.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity is relatively consistent around $53B. Return on Equity (ROE) is low and fluctuates, indicating potentially inefficient capital allocation, although more context would be needed to confirm this.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information on recent news, market outlook, or analyst opinions is provided.  This is a crucial missing element for a comprehensive analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PLD has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period, showing a substantial negative return difference. Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold and currently showing bearish momentum.  Recent earnings show growing revenue, but without additional context regarding expectations and market performance for the underlying business, it is impossible to ascertain profitability and future prospects.  The data indicates a significant risk in investing in PLD at this time, given the high beta, variable CAGR, and current negative momentum.
