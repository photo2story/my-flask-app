**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Prologis Inc. is a global leader in logistics real estate, owning and managing a portfolio of industrial properties.  PLD significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the review period, with a cumulative return 45.1 percentage points higher.  While the relative divergence suggests this outperformance is within the historical range of its performance versus VOO, the magnitude is notable.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different periods.  The high alpha values in some periods (especially 2019-2021) demonstrate strong outperformance relative to the market.  However, the recent negative CAGR and high MDD suggest a period of significant downturn.  The consistently high beta indicates PLD's strong sensitivity to market movements.  The market cap increased significantly during the period, reflecting its growth.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price drop of $3.4 from the previous close indicates a significant negative short-term movement.

* **Closing Price:** $98.63
* **5-Day MA:** $99.56
* **20-Day MA:** $102.93
* **60-Day MA:** $112.89


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 35.78 suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.  The PPO is positive, albeit low, suggesting some upward momentum. The 20-day relative divergence increase of 4.5 points towards short-term upward movement.  The MRI suggests a medium risk level. The large negative change in price of $3.4 reflects a significant recent drop.  The expected return of 157.4% over the long term (2+ years) represents significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500; this should be considered in the context of the high risk associated with such a projection and the recent price drop.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistency and potential duplication of entries.  There is a need for clarification on the data.  Nevertheless, revenue has remained relatively stable around $2B, while EPS shows some fluctuation.  Further investigation is needed to properly analyze the earnings trend.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue    |
|------------|-----|------------|
| 2025-02-14 | 1.38 | $2.20 B    |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | $2.04 B    |
| 2025-02-14 | 1.08 | $2.04 B    |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.93 | $2.01 B    |
| 2025-02-14 | 0.93 | $2.01 B    |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has shown a generally upward trend, with profit margins remaining consistently high (above 70%). ROE is low, suggesting that the company's equity is not generating high returns on investment. Further analysis of the financial statements would be needed to fully understand the implications of these numbers.


| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $2.20B     | 76.39%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $2.04B     | 76.00%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $2.01B     | 74.31%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $1.96B     | 72.76%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $1.89B     | 74.22%        |


| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE     |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31  | $53.95B     | 2.37%   |
| 2024-09-30  | $53.07B     | 1.90%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $53.35B     | 1.61%   |
| 2024-03-31  | $53.19B     | 1.10%   |
| 2023-12-31  | $53.18B     | 1.19%   |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD has historically shown strong performance relative to the S&P 500, with periods of significant alpha generation.  However, recent data shows a concerning downward trend in price and negative CAGR,  coupled with high MDD.  While the oversold RSI might suggest a buying opportunity,  the negative price movement and relatively low PPO raise caution. The low ROE needs further investigation.  The high expected return should be viewed with skepticism, given the inherent volatility of the stock and the recency of negative performance.  A more thorough fundamental analysis and consideration of the company's specific risks is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistent and possibly duplicated earnings data requires clarification.
