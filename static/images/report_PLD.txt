## Prologis Inc. (PLD) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Prologis Inc. (PLD), a leading global real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in logistics and industrial properties, shows a cumulative return of 77.3% compared to the S&P 500's 85.4%. While underperforming the S&P 500, PLD exhibits positive alpha and relatively stable profitability despite recent negative price movements.  Further analysis is needed to determine the long-term investment potential.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PLD's cumulative return (77.3%) lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return (85.4%) by 8.1 percentage points.  This places it at the 15.4th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-30.8% to 116.8%).

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows varying performance across different periods.  While consistently exhibiting a positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), indicating skillful management,  the beta (volatility relative to the market) is also considerable and fluctuates.  The significant negative CAGR (-86% and -51%) in the most recent periods warrants close attention. The high equity suggests financial stability, though ROE remains relatively low.  The market capitalization shows significant growth over the analyzed period.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data contains inconsistencies (duplicate entries).  A reliable analysis requires consistent, accurate data.  The provided data shows growth in both EPS and revenue, although the duplication makes analysis difficult.


| 날짜       | EPS | 매출         |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| 2025-02-14 | 1.38 | 2.20 B$     |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | 2.04 B$     |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.93 | 2.01 B$     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is steadily increasing, along with a relatively stable high profit margin.  However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is low, suggesting that the company may not be efficiently utilizing its equity to generate profits.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.20B | 76.39% |
| 2024-09-30 | $2.04B | 76.00% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE    |

| 2024-12-31 | $53.95B   | 2.37%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $53.07B   | 1.90%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $53.35B   | 1.61%  |

| 2023-12-31 | $53.18B   | 1.19%  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD shows mixed signals. While exhibiting consistent positive alpha in most periods and strong revenue growth with high profit margins, the recent negative CAGR, low ROE, and sharp price decline raise concerns. The high expected return is dubious without a clear explanation of its calculation.  The current bearish price action and medium-risk MRI suggest caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and a more detailed analysis of the provided financial data (especially addressing inconsistencies) are crucial before making an investment decision.  The relatively high equity suggests a degree of financial stability despite other concerns.
