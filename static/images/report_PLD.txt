**Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:**

*   **Alpha:**  PLD consistently generated positive alpha in most periods, indicating outperformance relative to its benchmark.  However, recent years (2022-2025) show negative alpha, suggesting underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are relatively low, suggesting PLD has not been highly correlated with the S&P 500's movements, and recently Beta is getting higher.
*   **CAGR:** High CAGRs in earlier periods reflect strong growth. The recent negative CAGR is a concern.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate significant volatility and potential risk.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization generally increased over the period, but has shown some recent fluctuation.

### 2. Recent Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** 110.55
*   **Previous Close:** 109.23
*   **Price Change:** 1.21
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 109.48
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 104.87
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 108.59

**Analysis:**

The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. The price change from the previous close is relatively small.  The 20-day moving average being significantly lower than the 60-day moving average might indicate a recent upward trend, but this trend should be observed over time.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.347 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 71.58 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.88
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7 (Short-term Decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 181.2%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Indicates a low-risk environment for the overall market.
*   **RSI:** The RSI value suggests that PLD is currently overbought, which might indicate a potential pullback in the short term.
*   **PPO:** The Positive Price Oscillator (PPO) indicates the percentage that a 12-day exponential moving average (EMA) is above a 26-day EMA. Generally, a PPO reading above zero suggests bullish momentum.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** A negative change suggests short-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** A high expected return suggests significant potential for long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500, given a long-term investment horizon (2+ years). However, high expected returns should be treated with caution and considered alongside other risk factors. The recent price change of 1.21 may not warrant consideration of "변동 이슈" (volatility issues) by itself, but it should be noted in conjunction with recent news indicating "notable volatility".

### 7. Overall Summary

Prologis Inc. (PLD) has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent performance indicators suggest a potential shift in momentum. While long-term expected returns remain high, several factors warrant caution:

*   **Recent Underperformance:** Negative alpha and a recent decrease in relative divergence indicate underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in recent periods.
*   **Overbought Condition:** The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought in the short term.
*   **Declining Earnings & Profitability:** The most recent earnings report and financial data show a decrease in EPS, profit margin, and ROE, potentially signaling challenges.
*   **Market Volatility:** Recent news points to increased stock volatility, emphasizing the need for careful monitoring.
*   **High Expected Return:**  While attractive, the high expected return should be viewed in the context of the identified risks.

**Conclusion:**

PLD remains a potentially attractive investment given its history of outperformance and strong long-term growth prospects. However, investors should carefully consider the recent shift in momentum, monitor key indicators (especially earnings and profitability), and manage risk accordingly. The stock might be overbought, and a pullback could be an opportunity to re-evaluate the investment. Further due diligence is recommended to understand the drivers behind the recent negative trends.
