## Prologis Inc. (PLD) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Prologis Inc. (PLD) is a leading global owner, operator, and developer of logistics facilities.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, though recent trends suggest a potential recovery.


**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **PLD Cumulative Return:** 93.52%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 121.84%
* **Return Difference (PLD vs. VOO):** -28.3%  This indicates PLD underperformed VOO by 28.3% at the end of the measured period.  The relative divergence of -13% suggests that this underperformance is relatively lower than the minimum divergence observed historically (-51.8%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta data show high volatility in performance and risk (beta) over time. While Alpha (excess return relative to the market) is generally positive, indicating outperformance, the periods of substantial negative CAGR and significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) reveal considerable risk.  Note the exceptionally high MDDs in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $120.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $118.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $112.61

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.78 (Slightly below neutral; not significantly overbought or oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.06 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +1.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 252.6% (This is a high expected return;  consider the inherent uncertainty in such long-term projections and the substantial risk noted in the alpha/beta analysis.)

The positive relative divergence change despite the negative PPO suggests a potential bullish divergence, indicating that the price might be preparing for a further upward movement. The very high expected return needs to be interpreted cautiously given the inherent volatility of the stock.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entries for 2025-02-14).  Assuming the duplicates are errors, we see a generally upward trend in EPS and revenue, but the data is insufficient for a thorough analysis without more complete and consistent information.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2025-02-14 | 1.38 | 2.20 B$        |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | 2.04 B$        |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.93 | 2.01 B$        |


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  More data is needed to assess the company's financial health and profitability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD has shown significant underperformance against the S&P 500 over the given period, although its recent performance shows potential for recovery.  The high expected return should be viewed with caution due to the stock's high volatility and considerable risk as evidenced by its past maximum drawdowns.  The lack of comprehensive financial data prevents a full assessment of the company's financial health.  Further investigation is needed into the inconsistent earnings data.  Before making any investment decisions, a more thorough analysis using complete financial data and a deeper understanding of the underlying market conditions is crucial.  Consider consulting a financial advisor.
