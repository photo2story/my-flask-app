2024-11-26 - Analysis Report
## Prologis Inc. (PLD) Stock Report

This report analyzes Prologis Inc. (PLD), a leading global owner, operator, and developer of logistics facilities, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Prologis' cumulative return (96.94%) lags behind the S&P 500's (127.58%) by 30.64 percentage points as of the last data point.  The relative underperformance compared to the historical range (max: 139.45%, min: -36.35%) is at the 3.25 percentile. This indicates that Prologis has underperformed the S&P 500 in this specific period but not dramatically so relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Closing Price:** $115.8 (Last Market: $119.1)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $114.82
* **20-day Moving Average:** $114.65
* **60-day Moving Average:** $121.18

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The recent drop from $119.1 to $115.8 might be a minor correction within a broader trend.  Further analysis is needed to confirm this.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (55.36):**  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The market is relatively neutral.
* **PPO (0.34):** A positive value suggests a bullish momentum, although it is not particularly strong.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (0.21):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend.

The expected return of 0.0% for the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 suggests a neutral outlook concerning outperformance.  This should be interpreted cautiously given that it does not incorporate risk.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-25 | $1.08    | $2.04 B       |
| 2024-07-26 | $0.93    | $2.01 B       |
| 2024-04-25 | $0.63    | $1.96 B       |
| 2024-02-13 | $0.68    | $1.89 B       |
| 2023-10-27 | $0.81    | $1.91 B       |

Revenue has remained relatively stable, showing slight growth. EPS shows some fluctuation.  More information, including analyst estimates for the most recent quarter, is needed for a thorough assessment.  A comparison to previous years' results would also provide more context.

**5. Financial Information:**

1. **Revenue and Profitability:**  Shows consistently high profit margins (72.76% - 76.00%), indicating strong profitability.  Revenue is relatively stable, but this needs context of the market growth to be evaluated properly.

2. **Capital and Profitability:** ROE fluctuates but generally remains positive, suggesting a reasonable return on equity. This figure would be further strengthened with a comparison to industry benchmarks.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

(This section requires access to real-time news sources like Shacknews and Finbold.  Please provide recent news articles on PLD for a comprehensive analysis.  The absence of specific news affects the accuracy of the outlook.)  Information on recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights is essential to complete this section.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Prologis has demonstrated strong profitability and relatively stable revenue. However, its recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook, but the long-term outlook (relative to the S&P 500) is currently considered neutral based on limited information provided.  Missing data on the most recent earnings and lack of recent news articles significantly limits the ability to formulate a strong overall assessment.  More comprehensive data including analyst forecasts and comparison to industry averages will enhance the assessment.  The recent drop in price might present a buying opportunity, but further investigation is required to assess the underlying cause of the price movement.

**8. Recommendations:**

The information provided is insufficient for a strong buy/sell/hold recommendation.  To improve this report:

* **Provide the latest earnings report including analyst expectations.** This allows for a more accurate assessment of the recent financial performance.
* **Include relevant news articles** to gauge market sentiment and identify any recent events impacting PLD's stock price.
* **Specify the timeframe for the cumulative returns** to understand the historical context.
* **Compare PLD's key financial metrics (e.g., ROE, profit margin) against industry benchmarks.** This will provide a more meaningful comparison and reveal relative strength or weakness.


With additional information, a more robust and comprehensive analysis can be conducted.
