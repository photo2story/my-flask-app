## Prologis Inc. (PLD) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Prologis Inc. (PLD) is a leading global real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in logistics and distribution facilities.  Over the period reviewed, PLD's cumulative return (90.56%) lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (122.83%) by 32.3 percentage points.  This places it at the 10.8th percentile of the historical range of divergence between PLD and the S&P 500, indicating relatively underperformance compared to the broader market during this timeframe.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows highly variable performance across different time periods.  The high beta (110) consistently indicates significantly higher volatility than the market.  While certain periods show strong alpha (outperformance), others like 2022-2024 show extremely negative returns.  This highlights the inherent risk associated with this stock.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $118.54
* **5-day Moving Average:** $114.27
* **20-day Moving Average:** $107.83
* **60-day Moving Average:** $111.07

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  The recent price change of +2.96% indicates a positive short-term momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 71.70  (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.54 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +6.1% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 328.2% (A very high projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500, considering potential volatility needs to be considered)


The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought in the short term, potentially indicating a near-term correction.  However, the positive PPO and the recent price increase support the bullish momentum. The substantial projected excess return requires further investigation and consideration of risk associated with the high volatility.
