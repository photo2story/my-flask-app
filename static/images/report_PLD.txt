**6.  Overall Analysis:**

PLD has historically shown strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent performance indicates a significant downward trend, reflected in the low RSI, negative PPO, and price movement below all moving averages. While the long-term expected return remains high, the current market risk is high, and recent negative CAGR numbers highlight substantial short-term risk.  More complete and consistent data, along with a deeper investigation into the causes behind the recent downturn, are crucial for a more robust and reliable assessment.  Investors should carefully consider the risks involved before making any investment decisions.  The high relative divergence in the past doesn't guarantee future outperformance.
