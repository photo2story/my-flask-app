## Prologis Inc. (PLD) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Prologis Inc. (PLD) is a leading global provider of logistics real estate.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), PLD's cumulative return is significantly lower.  While VOO achieved a cumulative return of 121.09%, PLD's cumulative return stands at 93.95%. This represents a difference of -27.1 percentage points.  Considering the historical range of divergence (max: 129.3%, min: -51.8%), the current divergence of -27.1% places it at the 13.6th percentile relative to past performance.  This suggests PLD has underperformed VOO recently, but the degree of underperformance is not extreme considering its historical context.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows that PLD consistently exhibits a positive alpha (ranging from 0.1) indicating that it has generally outperformed the market benchmark, albeit slightly, across different periods. However, its high beta (ranging between 46.5 and 143.2) indicates higher volatility than the market. Notably, the recent years (2022-2025) show significantly negative CAGR, suggesting substantial market corrections have affected the company's performance. The massive MDD (-139%) in the 2022-2024 period highlights the risk associated with this investment.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $120.65
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $120.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $111.54
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $111.50

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.  The price is also significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term uptrend.  The recent price increase from the previous close ($119.17 to $120.65)  represents a positive change, and does not suggest a sudden, dramatic price jump.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (74.55):**  Indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (1.19):** A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (2.8+):** Shows a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (246.7%):** This signifies a substantial projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this prediction needs cautious interpretation, as it's highly dependent on future market conditions and may not be a guaranteed outcome.  The high volatility of PLD (indicated by high Beta) makes this forecast less reliable.

**7. Overall Summary:**

PLD shows positive growth in revenue and earnings, with consistently high profit margins. However, its high beta indicates significant volatility, as shown by the recent negative CAGR and extreme maximum drawdown.  While the high expected return is promising, the high beta and approaching overbought RSI suggest caution. The low ROE might indicate less efficient capital usage compared to other investments. A long-term investment in PLD might be considered, but a thorough risk assessment is crucial given its volatility. Further investigation into the reasons for the recent negative CAGR is essential before making any investment decisions.  The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the recent past should be carefully considered.
