## Prologis Inc. (PLD) Stock Review

**0. Overview:**

Prologis Inc. (PLD) is a leading global logistics real estate investment trust (REIT).

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PLD's cumulative return is 91.69%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 119.91%.  Therefore, PLD underperformed VOO by 28.22 percentage points as of the last data point.  The relative divergence (-28.2) places it in the 13th percentile of its historical performance range relative to VOO (ranging from -51.8% to +129.3%).


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods.  Alpha, representing excess return over the market (VOO), generally remains positive but varies significantly, from 0.1 to 0.9. The Beta, measuring market sensitivity, also fluctuates but tends to be high (above 40), indicating higher volatility compared to the overall market.  The significant increase in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and simultaneous increase in MDD (Maximum Drawdown) in the 2019-2021 period suggests a period of high growth accompanied by considerable risk. The very negative CAGR in 2022-2024 highlights substantial losses in that time period.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) also generally exhibits growth, though it fluctuates slightly alongside market conditions.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 40.0% | 4.4% | 0.1 | 49.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 27.0% | 10.9% | 0.2 | 46.5 |
| 2017-2019  | 64.0% | 10.9% | 0.5 | 72.4 |
| 2018-2020  | 45.0% | 10.9% | 0.3 | 83.1 |
| 2019-2021  | 154.0% | 8.4% | 0.3 | 143.2 |
| 2020-2022  | 6.0% | 20.1% | 0.3 | 98.3 |
| 2021-2023  | 25.0% | 20.1% | 0.8 | 119.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $119.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $120.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $112.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $111.61

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent downward pressure. However, it sits significantly above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend in the medium to long term. The last day's closing price shows a small decrease (-1.16%) compared to the previous close.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.81 (High, indicating potentially overbought conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.95 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +1.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 259.7% (Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term is projected, but requires further investigation to validate)

The high RSI suggests caution, implying a potential short-term correction. The positive PPO and upward relative divergence, combined with higher moving averages support the long-term growth potential, especially considering the 259.7% expected return. The negative daily change (-1.16%) is not significant enough to be considered a sharp decline.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD shows a mixed performance picture. While it exhibits a long-term growth potential supported by generally increasing revenue and a positive outlook regarding the long-term expected return,  its recent performance lags behind the S&P 500. The high RSI and significant historical volatility, highlighted by the large fluctuations in CAGR and MDD in the alpha and beta analysis, suggest a relatively risky investment.  Further analysis including comparisons with competitors, a detailed risk assessment, and validation of the 259.7% expected return, are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The recent earnings show a stable revenue stream with high profit margins, providing some support for the long-term potential, but this must be weighed against the recent underperformance relative to the broader market.
