High and relatively stable profit margins (70-76%) demonstrate strong profitability.

Further analysis would be needed to fully interpret these figures, including comparison to industry benchmarks and analysis of the components that drive these margins and ROE.

**9. English Report:**

This report provides a preliminary analysis of Prologis Inc. (PLD).  Further research is needed to incorporate recent news, earnings calls, and analyst opinions for a more robust conclusion.  Specifically, a lack of explicit earnings expectations prevents a thorough evaluation of the recent earnings announcement.  Furthermore, a comparative analysis with industry peers is recommended for a comprehensive understanding of PLD's financial performance and competitive positioning.  The relatively low ROE warrants additional investigation to ascertain whether this is characteristic of the industry or reflects inefficiencies within PLD's operations.  Finally, future projections would benefit from a more sophisticated model that accounts for macroeconomic factors and industry trends.
