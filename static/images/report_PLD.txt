## Prologis Inc. (PLD) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

Prologis Inc. (PLD) is a leading global real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in logistics and distribution facilities.  The analysis below examines its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key indicators, earnings, and financial information.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

PLD's cumulative return (119.67%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (76.31%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 43.4%, placing it at the 34.7th percentile of the historical range of performance differences (max: 146.7%, min: -11.4%).  This suggests PLD has historically exhibited higher returns than the S&P 500, but its current outperformance is not at the extreme end of its historical range.

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance characteristics over different periods.  While Alpha is generally positive, indicating outperformance, Beta fluctuates significantly, suggesting substantial sensitivity to market movements (especially during 2019-2021 and 2022-2025). The large market capitalization also indicates its stability.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $99.95
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $99.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $102.42
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $112.59

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some potential downward pressure.  It's significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a more substantial downward trend over the longer term.  The recent 1.34 increase from the previous close shows a minor rebound after a potential downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.83 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** 0.437 (Positive, indicating potential bullishness)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +1.6 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** 164.3% (significant excess return over S&P 500 projected over 2+ years)

The combination of indicators presents a mixed signal.  While RSI suggests bearishness, the positive PPO and recent upward momentum in relative divergence counter this. The high expected return is a promising long-term outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicates.  A more complete and accurate dataset is needed for thorough analysis. However, revenue shows a generally upward trend, albeit with some quarter-to-quarter variation.  The EPS figures also indicate a growing trend with some variability.   Further clarification on the duplicated entries is required for a reliable assessment.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue    |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-02-14 | 1.38 | $2.20 B    |
| 2024-10-25 | 1.08 | $2.04 B    |
| 2025-02-14 | 1.08 | $2.04 B    |
| 2024-07-26 | 0.93 | $2.01 B    |
| 2025-02-14 | 0.93 | $2.01 B    |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows a strong and consistent revenue growth trend, along with high and relatively stable profit margins. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is relatively low and inconsistent, which might warrant further investigation into the capital allocation and efficiency of the company.

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity    | ROE   |
|-------------|----------|---------------|------------|-------|
| 2024-12-31  | $2.20B   | 76.39%        | $53.95B   | 2.37% |
| 2024-09-30  | $2.04B   | 76.00%        | $53.07B   | 1.90% |
| 2024-06-30  | $2.01B   | 74.31%        | $53.35B   | 1.61% |
| 2024-03-31  | $1.96B   | 72.76%        | $53.19B   | 1.10% |
| 2023-12-31  | $1.89B   | 74.22%        | $53.18B   | 1.19% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PLD demonstrates a history of strong performance relative to the S&P 500. While recent price action shows some weakness, the relatively high expected return and positive long-term growth prospects remain attractive.  However, inconsistencies in the provided earnings data and relatively low and volatile ROE figures require further investigation. A comprehensive analysis necessitates a more complete and consistent data set, including a deeper dive into the company's financial statements and industry trends.  The data suggests a potentially strong long-term investment, but caution is advised given the recent price movement and the need for more complete financial data.
