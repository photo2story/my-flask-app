**Key Considerations:**

Given the recent negative price action, high Maximum Drawdown, and news indicating volatility, investors should exercise caution.  Further research into the "major business developments, regulatory changes, or market events" mentioned in the news is crucial. A conservative approach would be to wait for a stabilization of the price and confirmation of positive momentum before considering new positions. Investors should also carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon, given the ETF's volatile nature and potential for significant losses.
