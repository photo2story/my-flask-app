**Analysis:**

*   The negative PPO supports the short-term downtrend.
*   The negative Delta of Relative Divergence confirms that MSTY's recent performance has been lagging VOO.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a move to increase cash holdings, indicating a defensive stance.
*   The `change` is -0.93%, reflecting a slight decrease in price compared to the previous closing price. This reinforces the short-term downward trend indicated by the moving averages.
*   The NaN for Expected Return is a concern; it suggests that the model could not calculate a reasonable estimate.

The recent signals suggest caution, and further monitoring is warranted. The lack of an "Expected Return" is concerning and requires further investigation. Due to recent news reports of business developments, regulatory changes, or market events as well as analyst's discussion of MSTY's recent performance, it is highly recommended to monitor for the long term.
