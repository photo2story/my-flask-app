## MSTY (YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF) Analysis

**Company Overview:** MSTY is an ETF that seeks to generate income through options strategies tied to MicroStrategy (MSTR).

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

*   **MSTY Cumulative Return:** 33.33%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 23.71%
*   **Absolute Difference:** 9.62%
*   **Deviation (Max: 61.4, Min: -18.3, Current: 12.8, Relative Deviation: 39.0)**

**Analysis:** MSTY has outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in cumulative return.  However, the relative deviation of 39.0 indicates that while MSTY is currently outperforming VOO, it is not at the extreme high end of its historical outperformance range.  The deviation range suggests significant volatility in the past relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2023-2025  | 33.0%   | 69.3%   | 10.0%  | -0.0  | 5.8    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 33.0% is a strong growth rate, significantly exceeding typical market returns.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 69.3% is extremely high. This indicates a very high level of risk and potential for significant losses.
*   **Alpha:** 10.0% suggests that MSTY has generated returns above what would be expected based on market movements alone, though not adjusted to the high MDD.
*   **Beta:** The beta of -0.0 implies that MSTY has almost no correlation with the overall market (S&P 500). This is unusual and likely due to the fund's options strategy.
*   **Cap(B):** With the 5.8 Billion market cap, liquidity can be a factor.

*   **Expected Return (%):** NaN

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.3234 suggests that the risk is in the medium range.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 33.21 indicates that the asset is approaching oversold conditions, suggesting a potential for a price rebound.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO value indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, which could signal a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests reducing holdings and increasing cash. The cautionary note with the MRI value suggests some level of market risk that is concerning.
*   **Recent Deviation Change:** The recent decline in relative deviation aligns with the price action showing a short-term downtrend.
*   **Last Market Data:** The 0.89% price decrease is significant.
*   **Expected Return:**  The "NaN" for expected return makes it impossible to evaluate whether there are opportunities to achieve excess return relative to S&P500 for long-term investment.
