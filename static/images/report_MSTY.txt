## YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) Report

This report analyzes the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY), an ETF employing an options income strategy focused on MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

MSTY achieved a cumulative return of 28.24% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 9.06%.  This represents a difference of 19.2 percentage points. The relative divergence of 39.9% indicates MSTY's performance is significantly higher than the S&P 500, placing it in the upper quartile of its historical performance range relative to VOO.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows strong performance characteristics:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2023-2025  | 28.0% | 71.9% | 19.0% | 2.0 |


A high Alpha (19.0%) suggests MSTY significantly outperforms the market, while a Beta of 2.0 indicates higher volatility than the market (twice as volatile).  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 71.9% highlights the significant risk associated with this ETF.  The high Beta and MDD should be carefully considered.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $20.37
* **Last Market Price:** $20.33 (a decrease of $0.04 or -0.2% from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $22.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $20.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $22.16

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. The recent price decrease of $0.04 (-0.2%) is relatively minor and doesn't signal a significant event.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4368 (Medium Risk) – Indicates a moderate level of risk.
* **RSI:** 65.44 – Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70), suggesting potential for a near-term price correction.
* **PPO:** 1.33 – Positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.5% – Indicates a recent decrease in relative strength against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** nan (not provided).  Long-term (2+ years) investment could yield substantial returns compared to the S&P 500 based on past performance, but this is not a guarantee and considerable risk exists given the high Beta and MDD.


**Conclusion:**

MSTY has demonstrated high returns exceeding the S&P 500 significantly. However,  investors should be aware of its high volatility and risk, as evidenced by the high Beta and MDD. The current price is slightly below its moving averages, and the RSI suggests potential for a short-term correction.  While the long-term potential is promising based on historical data,  the lack of an explicit expected return and the significant risk should be carefully considered before investing.  Further due diligence is recommended before any investment decisions.
