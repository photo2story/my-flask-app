**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2023-2025  | 38.0% | 69.3% | 12.0% | -0.1  | 5.2    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 38.0% indicates a strong annual growth rate.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 69.3% suggests very high risk.
*   **Alpha:** 12.0% indicates MSTY has generated 12% more return than expected for the risk taken, indicating a substantial level of outperformance.
*   **Beta:** -0.1 suggests that MSTY has a negative correlation with the market, meaning it tends to move in the opposite direction of the market.
*   **Cap(B):** 5.2, meaning a market cap of 5.2 Billion dollars.

The high CAGR is attractive, but the MDD highlights significant downside risk.  The positive alpha is good, but the negative beta should be carefully considered in portfolio construction.

*   **60-day Moving Average:** $21.90

**Analysis:**

The current price shows a slight increase compared to the previous close.

The larger the difference between the moving average numbers, the stronger the indication of the downward trend.

*   **PPO:** -0.78

*   **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.8 (Negative = Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** NaN

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.3349 indicates a Low Risk environment.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 36.09 suggests the asset is not oversold, but is relatively close to being oversold.
*   **PPO:** The PPO of -0.78 indicates that the recent prices are generally lower than their historical average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends a high cash position (66%) and selling a small portion (5.8%) of holdings. This, combined with the "Caution" message and the MRI, suggests a conservative approach due to perceived risks, even though the MRI itself indicates low market risk.
*   **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change of -6.8 in relative divergence indicates a short-term underperformance compared to VOO.
*   **Price Change Reflection:** The slight increase in price from the previous day, while positive, doesn't negate the overall downward trend suggested by the moving averages and divergence change.
*   **Expected Return:** The NaN value for expected return means that the model couldn't reliably predict the long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500.
