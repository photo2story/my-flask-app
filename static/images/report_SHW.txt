SHW has demonstrated strong performance compared to the S&P 500, with a positive outperformance over the reviewed period.

The technical indicators also point to a somewhat overbought condition, but this is not necessarily a cause for concern given the strong fundamentals. The expected return of 38.07% over 5 years offers a potentially attractive investment prospect. Overall, SHW appears to be a solid company with continued growth potential, though further research is recommended to assess individual risk tolerance and investment goals.
