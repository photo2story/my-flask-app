## BTC-USD Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

BTC-USD, representing Bitcoin, is a decentralized digital currency.  The provided data shows significantly higher cumulative returns for BTC-USD compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with substantial volatility and periods of both extreme gains and losses.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **BTC-USD Cumulative Return:** 6437.45%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 121.84%
* **Return Difference:** 6315.6%  (This is a substantial difference, highlighting Bitcoin's significantly higher returns, although with considerably higher risk, as evidenced by the high maximum drawdown.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 89.2% (This indicates that the current return difference is in the top 90% of historical return differences between BTC-USD and VOO.  It does *not* imply 90% outperformance.)

The historical alpha and beta values provided in the table demonstrate that Bitcoinâ€™s returns are highly uncorrelated with the market (high alpha, changing beta), making it a risky asset with unpredictable performance relative to the S&P 500.  The high CAGR figures should be viewed cautiously in light of the substantial maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The large swings in beta and the negative CAGR in 2021-2023 further highlight the volatile nature of this investment.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $96,478.75
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $96,809.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $99,477.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $98,747.45

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price change of -1.42% indicates a slight downward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 31.13  (This suggests the asset is currently in oversold territory, potentially signaling a buying opportunity for some investors, but this should be taken with caution in light of the substantial volatility of the asset.)
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.41 (A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 794.2% (This represents a substantial potential excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, but carries considerable risk given Bitcoin's historically high volatility.  Past performance is not indicative of future results).

**Overall Assessment:**

Bitcoin has demonstrated exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500 historically, but this comes with incredibly high risk and volatility. The current indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend, although the RSI suggests the asset might be oversold.  The high expected return should be considered within the context of substantial risk. A long-term investment approach (2+ years) might be suitable for investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon who understand the volatility inherent in this asset class.  However, it's crucial to conduct thorough due diligence and carefully consider personal risk tolerance before investing in Bitcoin.  The high maximum drawdowns from the historical data should not be ignored.
