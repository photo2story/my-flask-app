2025-04-04 - Analysis Report
## BTC-USD Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:**

BTC-USD, representing Bitcoin, is a decentralized digital currency.  The provided data shows significant volatility and high returns compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), although recent performance has been negative relative to its past performance.  Key indicators suggest a moderately risky investment with a potentially high long-term reward, but significant short-term price fluctuations are expected.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shows a cumulative return of 5654.73%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 85.44%. The divergence between the two assets is substantial (currently at 5569.3, representing the 78.9th percentile of historical divergence).  The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows exceptionally high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) in several periods, highlighting Bitcoin's potential for substantial returns, but also substantial periods of negative returns (e.g., 2021-2023) and high maximum drawdown (MDD).  The beta values, while fluctuating, indicate a low to moderate correlation with the overall market, especially when considering the high magnitude of returns.  The large market capitalization (Cap(B)) across the periods shows the growing adoption and interest in the asset.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

As of the report's date:

* **Closing Price:** $82,865.96
* **5-day Moving Average:** $83,080.86
* **20-day Moving Average:** $84,503.61
* **60-day Moving Average:** $89,294.52

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  The recent price change (0.44%) indicates a minor increase from the previous close but is not significant enough to classify it as a sharp movement.


**3) Technical Indicators & Risk Assessment:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk) indicating moderate risk.
* **RSI:** 45.83, suggesting the asset is nearing oversold territory, potentially a buying opportunity for some investors.
* **PPO:** 0.0026, close to neutral, providing little directional insight.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.8%, indicating a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return:** 1180.6%. This represents a substantial projected excess return over the S&P 500 in a long-term (2+ years) investment scenario.

**Conclusion:**

Bitcoin's historical performance displays exceptional growth potential but significant risk due to its volatility. The recent price action shows a minor upward trend but remains below key moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish bias.  The relatively low RSI and moderate MRI imply a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high-risk tolerance, however,  the significant historical MDD highlights the potential for substantial losses. The high expected return coupled with the significant historical volatility should be carefully considered when evaluating this investment.
