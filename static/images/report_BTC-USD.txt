**Analyst Opinions**

Analyst Consensus:


**Comprehensive Analysis (Summary of previous items, including news)**
Bitcoin's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500, but the market risk indicator (MRI) indicates a medium to high risk investment. The recent price fluctuations show a slight upward trend, but the RSI and PPO indices indicate a potential sell signal. However, it is essential to consider the recent news and significant events, including concerns about FOMC meetings and sentiment on Bitcoin, before making any investment decisions. With an expected return of 1280.20% and an expected excess return compared to the S&P 500, investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards.
