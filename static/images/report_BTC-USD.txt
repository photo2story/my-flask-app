## BTC-USD Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:**

BTC-USD, representing Bitcoin, is a decentralized digital currency.  The provided data shows significant volatility and high returns compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), though recent performance has been negative.  Key indicators suggest a moderate risk profile at present.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The cumulative return for BTC-USD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO) at 6399.28% vs 71.02%.  The current divergence, while large (6328.3), is positioned at the 67.9th percentile of historical divergence between the two assets. This indicates that while significantly outperforming VOO historically, the current relative outperformance is not at its most extreme level.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals highly volatile performance, with extremely high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) interspersed with periods of substantial negative returns (-599% CAGR from 2021-2023). Beta values fluctuate significantly. This extreme volatility is expected for such an asset class.  The historically high alpha values further highlight significant outperformance but needs to be interpreted carefully due to the high beta and the risk associated with that.

* **Closing Price:** 83965.83
* **Last Market Price:** 83843.27

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4782 (High Risk category) indicating elevated market uncertainty.
* **RSI:** 49.77 (near neutral territory, neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.0855 (slightly positive, suggesting some bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.7 (short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return:** 2318.8% (This represents significant potential for outperformance over the S&P 500 over a 2+ year timeframe, but the high volatility and associated risk should be carefully considered.)


**Overall:**

BTC-USD shows a history of spectacular returns but also significant risk. The current market price sits below key moving averages and the MRI signals high risk.  While the expected return is high, potential for significant drawdowns must be factored in.  Investors should have a high risk tolerance and understand that the historical performance is not indicative of future results.  Further analysis, considering individual risk tolerance and investment goals, is strongly advised before making investment decisions.
