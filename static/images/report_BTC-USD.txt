* **Expected Return:** 2442.2% (This is a very high expected return, significantly exceeding the S&P 500's potential return, and should be viewed with caution).

The slight negative price change in the last market update doesn't indicate a significant event like a sharp drop or surge.  However, the high risk indicated by the MRI and the high expected return emphasize the volatility inherent in this asset.  The high expected return should be considered alongside the high risk associated with BTC-USD before making investment decisions.  Long-term investment requires careful consideration of risk tolerance.
