**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 101048.296875 (Last market: 101422.58)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 99263.1594
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 97307.3914
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 82844.8897

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend in the short-to-medium term.  The relatively small gap between the last market price and the closing price suggests stability.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.58 –  Slightly above neutral (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** -0.71 – Negative value indicates bearish momentum, though relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.1 – Indicates a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 3302.1% – This represents a significant potential for exceeding S&P 500 returns over the long term.  However,  this projection is highly uncertain given Bitcoin's volatility.  The 101422.58 price is not significantly higher than the closing price, so no significant recent jump is evident.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Bitcoin has demonstrated exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500 historically,  but this comes with extreme volatility.  Current indicators show a modestly bullish short-term outlook, with the price above its moving averages. However, the negative PPO suggests some bearish momentum. The long-term potential remains significant, but the substantial risk associated with Bitcoin's price swings must be carefully considered.  The high expected return should be viewed with caution due to its dependence on past performance, which is not indicative of future results.  A detailed analysis of current market news is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
