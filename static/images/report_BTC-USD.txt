2024-12-01 - Analysis Report
## Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Investment Report

**1. Performance Analysis & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

The cumulative return of BTC-USD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 8621.78% for BTC-USD versus 130.06% for VOO.  This represents a substantial divergence. While the relative divergence metric suggests the current performance is in the upper 98.4th percentile of its historical range compared to VOO, this doesn't negate the inherent volatility of Bitcoin.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) from the table shows extreme volatility, ranging from massive gains to significant losses year over year.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $97,468.72 (Last Market: $96,904.02)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $94,834.27
* **20-day Moving Average:** $92,556.36
* **60-day Moving Average:** $75,559.58

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish short-term trend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the last market price indicates minimal immediate volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 63.36 -  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions, suggesting a neutral short-term trend.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.84 -  Suggests a bearish momentum, potentially indicating a short-term downward correction.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (-) -  Indicates a recent short-term decline in relative performance.

The expected return of 4237.5% over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, compared to the S&P 500, highlights the potential for substantial outperformance but also underscores the significant risk involved.  This high expected return is likely driven by the historical volatility and past performance of BTC, but past performance is not indicative of future results.  The fact that the last market price ($96,904.02) is not significantly different from the closing price suggests there's no recent dramatic price swing (neither a sharp rebound nor a crash).

Bitcoin's performance has historically outpaced the S&P 500 significantly, but this comes with extreme volatility.

The large divergence from the S&P 500 highlights the risk and reward inherent in Bitcoin investments.  The current price is above its moving averages suggesting a positive short-term trend, but the negative PPO suggests a potential bearish momentum.
