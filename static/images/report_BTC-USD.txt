2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided data for Bitcoin (BTC-USD) compared to the S&P 500 (VOO):

**1. Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** BTC-USD (Bitcoin)
*   **Company Overview:** Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
*   **Bitcoin Cumulative Return:** 1940.48%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 91.40%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 1849.1
    *   Relative Divergence: 67.3% (meaning the current divergence is in the top 67.3% of its historical range)

**Analysis:** Bitcoin has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 by a large margin. The relative divergence indicates this outperformance is substantial, but not at its absolute peak compared to its historical range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B)   |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|------|----------|
| 2016-2018  | 238.0%   | 91.1%  | 234.0%   | 0.3  | 74.9     |
| 2017-2019  | 258.0%   | 91.1%  | 241.0%   | 0.3  | 144.0    |
| 2018-2020  | 277.0%   | 82.6%  | 256.0%   | 0.7  | 580.5    |
| 2019-2021  | 1570.0%  | 64.2%  | 1526.0%  | 0.9  | 927.0    |
| 2020-2022  | 250.0%   | 71.6%  | 252.0%   | 1.1  | 331.2    |
| 2021-2023  | -205.0%  | 71.6%  | -206.0%  | 1.3  | 846.1    |
| 2022-2024  | 972.0%   | 57.8%  | 952.0%   | 1.3  | 1870.2   |
| 2023-2025  | 925.0%   | 33.8%  | 863.0%   | 0.9  | 1751.7   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth over the period. High CAGR values show periods of rapid growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. High MDD values suggest high volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the investment's performance above a benchmark (in this case, likely the S&P 500).  High positive alpha indicates strong outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Measures the investment's volatility relative to the market. A beta of 1 means it moves in line with the market, greater than 1 means more volatile, and less than 1 means less volatile. Bitcoin generally has a relatively low beta compared to its volatility, which indicates that the performance is independent of the market's movement.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in Billions.

**Analysis:**

*   Bitcoin shows periods of very high growth (high CAGR), but also significant drawdowns (high MDD). This is typical for a volatile asset.
*   The high Alpha values suggest that Bitcoin's performance is largely independent of the market, driven by its own factors.
*   The Beta values have fluctuated.
*   The recent years (2022-2025) still show very high CAGR and Alpha.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 88568.01
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 88778.7, 'previousClose': 88725.47, 'change': 0.06}
*   **5-day SMA:** 87895.50
*   **20-day SMA:** 87614.10
*   **60-day SMA:** 91567.08

**Analysis:** The short-term moving averages (5-day, 20-day) are below the 60-day SMA, which suggests the price has experienced correction in recent days. The very recent price increase ('change': 0.06) is not significant.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 53.38 (Neutral)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.34 (Slightly Bullish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (19 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.2 (+) (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 3390.63%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, indicating a moderate level of risk.
*   The RSI is near the middle (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   The PPO being slightly above zero hints at a slightly bullish trend.
*   The recommendation to invest 100% of cash suggests confidence.
*   The expected return is very high, indicating potentially very strong long-term gains.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Volatility:** Mentions of a brief $90K spike and slides suggest volatility.
*   **Macro Factors:** Focus on a "2026 Macro Reset" indicates broader economic conditions are being considered.
*   **Correlation with Stocks:**  "Bitcoin Is Set for First Yearly Split From Stocks in Decade" is significant. This suggests Bitcoin is increasingly acting as its own asset class, less tied to traditional stock market movements.
*   **Crypto Stock Impact:** News about Coinbase, Robinhood, and miners being affected by crypto slump suggests potential indirect exposure and interconnectedness.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions (consensus / targets / recent changes):**
*Analyst Consensus: N/A

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Bitcoin shows high growth potential, but comes with significant volatility. While the asset has a high expected return, the MDD and recent news headlines indicate significant risks. The technical indicators suggest a moderately bullish outlook, but the price is currently below its 60-day moving average.

**Summary and Recommendations:**

*   **High Risk, High Reward:** Bitcoin remains a high-risk, high-reward investment.
*   **Monitor Macro Conditions:** Be aware of broader economic conditions and their potential impact on Bitcoin.
