*   **BTC-USD (Bitcoin):**
    *   Current Price: 87873.5625
    *   5-day SMA: 87754.6562
    *   20-day SMA: 87715.566
    *   60-day SMA: 92149.96
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 87818.17
    *   Previous Close: 87512.875
    *   Change: 0.35%
*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 65.52
*   **PPO:** 0.2985
*   **Expected Return:** 3612.4% (Over 2 years)

**Simple Analysis:**

*   Bitcoin's price is fluctuating around its 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). The price is trending slightly below these short term moving averages.
*   The 60-day SMA is significantly higher, suggesting a recent price decline (or a previous period of much higher prices pulling the average up).
*   The MRI of 0.9 indicates a relatively low-risk environment according to this indicator, suggesting a favorable time for investment.
*   The RSI is 65.52, approaching the overbought territory (above 70), suggesting that the asset may be overvalued and could be due for a price correction.
*   The large Expected Return suggests very high potential returns, but also a higher degree of risk (always consider that high potential returns come with high risk).

**1) Return Rate Comparison (BTC-USD vs. S&P 500 - VOO):**

*   **Bitcoin Company Overview:** A decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network.
*   **Bitcoin Cumulative Return:** 1797.91%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 0.0%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Max: 2807.9
    *   Min: -3.0
    *   Current: 1797.9
    *   Relative Divergence: 64.1%

**Analysis:** Bitcoin has vastly outperformed the S&P 500. The relative divergence of 64.1% means that the current divergence between Bitcoin's return and the S&P 500's return is positioned at the 64.1th percentile of its historical fluctuation range. This indicates the divergence isn't near its maximum, suggesting there is still room for Bitcoin to outperform.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD  | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2018-2020  | 277.0%  | 76.9% | 277.0%  | 0.7  | 578.8  |
| 2019-2021  | 1570.0% | 75.8% | 1570.0% | 0.9  | 924.2  |
| 2020-2022  | 250.0%  | 75.8% | 250.0%  | 1.1  | 330.2  |

| 2023-2025  | 798.0%  | 71.7% | 798.0%  | 0.9  | 1746.2 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows the average annual growth rate over the specified periods.  CAGR varies greatly, highlighting Bitcoin's volatility.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Represents the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  Bitcoin's MDD is substantial, indicating significant risk of large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the excess return compared to a benchmark (likely the risk-free rate, since it's the same as CAGR here). The high Alpha values suggest Bitcoin has consistently generated returns beyond what would be expected based on its risk.
*   **Beta:** Measures the volatility of Bitcoin relative to the market. A Beta consistently below 1 suggests Bitcoin is less volatile than the market overall but is still showing positive correlation.
*   **Cap(B):** Represents the market capitalization of Bitcoin in billions. It fluctuates with the price.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   Close = 87873.5625
*   Last-market = {'price': 87818.17, 'previousClose': 87512.875, 'change': 0.35}
*   5-day SMA = 87754.6562
*   20-day SMA = 87715.566
*   60-day SMA = 92149.96

**Analysis:** Bitcoin's current price is slightly above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, which can be interpreted as a short-term upward trend. However, the 60-day moving average is significantly higher, indicating that the price is still below its medium-term trend. The change of 0.35% in the last market indicates the asset price is relatively stable.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 65.52238234741523
*   **PPO:** 0.2985
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_1%_Buy 100% of cash (20 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 1% on 2025-10-26)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **If {'price': 87818.17, 'previousClose': 87512.875, 'change': 0.35} is large, reflect the fluctuation issue (sharp rebound, sharp decline).**
*   **Expected Return (%):** 3612.4

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI value is approaching overbought territory.
*   The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is positive, suggesting an upward price trend.
*   The hybrid signal suggesting a "very safe" buy is based on the relatively low MRI, but should be treated with caution given Bitcoin's inherent volatility.
*   The recent decline in relative divergence suggests that Bitcoin's outperformance compared to the S&P 500 has decreased slightly in the last 20 days.
*   The extremely high expected return should be viewed skeptically and considered alongside the high risk associated with Bitcoin.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Bitcoin Set for First Yearly Split From Stocks in Decade:** Indicates a potential shift in Bitcoin's correlation with traditional markets.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Bitcoin is currently trading around $87,873. It has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but also exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by its Maximum Drawdown (MDD). The recent news headlines suggest a complex picture: a brief price spike followed by a reversal, a potential decoupling from traditional stock markets, and a highly optimistic long-term price target.

The technical indicators present mixed signals. The MRI is high, suggesting a favorable investment environment according to this indicator. The RSI is approaching overbought territory.

**Overall, Bitcoin presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.** The potential for significant gains is undeniable, but investors should be prepared for substantial price swings and the possibility of significant losses. Due diligence and careful risk management are essential. Investors should consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals before investing in Bitcoin. The news headlines highlight the importance of staying informed about market trends and potential shifts in Bitcoin's relationship with the broader financial system. Also, remember the "Hybrid Signal" is based on the current risk assessment and can change with market conditions.
