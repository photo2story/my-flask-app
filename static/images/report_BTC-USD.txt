## BTC-USD Report

**Summary:**  BTC-USD, or Bitcoin, is a decentralized digital currency.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Bitcoin's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  While the S&P 500 shows a cumulative return of 116.34, Bitcoin boasts a staggering 5618.81 cumulative return.  This results in a substantial divergence. The provided data shows a current divergence of 5502.5, representing the 77.8th percentile of historical divergence based on the provided min/max range.  This indicates that the current level of outperformance is relatively high compared to historical observations.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high volatility and inconsistent performance for Bitcoin across different timeframes. While CAGR is impressively high in some years (exceeding 3000% in 2015-2017), it has also experienced substantial negative returns (-598% in 2021-2023).  The Alpha values suggest that Bitcoin's performance is largely independent of the market (close to zero in many periods but becoming more positive in recent years), and the Beta values reveal its significant market volatility and higher risk compared to the broad market. The market cap fluctuates considerably throughout the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 84347.02
* **Last Market Price:** 79976.28 (a significant drop of -5.54% from the previous close of 84671.16)
* **5-day Moving Average:** 91470.61
* **20-day Moving Average:** 95411.59
* **60-day Moving Average:** 97974.06

The price is currently trading significantly below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The substantial drop in the last market price indicates a recent sharp decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 19.15 – This is deeply in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO:** -1.11 –  Negative PPO confirms the bearish trend.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -11.5 – Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 1084.6% – This represents a potentially substantial long-term (2+ years) excess return relative to the S&P 500, *if* the historical high volatility and unpredictable nature of Bitcoin can be mitigated through a long-term, dollar-cost averaging investment strategy.  However, this should be treated with significant caution due to the inherently high risk involved.

**Conclusion:**

Bitcoin's performance has historically been highly volatile and uncorrelated with traditional markets.  While the current oversold RSI and extremely high past cumulative returns indicate potential for upside, the recent sharp price drop and negative technical indicators highlight the considerable risks associated with this asset.  The high expected return needs to be considered in the context of the substantial potential for losses.  Any investment decision should be based on a thorough understanding of these risks and a long-term investment horizon.  Diversification is crucial.
