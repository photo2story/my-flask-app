## Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Investment Report

**1. Performance Analysis & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

The cumulative return for BTC-USD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The final cumulative return difference between BTC-USD and VOO is 6744.7. This shows a substantial outperformance of BTC-USD compared to the S&P 500 over the period considered. However, the provided "relative divergence" metric indicates that this level of outperformance is at the upper end of historical values.  While impressive, the past performance is not necessarily indicative of future returns.  The CAGR data across different periods further highlights the extreme volatility inherent in Bitcoin. Note that the provided Alpha values of 0.0 suggest that the outperformance relative to the market is not captured by the beta. This could be explained by a very high beta.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 101169.22
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 99298.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 97535.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 84052.21

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend in the short to medium term.  However, the relatively small gap between the 5-day and 20-day averages suggests the upward momentum might be weakening.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 57.63 –  Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, indicating a relatively neutral market sentiment.
* **PPO:** -0.5661 –  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.0 (-) – Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative divergence.
* **Expected Return:** 3323.3% – This extremely high expected return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 reflects the historically high volatility and potential for both significant gains and losses.  It’s crucial to remember that this is a projection and not a guaranteed outcome.  The current price of 101169.22 does not suggest a recent sharp movement up or down.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

Bitcoin has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but this comes with significantly higher risk and volatility. While the recent price action shows a slight upward trend, the negative PPO and relative divergence suggest caution. The very high projected long-term return reflects the potential for significant upside, but also the substantial downside risk.  A long-term investment approach is generally recommended for Bitcoin, but only with a high risk tolerance.  The lack of recent news information prevents a complete assessment of current market dynamics.
