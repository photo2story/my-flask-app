## Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is a decentralized digital currency, operating independently of a central bank.  The cumulative return of BTC-USD is 6533.79%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 113.65%. The difference in cumulative returns between BTC-USD and VOO is approximately 6420.1 percentage points as of the last data point. This places the relative divergence at the 90.7th percentile of historical data, indicating a historically high level of outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this high divergence should be interpreted cautiously considering the volatility of Bitcoin.


The provided alpha and beta analysis shows extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values with highly variable and often negative returns in individual years.  The Beta consistently reads as 0.0 which is probably due to the methodology applied for the calculation (likely excluding market capitalization which is a valid approach).  This high variability makes drawing conclusions about future performance from historical data difficult and indicates a high risk profile.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

Given the Last Market Price of 97117.28, there is no significant indication of a sudden price surge or crash.  The relatively small difference between the closing and last market price also supports this conclusion.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

Bitcoin has historically shown significantly higher returns than the S&P 500, but this comes with substantially increased risk.  The high volatility illustrated by the CAGR and MDD data makes reliable long-term predictions challenging.  Current technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook, with the RSI near 50 and the PPO negative. The significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is historically high but needs to be viewed with consideration of the inherent volatility of the asset.  The expected return of 758.5% needs further clarification on the model used to achieve this number.  The lack of current news makes a complete analysis impossible;  this section needs to be populated with current events before a thorough conclusion can be reached.
