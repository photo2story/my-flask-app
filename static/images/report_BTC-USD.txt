2026-01-01 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) data, along with analysis and considerations.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (vs. S&P 500 - VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
*   **Bitcoin Cumulative Return:** 3998.55%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence Analysis:**
    *   **Divergence:** 3896.3 (Bitcoin's return exceeds the S&P 500's return by this percentage.)
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 64.0 (The divergence is currently in the 64th percentile of its historical range. This suggests it is in the middle part of its historic range.)
*   **Analysis of Alpha, Beta, and Related Metrics:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | 4007.0%  | 79.2% | 3901.0%  | -0.0  | 1747.7 |

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR is extremely high (4007.0%), indicating substantial growth during the period.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD of 79.2% means that at some point during this period, an investor could have experienced a peak-to-trough loss of 79.2% of their investment.  This highlights the high volatility and risk associated with Bitcoin.
    *   **Alpha:** The massive alpha (3901.0%) suggests that Bitcoin has significantly outperformed the benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.  This is a large number that likely contributes to higher Market Risk Indicator (MRI)
    *   **Beta:**  A beta of -0.0 suggests virtually no correlation with the S&P 500.  Bitcoin's price movements are largely independent of the broader market.
    *   **Cap(B):** 1747.7 Billion is the capitalization.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 87495.61
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 87515.49, Previous Close: 88407.73, Change: -1.01%
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 87740.38
    *   20-day SMA: 87835.41
    *   60-day SMA: 92519.80
*   **Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages. This suggests a short-term downward trend. The 5-day SMA being below the 20-day SMA also supports this. The 60-day SMA is significantly higher than the 5-day and 20-day, indicating a more pronounced change in price direction.

**3) Index Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended). A high MRI, despite the volatility, indicates a favorable assessment of Bitcoin's investment potential based on the algorithm's criteria.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 51.96 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.2879 (A positive value suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating potential upward momentum).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (48 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). This is a strong buy signal, allocating all available cash to Bitcoin based on the algorithm's risk assessment.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.2 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase). This suggests a recent positive trend in Bitcoin's outperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Change:** -1.01%. This reflects the recent market price fluctuation issue (recent small sharp decline).
*   **Expected Return (%):** 2642.6%.  This is an extremely high expected return, suggesting that the model anticipates significant future growth for Bitcoin over the long term relative to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Key Themes:** The news headlines indicate volatility, price fluctuations around the $90,000 level, and mentions of broader market influences (e.g., stock market gains). Articles discuss price drops, recovery attempts, and potential macro resets.
*   **Notable Headlines:**
    *   "BTC USD price today falls below $88,000: Why Bitcoin retreats from $90,000..." - Indicates a recent price decline.
    *   "Bitcoin rises above $90,000 as cryptocurrency attempts recovery amid stock market gains" - Shows the price is attempting to recover.
    *   "Bitcoin reverses brief $90K spike as U.S. stocks edge down" - highlights volatility and some correlation with US Stocks.
    *    "Bitcoin Stock: Set For The 2026 Macro Reset" - could indicate a long term prediction.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Not Provided.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Summary:**  Bitcoin shows exceptionally high historical growth (CAGR) and outperformance (Alpha) compared to the S&P 500, but also significant volatility (MDD).  The recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend, with the price below key moving averages. However, the MRI remains high, and the hybrid signal strongly recommends buying. The expected return is exceptionally high, indicating long-term optimism from the model.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **High Volatility:** The large MDD underscores the inherent risk in Bitcoin.  Investors should be prepared for potentially significant price swings.
    *   **Independent Price Action:** The low beta suggests that Bitcoin can act as a diversifier in a broader portfolio. It will likely not follow the same movements as the S&P 500.
    *   **Conflicting Signals:**  While the moving averages point to a short-term downtrend, the MRI and hybrid signal are bullish. This highlights the importance of considering multiple indicators and timeframes.
    *   **News Sentiment:** Recent news points to volatility and price fluctuations around the $90,000 mark. This aligns with the observed price action and suggests that Bitcoin is currently facing some headwinds.
    *   **Analyst Opinion Lacking:** The analysis would be improved with analyst consensus information.

*   **Overall:** Based on the data provided, Bitcoin presents a high-risk, potentially high-reward investment opportunity. The strong growth potential and positive MRI and hybrid signal are compelling, but the volatility and recent price weakness should not be ignored.
