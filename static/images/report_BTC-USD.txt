**Table Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  The CAGR varies significantly across different periods, demonstrating BTC-USD's high volatility. Some periods show explosive growth, while others show negative returns.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD is consistently high, indicating substantial risk.  Investors should be prepared for significant price declines.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are very high, suggesting that BTC-USD's returns are largely independent of market movements (S&P 500).  However, this also means that BTC-USD may not benefit as much from broad market rallies.
*   **Beta:**  The Beta values are low, near zero, confirming that BTC-USD's price movements have had little correlation with the S&P 500 during these periods. This reinforces its role as a potentially diversifying asset, but also a potentially isolating one during market downturns.
*   **Cap(B):** Represent the market capitalization in Billions

*   The price is significantly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a strong uptrend over the medium and longer terms.
*   The recent price decrease (-1.07%) and close below the 5-day MA may signal a short-term consolidation or a potential reversal, but further confirmation is needed.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - This suggests a positive outlook for investment at this time based on the indicator's algorithm.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_1%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 1% on 2025-08-14) - This is a moderately bullish signal, recommending a partial buy with caution. The small cash reserve suggests a conservative approach.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Performance Change:** 9.4% (+) - This indicates a strong recent improvement in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 983.2% - This is a very high projected excess return compared to the S&P 500, but it's based on long-term (2+ years) dollar-cost averaging. The inherent risk in high projections should be noted.

Dollar-cost averaging over the long term could be a suitable strategy for risk-tolerant investors. Keep a close watch on general trends and news surrounding Bitcoin as well as general market trends, given its independent status.
