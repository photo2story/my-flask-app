## BTC-USD Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

BTC-USD, a decentralized digital currency, shows a cumulative return of 8544.33%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%.  The difference in cumulative return is 8415.5. The relative divergence of 97.5% indicates that BTC-USD's performance is situated at the very high end of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This is a significant outperformance, but it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and the volatility of BTC-USD is considerably higher than that of the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD     | Alpha | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|---------|-------|--------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 259.7%    | 36.0%   | 248.2% | 5.8    | 290.0  |
| 2016-2018  | 105.2%    | 82.5%   | 95.4% | 5.8    | 74.1   |
| 2017-2019  | 90.3%     | 82.5%   | 75.4% | 6.3    | 142.3  |
| 2018-2020  | 24.6%     | 80.9%   | 10.8% | 3.1    | 573.9  |
| 2019-2021  | 127.3%    | 61.0%   | 101.3%| 3.3    | 916.3  |
| 2020-2022  | 33.5%     | 76.3%   | 26.1% | 2.8    | 328.5  |
| 2021-2023  | 9.6%      | 76.3%   | -0.9% | 3.7    | 833.1  |
| 2022-2024  | 27.6%     | 66.3%   | 18.3% | 3.2    | 1820.2 |

The high Alpha values historically suggest significant outperformance relative to the benchmark, though this has fluctuated considerably.  The high Beta values indicate significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  Note that the Alpha calculation in the table is questionable as it uses a percentage rather than a standard deviation or Sharpe Ratio.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 96599.99
* **Last Market Price:** 95212.98
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 95495.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 90598.39
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 74500.93

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend in the short to medium term. However, the significant gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages highlights the recent rapid price increase.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 60.15 (Neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment.)
* **PPO:** -0.74 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum, but it is close to zero, meaning it might be a weak bearish signal.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +21.0 (Indicates a short-term upward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** 4262.1% (This is a projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment. This projection should be treated with extreme caution, as cryptocurrency markets are extraordinarily volatile and unpredictable.)

The last market price (95212.98) being slightly lower than the closing price doesn't indicate a significant immediate price change (no sharp drop or rebound).

**7.  Summary of Analysis:**

BTC-USD has historically exhibited exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with extremely high volatility.  Recent price action shows upward momentum, supported by moving averages and a slightly bullish RSI. However, the negative PPO suggests some underlying bearish pressure. The lack of traditional financial data makes fundamental analysis impossible. Any investment decision requires carefully considering the extreme risk associated with cryptocurrency investments. The extremely high expected return should be viewed as highly speculative.
