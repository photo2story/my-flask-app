**1. Performance Analysis & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is a decentralized digital currency, operating independently of a central bank.  The cumulative return for BTC-USD is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 6351.75% for BTC-USD compared to 115.41% for VOO.  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last day in the dataset is 6236.34%.  The relative divergence of 88.1% indicates that BTC-USD's performance significantly outpaces VOO historically, although this is a relative measure based on past data range.  The high volatility, as evidenced by the CAGR and MDD figures in the provided table, highlights the substantial risk associated with BTC-USD investment.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently high alpha values (significantly outperforming the market) and extremely high beta values (high volatility and market sensitivity), especially in certain periods.  The beta values are exceptionally high, indicating extreme sensitivity to market movements. This high beta reflects the inherent risk associated with Bitcoin.  The negative CAGR in 2021-2023 shows a significant downturn.
