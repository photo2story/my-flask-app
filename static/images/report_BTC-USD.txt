Bitcoin has historically shown substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with extremely high volatility.

The negative PPO signal adds a degree of caution.  Recent news and market sentiment will heavily influence future performance.  Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to thoroughly research current market conditions and consult with a financial advisor.  The high expected return must be critically assessed against the substantial risk profile of Bitcoin.
