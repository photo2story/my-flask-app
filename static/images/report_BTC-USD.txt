2026-01-01 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Bitcoin (BTC-USD) based on the provided data.

**1) Return Rate and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** BTC-USD
*   **Company Name:** Bitcoin
*   **Overview:** Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
*   **Bitcoin Cumulative Return:** 1797.9154714664433
*   **S&P 500 Cumulative Return:** 0.0
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 1797.9
    *   Relative Divergence: 64.1%

**Analysis:** Bitcoin has massively outperformed the S&P 500 during the period in question. The cumulative return difference is substantial. However, the relative divergence of 64.1% suggests that while Bitcoin is performing well, it is not at the extreme high end of its historical divergence range, leaving room for potential further upside or a correction. The sheer magnitude of the outperformance suggests higher risk compared to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
| :----------- | :------ | :------ | :------ | :---- | :----- |
| 2016-2018  | 248.0%  | 76.9% | 248.0%  | 0.3   | 74.7  |
| 2017-2019  | 258.0%  | 76.9% | 258.0%  | 0.3   | 143.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 277.0%  | 76.9% | 277.0%  | 0.7   | 579.2 |
| 2019-2021  | 1570.0% | 75.8% | 1570.0% | 0.9   | 924.7 |
| 2020-2022  | 250.0%  | 75.8% | 250.0%  | 1.1   | 330.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -205.0% | 75.8% | -205.0% | 1.3   | 844.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 972.0%  | 74.5% | 972.0%  | 1.3   | 1865.8 |
| 2023-2025  | 798.0%  | 71.7% | 798.0%  | 0.9   | 1747.3 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR varies significantly, showing periods of explosive growth (e.g., 2019-2021) and one significant decline (2021-2023).  This highlights Bitcoin's volatile nature.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD is consistently high, ranging from 71.7% to 76.9%. This indicates substantial risk of loss during these periods.  Investors need to be prepared for large price swings.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are very high (both positive and negative) mirroring the CAGR, reflecting significant outperformance (or underperformance) relative to a benchmark. This likely means bitcoin price action is fairly idiosyncratic as it is difficult to find a benchmark that tracks it closely.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values fluctuate, but generally range from 0.3 to 1.3. This indicates that Bitcoin's volatility is correlated with the market, and has periods of being less and more volatile than the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 87873.5625
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 87889.7, 'previousClose': 87512.875, 'change': 0.43}
*   **5-day SMA:** 87754.6562
*   **20-day SMA:** 87715.566
*   **60-day SMA:** 92149.96

**Analysis:** The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, the price is below the 60-day SMA, which could indicate a potential resistance level or a longer-term bearish trend. The slight positive "change" in the last market price indicates a mild upward tick.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 65.52238234741523
*   **PPO:** 0.2985
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_1%_Buy 100% of cash (20 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 1% on 2025-10-26)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 3612.4%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** An MRI of 0.9 suggests that, based on this model, the market is currently considered a good time for investment. However, relying solely on this indicator is not recommended.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 65.52 suggests that Bitcoin is approaching overbought conditions. While not yet in overbought territory (typically above 70), it's getting closer.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 0.2985 suggests that short-term momentum is slightly positive relative to long-term momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests a strong buy signal, allocating a large portion of available cash to Bitcoin.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decrease in relative divergence suggests a short-term weakening in Bitcoin's outperformance compared to its historical trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extraordinarily high expected return of 3612.4% is a strong bullish signal, indicating potentially very high returns if held long-term (more than 2 years), but also likely reflects the high risk and volatility associated with Bitcoin.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Volatility:** "Bitcoin reverses brief $90K spike" highlights the potential for sudden and significant price swings.
*   **Market Trends:** "Bitcoin Is Set for First Yearly Split From Stocks in Decade" indicates a decoupling from traditional market correlations, making it a potentially unique asset class.
*   **Price Predictions:** "Charles Hoskinson says Bitcoin could reach $250,0" reflects optimistic long-term forecasts from industry figures.
*   **Technical Analysis:** "BTC/USD Hammer Candle Meets Nvidia Earnings" indicates potential bullish technical patterns alongside broader market events.
*   **Macroeconomic Outlook:** "Bitcoin Stock: Set For The 2026 Macro Reset" suggests Bitcoin's potential role in a changing economic landscape.
*   **Recovery Attempts:** "Bitcoin rises above $90,000 as cryptocurrency attempts recovery amid stock market gains" shows that Bitcoin's price still moves according to market expectations, and that Bitcoin price still moves cyclically.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Overall Sentiment:** The data presents a mixed picture. Bitcoin shows short-term upward momentum, but longer-term trends are less clear. The MRI indicates a favorable time for investment according to its specific algorithm. However, the high MDD and news of price volatility highlight substantial risk.
*   **Investment Recommendation:** The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy recommendation (100% cash allocation), but investors should consider the high risk, high volatility, and potential for significant drawdowns. The RSI nearing overbought territory suggests caution, and the recent decline in relative divergence indicates a potential short-term pullback.
*   **Risk Management:** Due to the extreme volatility and risk associated with Bitcoin, proper risk management is essential. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance, investment horizon, and diversify their portfolios accordingly. Start with the hybrid signal recommendation of putting only 1% of cash into BTC.
*   **News Impact:** Recent news indicates both significant volatility and potential for long-term growth. The decoupling from traditional markets, if sustained, could make Bitcoin a valuable diversifier, but also introduces uncertainty.

**In summary:** Bitcoin presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. The technical indicators and news suggest potential for continued growth, but also highlight the possibility of significant losses. Before investing, individuals should conduct thorough research, carefully assess their risk tolerance, and consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor.
