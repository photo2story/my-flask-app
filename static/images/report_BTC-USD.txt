|     2020-2022 |    616 |  79.2 |     617 |    0.2 |    331.1 |
|     2021-2023 |   -280 |  79.2 |    -282 |    0.3 |    845.8 |
|     2022-2024 |   2208 |  76   |    2187 |    0.3 |   1869.6 |
|     2023-2025 |   1647 |  73.4 |    1584 |    0.2 |   1702.6 |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is exceptionally high for most periods, demonstrating Bitcoin's potential for rapid growth.  The 2021-2023 period is a notable exception with negative CAGR.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.  Investors should be prepared for substantial potential losses.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are also very high, reflecting Bitcoin's ability to generate returns above and beyond what would be expected based on market movements (S&P 500). Negative Alpha in 2021-2023.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are very low, close to zero.  This is unexpected, as Bitcoin is generally considered more volatile than the market. A Beta near zero suggests Bitcoin's movements are largely uncorrelated with the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** This is the market capitalization in Billions.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 85085.22
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 85283.93
    *   Previous Close: 86196.79
    *   Change: -1.06% (a slight decrease)
*   **Simple Moving Averages (SMA):**
    *   5-day SMA: 86920.97
    *   20-day SMA: 89893.74
    *   60-day SMA: 97499.11

*   **Analysis:** Bitcoin's current price is below all three SMAs (5, 20, and 60-day), suggesting a short-term downward trend. The fact that the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, reinforces this bearish signal.

**3. Index Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment) -  Suggests a moderate level of risk, recommending caution in investment allocation.
*   **RSI:** 30.93 -  The Relative Strength Index is below 30, indicating that Bitcoin may be oversold and could experience a potential price rebound.
*   **PPO:** -0.1987 - The Percentage Price Oscillator is negative, further indicating a downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (48 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) - This is a model-driven suggestion, recommending full investment based on its specific criteria.  It highlights a discrepancy between the general MRI and this model's risk assessment.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.0 (-): Short-term decline is expected based on divergence change.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 2762.3% - A very high expected return, suggesting significant potential upside if held long-term (more than 2 years) relative to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Bearish Signals:**
    *   "Bitcoin price slides as crash fears grow despite Fed interest rate cuts" - Negative sentiment and potential market instability.

    *   "Strategy Announces Establishment of $1.44 Billion USD Reserve and Updates FY 2025 Guidance" - Positive company-specific news (if relevant to investment).

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Based on the provided data:

*   **Short-Term Bearish, Long-Term Bullish?** The technical indicators (SMA, RSI, PPO) suggest a short-term downward trend, potentially oversold. However, the long-term expected return remains very high, and some analysts predict new all-time highs.
*   **High Risk, High Reward:** Bitcoin continues to exhibit high volatility (as indicated by the MDD), and the wide divergence from the S&P 500 underscores the asset's distinct risk profile.  The high Alpha values show historical outperformance.
*   **News Impact:** Recent news presents a mixed picture. Crash fears and price reversals are concerning, while optimistic forecasts and company-specific news provide some support.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** The MRI suggests "Medium Investment", while the Hybrid Signal is very bullish ("Buy 100%"). This highlights the challenges in assessing Bitcoin, with different models and indicators producing contrasting recommendations.
*   **In Summary:** Bitcoin appears to be experiencing a short-term pullback, but its long-term potential remains significant. Investors should carefully weigh their risk tolerance and consider both bullish and bearish news signals before making any decisions. A cautious approach is advised, acknowledging the high volatility and potential for significant price swings.
