## BTC-USD Stock Report

This report analyzes BTC-USD, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin,  traded in USD.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

BTC-USD has shown a cumulative return of 6727.696%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 76.2677%. The difference is 6651.4%, placing it at the 74th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500 (based on a range of -11.9% to 8998.1%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and significant outperformance relative to the market (high Beta values) in several periods, especially noticeable in 2019-2021. However, the negative CAGR in 2021-2023 highlights significant periods of underperformance. The recent period (2022-2025) shows substantial positive CAGR and demonstrates Bitcoin's potential for high returns, even with substantial drawdown (MDD) risk.  Note that the Alpha values, while positive, should be interpreted cautiously given the non-traditional nature of BTC-USD compared to traditional equities. The large market capitalization (Cap(B)) also indicates significant market depth and liquidity.



**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $93441.89
* **Last Market Price:** $93163.0 (a decrease of 0.58% from the previous close of $93703.26)  This indicates a slight recent price downturn.
* **5-day Moving Average:** $87129.86
* **20-day Moving Average:** $83577.03
* **60-day Moving Average:** $85049.68

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend, although the recent slight decline may be a correction.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)  indicates moderate risk.
* **RSI:** 79.70 (Overbought). This high RSI suggests the asset may be overbought and susceptible to a price correction.
* **PPO:** 1.23  A positive PPO indicates a bullish momentum, although a high value like this combined with an overbought RSI suggests a potential price correction is imminent.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.2 This shows a short-term upward trend in relative performance.


The recent price change of -0.58% indicates a minor downward correction, not a significant crash.

* **Expected Return:** 1979.4%  This represents a projected significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), assuming consistent,  periodic investment.  This extremely high expectation should be treated with caution; the projected return depends heavily on the assumption of continued strong, long-term growth in Bitcoin which is not guaranteed.  High volatility inherent to Bitcoin is a major risk factor.


**Conclusion:**

BTC-USD has demonstrated remarkable returns compared to the S&P 500 over several periods. However, itâ€™s characterized by extreme volatility.  While current indicators suggest potential for further short-term gains, the overbought RSI and recent price dip warrant caution.  The extremely high projected long-term return should be considered alongside the significant risk associated with such a volatile asset.  A diversified investment strategy is recommended to mitigate potential losses.
