## BTC-USD Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

BTC-USD, representing Bitcoin, is a decentralized digital currency.  The provided data shows significant price volatility and substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO) historically, although recent performance has been negative.  Key indicators suggest the asset is currently oversold, presenting a potentially attractive entry point for long-term investors, despite near-term uncertainty.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The cumulative return for BTC-USD is 5733.85%, dramatically exceeding the S&P 500's cumulative return of 108.62%. The divergence is substantial (currently 5625.2, representing the 79.5th percentile of historical divergence).  However, this high return is accompanied by significant risk, reflected in the high maximum drawdown (MDD) values across the provided periods.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high Alpha values (especially in recent periods) indicating consistent outperformance relative to the market benchmark, but also a highly volatile Beta, showing substantial market sensitivity.  The substantial variation in CAGR highlights the extreme volatility of Bitcoin's performance. The negative CAGR from 2021-2023 reflects a significant market downturn. Note that Beta values are exceptionally high, indicating extreme price fluctuations influenced by overall market movement.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 86742.67
* **Last Market Price:** 86063.20 (a decrease of -0.14% from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 88123.17
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 91295.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 96679.52

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (38.23):**  Indicates the asset is approaching oversold territory.
* **PPO (0.02):**  A positive value suggests potential upward momentum, though close to neutral.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (1.7, +):**  Shows a recent short-term upward trend in relative strength.

The relatively small negative change in the last market price (-0.14%) does not suggest a significant immediate price shift (no 급반등 or 급하락).

The expected return of 1038.8% represents a substantial potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance against the S&P 500, but this projection should be treated with caution given the inherent volatility of Bitcoin.  This high expected return reflects the historical outperformance but doesn't guarantee future results.  The high risk associated with this asset should be carefully considered.
