## BTC-USD Investment Report

**Executive Summary:** This report analyzes the performance of Bitcoin (BTC-USD), comparing its cumulative return and volatility to the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  BTC-USD is a cryptocurrency, a decentralized digital currency using cryptography for security.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Bitcoin's cumulative return of 6445.18% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's 120.63% return. The difference is 6324.5%, placing it at the 89.3rd percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 (max: 7085.6%, min: -33.3%). This indicates BTC-USD has historically shown periods of significantly higher returns than the S&P 500.  However, the substantial volatility is evident in the provided data.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures for BTC-USD, particularly before 2021. However, there's significant volatility indicated by high Maximum Drawdown (MDD). The alpha values are initially near zero but increase in later periods to 0.5, implying positive performance against a benchmark (although the choice of benchmark isn't specified). The consistently high beta values suggest significant market sensitivity, reflecting the risk associated with Bitcoin. Note the negative CAGR and significant MDD in 2021-2023.


| Year       | CAGR       | MDD     | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|------------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 2983.0%    | 11.6%   | -0.0  | 294.3 |        |
| 2016-2018  | 470.0%     | 36.4%   | -0.0  | 75.1  |        |
| 2017-2019  | 693.0%     | 36.4%   | -0.0  | 144.4 |        |
| 2018-2020  | 1186.0%    | 36.4%   | 0.1   | 582.3 |        |
| 2019-2021  | 3940.0%    | 38.2%   | 0.1   | 929.7 |        |
| 2020-2022  | 189.0%     | 38.2%   | 0.1   | 333.3 |        |
| 2021-2023  | -598.0%    | 38.2%   | 0.5   | 845.2 |        |
| 2022-2024  | 2736.0%    | 37.8%   | 0.5   | 1875.8|        |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 96593.296875
* **Last Market Price:** 97841.8203125 (a slight increase from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 98034.9922
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 101929.2527
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 99170.6855

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The relatively small difference between the last market price and previous close suggests a lack of significant price movement recently.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 34.21 - Suggests the asset is in oversold territory (below 30 is generally considered oversold), potentially indicating a buying opportunity for some investors.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.96 - A negative value suggests bearish momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -8.5% - Indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative strength against the market.

* **Expected Return:** 790.5% -  This represents a significantly high expected return over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon compared to the S&P 500. However, this is just an *estimate* and doesn't account for the high volatility inherent in Bitcoin.  The extremely high expected return should be considered in the context of the substantial risk involved.

**Conclusion:**

BTC-USD has historically shown exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with significantly higher risk and volatility. The current indicators suggest a potentially oversold market (RSI), but the negative PPO and recent relative divergence hint at continued short-term weakness.  The projected high long-term return should be carefully weighed against the inherent risk of investing in Bitcoin.  A diversified investment strategy is recommended for risk mitigation.  Further analysis including broader market context and risk tolerance is advisable before any investment decisions.
