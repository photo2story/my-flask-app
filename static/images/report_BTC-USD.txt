**Company Overview:**

BTC-USD represents Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency.


**Performance Analysis:**

The provided data shows a stark contrast between the cumulative returns of BTC-USD and the S&P 500 (VOO) index.  BTC-USD has significantly outperformed VOO over the measured period, with a cumulative return of 6399.28% compared to VOO's 71.02%. The substantial difference highlights Bitcoin's high volatility and potential for substantial gains (and losses), in contrast to the relatively more stable S&P 500.

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for BTC-USD varies significantly year over year, reflecting its inherent volatility.  While several years show extremely high CAGR, the 2021-2023 period shows a negative CAGR, indicating periods of significant decline.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values also reflect this substantial risk.  The Alpha values suggest periods of outperformance against a benchmark (though the benchmark isn't specified), while the Beta values show high sensitivity to market fluctuations, particularly in later years. The high beta values, particularly in the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods, suggest high market sensitivity.


**Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 83965.83
* **Last Market Price:** 82262.32
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 83454.49
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 84496.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 89007.81

The recent price of 82262.32 is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  It is also significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a more substantial pullback. The price has dropped from the previous close (83502.17), with a change of -1.48%, a relatively modest daily decrease.


**Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4782 (High Risk) – This suggests a higher level of market risk associated with BTC-USD.
* **RSI:** 49.77 – Near the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.0855 – A positive value indicates bullish momentum, though it is relatively small.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.7 – Suggests a recent short-term downward trend in relative divergence.
* **Expected Return:** 2318.8% –  This extremely high expected return over the long term (2+ years) reflects the potential for significant growth, but also the associated high risk.  It's crucial to remember that this is a projection and doesn't guarantee future performance.


**Conclusion:**

BTC-USD has demonstrated significantly higher returns than the S&P 500, but with substantially higher risk.  The high volatility and significant drawdowns highlight the need for a careful risk management strategy. While the high expected return is enticing for long-term investors, the substantial volatility and high risk should be carefully considered.  The recent price movement suggests a short-term downward trend, but the long-term outlook, based on the provided data, remains positive relative to VOO, although still very volatile.
