*   **Risk Management:**  Be aware of the high MDD and only invest capital you can afford to lose.
*   **Due Diligence:**  Thoroughly research the cryptocurrency market and BTC-USD-specific risks before investing.  Pay close attention to relevant news and developments in the cryptocurrency space, *not* unrelated stock market headlines.
