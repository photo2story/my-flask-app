| 2023-2025  | 1647.0% | 73.4% | 1584.0% | 0.2  | 1701.5 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Extremely high growth rates in most periods, but negative in 2021-2023.  This highlights Bitcoin's volatile nature.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high drawdowns indicate significant price drops are a common occurrence.  Investors should be prepared for substantial losses.
*   **Alpha:**  The positive alpha across most periods suggests Bitcoin has generated returns *above* what would be expected based on its beta (correlation with the market).  The outperformance is substantial.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values are very low, close to zero.  This suggests Bitcoin's price movements have historically been largely *independent* of the overall stock market (S&P 500).  While some recent periods show a slightly higher beta, it remains relatively low.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Cap):** General increasing trend in market cap shows growing adoption and investment in Bitcoin.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 85085.22
*   **Last-Market:**
    *   Price: 85186.52
    *   Previous Close: 86196.79
    *   Change: -1.17%
*   **5-day SMA:** 86920.97
*   **20-day SMA:** 89893.74
*   **60-day SMA:** 97499.11

**Analysis:**

*   The price closed slightly lower than the previous close, indicating a small recent decline.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This *could* be interpreted as a short-term downtrend forming. The price is below all SMAs indicating a potentially bearish sentiment in the short to medium term.

**3) Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 30.93
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.1987
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (48 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-26)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Price Fluctuation:** The recent change of -1.17% suggests there is some short-term fluctuation (decline).
*   **Expected Return (%):** 2762.3% (Long-term, >2 years)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests a moderate level of risk is perceived.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 30.93 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), which *might* suggest a potential buying opportunity, though further confirmation is needed.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO indicates the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, also suggesting a possible downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Despite the current downtrend, the Hybrid Signal recommends allocating 100% of cash to Bitcoin, based on a high MRI of 0.90, indicating a "Very Safe" assessment on 2025-10-26. It suggests a buy signal.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence aligns with the short-term downtrend signals from the SMAs and PPO.
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return over a long-term horizon reflects the potential for significant gains, but also the inherent risk and volatility associated with Bitcoin.
