**Comprehensive Analysis:**
Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset with a significantly high cumulative return rate compared to the S&P 500. The stock price fluctuations indicate a potential rebound, supported by the recent news of Michael Saylor's strategy buying $1.25 billion worth of Bitcoin. However, the worsening relative divergence and flat 7-day rank suggest caution. With a high market risk indicator of 0.80, investors are recommended to adopt a high-investment strategy. The expected return of 1032.60% for a long-term investment (> 2 years) is substantial, but the recent price movements and news events should be closely monitored.
