The provided data shows a cumulative return of 8425.72% for BTC-USD compared to 129.75% for the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last date in the data is approximately **8296.0 percentage points**.  While the relative divergence metric indicates BTC-USD's performance is significantly higher than the S&P 500 based on historical data (96.1 percentile), the extreme volatility is evident in the provided CAGR data, which shows both massive gains and significant losses over different time periods.  The high alpha values historically demonstrate significant outperformance relative to a benchmark, but the beta is effectively zero, suggesting a low correlation with traditional markets.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 96002.16
* **Last Market Price:** 97218.24 (A slight increase from the closing price)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 96611.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 94450.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 77914.45

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it's still below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term trend that may require further analysis.  The recent increase to 97218.24 suggests a minor recent uptrend, but does not qualify as a "sharp rebound."


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 57.74 – This suggests the market is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.07 –  A negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.  This conflicts somewhat with the slight recent price increase.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (-) – This indicates a short-term downward trend in relative divergence (the data may be incomplete), highlighting the volatility and need for caution.
* **Expected Return:** 4367.6% – This represents a significant potential return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, but should be viewed with skepticism due to Bitcoin’s volatility.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Bitcoin has historically demonstrated exceptionally high returns compared to traditional markets like the S&P 500, but this comes with significantly higher volatility and risk.  While the recent price action suggests a potential short-term uptrend, the negative PPO and the past periods of substantial negative returns highlight the inherent risks. The high expected return over the long term needs to be carefully considered in light of its inherent volatility. The current RSI and moving averages suggest a neutral to mildly bullish short-term outlook, but investors should be wary of the potential for significant price swings.  Thorough due diligence, risk tolerance assessment, and careful monitoring of market developments and regulatory changes are crucial before investing in Bitcoin.  The lack of data on recent relative divergence is concerning and makes the analysis incomplete.
