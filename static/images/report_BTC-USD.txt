## BTC-USD Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

BTC-USD, or Bitcoin, is a decentralized digital currency.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500, although volatility is substantial.  Recent price action shows the price is below its recent highs, but above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages. Indicators suggest a moderately bullish but potentially risky position.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **BTC-USD Cumulative Return:** 6301.24%

* **Return Difference:** 6228.82%  (BTC-USD significantly outperforms VOO)
* **Relative Divergence:** 69.3% (This indicates BTC-USD's performance relative to VOO is in the upper 69th percentile of its historical range.  It does *not* mean it's 69% better than VOO, only that its current outperformance is higher than in 69% of past periods).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The table shows highly variable CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), MDD (Maximum Drawdown), Alpha, and Beta across different periods.  High alpha values in recent years suggest outperformance relative to the market, while the extremely high beta reflects Bitcoin's volatility.  Note the substantial negative CAGR in 2021-2023, highlighting the significant risk associated with this asset.  The large Beta values indicate high market sensitivity.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 2267.0% (Significant expected excess return compared to the S&P 500, but this should be viewed with caution given the inherent volatility of Bitcoin).

**Conclusion:**

BTC-USD has historically demonstrated exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with extremely high volatility and risk.  While current indicators show a moderately bullish short-term outlook and significant long-term potential return, investors should be aware of the potential for substantial losses. The recent slight price drop should be monitored closely.  The high risk profile necessitates a carefully considered investment strategy with a significant risk tolerance. The high expected return is predicated on Bitcoin maintaining and continuing its historical volatility and trend, which is not guaranteed.
