**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** BTC-USD
*   **Company:** BTC-USD (Cryptocurrency) - A decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
*   **BTC-USD Cumulative Return:** 7370.39%

**Analysis:** BTC-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis (Periodical):**

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta  | Cap(B) |
| ---------- | --------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | ------ |
| 2015-2017  | 3058.0%   | 63.1% | 3029.0%  | -0.0  | 286.1  |

| 2019-2021  | 6092.0%   | 73.5% | 6043.0%  | 0.1   | 936.0  |
| 2020-2022  | 1409.0%   | 73.5% | 1407.0%  | 0.1   | 334.5  |
| 2021-2023  | -172.0%   | 73.5% | -190.0%  | 0.3   | 854.3  |
| 2022-2024  | 2194.0%   | 70.9% | 2168.0%  | 0.3   | 1888.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 3624.0%   | 65.8% | 3570.0%  | 0.2   | 2247.1 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate is extremely high for most periods, showcasing impressive historical growth. However, the 2021-2023 period shows a negative return.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown indicates substantial risk, consistently high across all periods. This highlights the volatile nature of BTC-USD.
*   **Alpha:** The extremely high Alpha values indicate significant outperformance relative to a risk-free benchmark.  Even after accounting for market risk (captured by Beta), BTC-USD has generated substantial excess returns.
*   **Beta:** Beta is very low. This suggests BTC-USD's price movements have had a very weak relationship with the overall market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization trend is increasing

**2. Recent Price Movements**

*   **Current Price:** 111167.62
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 112818.66
    *   Previous Close: 111142.38
    *   Change: 1.51% (Positive)
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day: 111197.17
    *   20-day: 112123.36
    *   60-day: 115508.68

**Analysis:**  The recent price increase of 1.51% is a positive sign. The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which *could* suggest a short-term upward trend, but the price is still below the longer-term averages. More time may be needed to see if the upward trend continues.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 40.13 (Neutral - Neither Overbought nor Oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.0595
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_14%_Buy 80% of cash (48 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33) (Cash Ratio: 14% on 2025-09-07)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.2 (+) (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 2103.4% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The "Low Risk" indication from the MRI is somewhat contradictory to the high MDD and volatile history. It's crucial to understand the model behind the MRI.
*   **RSI:** The RSI suggests a neutral condition, with neither strong buying nor selling pressure.
*   **PPO:**  PPO is positive suggesting bullish momentum
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The recommendation is to buy 80% of cash available, but with caution. This suggests a moderately bullish outlook but with risk awareness.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** A positive change in relative divergence indicates that BTC-USD is outperforming VOO in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:**  The extraordinarily high expected return should be viewed with skepticism.  It's unlikely that such a high return can be consistently achieved.

*   **FDA clears Microbotâ€™s LIBERTY endovascular robot:** This news is unrelated to BTC-USD and should be disregarded.
*   **Trump tariffs exempt products that can't be made in America:** This news could have indirect macroeconomic implications affecting investment sentiment, but is not directly relevant to BTC-USD.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   No analyst consensus or target information was provided.

**5. Overall Summary**

BTC-USD has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but with a high degree of volatility and risk (high MDD). Recent price action shows a slight upward trend, and technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish outlook. However, the MRI indicating "Low Risk" should be interpreted with caution, considering historical volatility.

**Recommendation:**

The provided "Hybrid Signal" suggests a cautious buy. Given the high expected return, a small allocation *might* be considered for investors with a very high risk tolerance.  However, it is crucial to conduct thorough independent research, carefully evaluate your risk tolerance, and be prepared for significant price swings.  The expected return should be viewed skeptically. The impact of potential regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifts in market sentiment should all be considered.
