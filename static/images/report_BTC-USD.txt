**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

The difference in cumulative returns is approximately 6961.6%, placing it at the 98.3rd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 105186.85
* **Last Market Price:** 105054.52
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 102998.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 101531.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 99096.11

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price is minimal (0.28%), indicating a relatively stable period immediately preceding the data snapshot.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 61.25 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.0006 (Near zero, suggesting little momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 1.2 (+) (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 626.4% (This is a high projected return; it's crucial to note that such high returns are associated with high risk and are not guaranteed).  This represents a projected significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  The high volatility of Bitcoin however, makes this projection very uncertain.


**Important Considerations:**

The high expected return for Bitcoin comes with significantly higher risk compared to the S&P 500. Bitcoin's price is highly volatile, and past performance is not indicative of future results.  The provided analysis should be viewed alongside a thorough understanding of the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. The provided 20-day relative divergence increase suggests a short-term price increase, but does not guarantee the continuation of this trend, especially given the high volatility. The given expected return is highly dependent on the model used and the assumptions involved, and should be viewed with significant caution.
