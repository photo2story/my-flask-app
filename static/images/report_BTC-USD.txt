| 2023-2025  | 2158.0%  | 73.4% | 2095.0%  | 0.2   | 1901.2 |

**Analysis:** The table highlights Bitcoin's high volatility and performance over different periods.

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Varies widely, showing periods of massive growth (e.g., 2015-2017) and contraction (2021-2023).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently positive (except 2021-2023), demonstrating Bitcoin's ability to generate excess returns compared to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Low, suggesting Bitcoin's price is not highly correlated with the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization (in Billions)

**2. Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 95325.2
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 95306.34, Previous Close: 94509.16, Change: 0.84
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 101135.99
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 106101.23
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 111503.13

**Analysis:**  Bitcoin's current price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day). This suggests a short-term downtrend. The positive 'change' from the previous close indicates a slight rebound, but it's too early to determine if this signals a trend reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 27.92 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.70
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (48 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** -5.7 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 1794.3%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:**  The low RSI value indicates that Bitcoin may be oversold and could be due for a potential bounce.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO value indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, signaling a downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The 'Buy 100%' signal contradicts the current downward price action (RSI, PPO, moving averages), indicating the model favors buy despite the current risks, but 'Very Safe' suggests it is based on MRI of 0.9, which is not current MRI.
*   **Relative Spread Change:** Confirms the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return suggests that, over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years), Bitcoin is projected to significantly outperform the S&P 500.

The positive 'change' in the last market data suggests a small upward price movement, which may be related to short-term volatility and potential for a short-term rebound, but should be combined with other indicators to decide.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

The provided news headlines are largely irrelevant to Bitcoin itself, being about PMET Resources, Northlands Rescue Mission, UP CEO's comments on BNSF, ELK-Desa Resources Berhad, Puerto Rico Lottery, and Nike's Air Jordan sale.

**Analysis:** The lack of relevant news suggests no immediate fundamental catalysts driving Bitcoin's price action.

**5. Overall Assessment:**

Bitcoin's historical performance has been exceptional compared to the S&P 500, but it comes with significant volatility. The current technical indicators suggest a short-term downtrend, with the price below key moving averages and an oversold RSI. While the long-term expected return is very high, investors should be aware of the high Maximum Drawdown and the potential for significant price swings.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is recommended. While the long-term outlook remains positive according to the model, the short-term technicals and high volatility warrant careful consideration. Investors might consider a small allocation, focusing on a long-term investment horizon and being prepared to weather potential price corrections.
