## Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

The cumulative return of BTC-USD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The final cumulative return difference between BTC-USD and VOO is 6744.7%. This represents an extremely high divergence, with BTC-USD vastly outperforming the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  The relative divergence of 100% indicates BTC-USD's performance is at the highest point within the historical range compared to VOO. However, it's crucial to remember that this high divergence also reflects the inherent volatility of Bitcoin.


The provided CAGR data shows highly volatile returns, ranging from substantial gains to significant losses.  While showing periods of exceptionally high growth (e.g., 3940% CAGR in 2019-2021), there are also periods of substantial negative returns (e.g., -598% CAGR in 2021-2023). The consistently high Alpha values (though reported as 0.0, which needs clarification) and fluctuating Beta highlight the asset's low correlation with the broader market.  The massive shifts in market capitalization reflect the speculative nature of this asset class.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $101,169.22 (Last Market: $104,697.98)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $99,298.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $97,535.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $84,052.21

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. However, the recent drop from the last market price to the closing price indicates some potential downward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 57.63 – Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, indicating a relatively neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.56 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.  This contradicts the slightly bullish signal from the moving averages, indicating a mixed signal.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.0 (-) –  Indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative divergence.
* **Expected Return:** 3323.3% - This represents a significant expected outperformance against the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon. However, the volatility of Bitcoin should be considered.  The last market price ($104,697.98) being higher than the closing price suggests a recent price correction which could be linked to broader market sentiment or specific news events.

**5. Summary:**

Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, this outperformance comes with extreme volatility.  While the recent price action suggests potential short-term bearish pressure, long-term projections indicate significant potential returns.  Technical indicators offer mixed signals.  The high projected return should be viewed with caution due to the inherent risk associated with Bitcoin's volatility.  Up-to-date news on regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market sentiment is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of the current investment landscape.
