## BTC-USD Investment Review

**0. Overview:**

This report analyzes the performance of BTC-USD (Bitcoin), a decentralized digital currency, against the S&P 500 (VOO) benchmark.  Key metrics including cumulative returns, moving averages, RSI, PPO, and market risk are examined to assess its current market position and potential future performance.


**1. Cumulative Return & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

BTC-USD exhibits a significantly higher cumulative return (7360.91%) than the S&P 500 (87.74%) as of the last data point.  The substantial difference (7273.2 points) positions BTC-USD at the 80.9th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This highlights the considerable outperformance of Bitcoin, though it's important to note this is relative to a specific period and highly volatile.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals substantial positive alpha across most periods, indicating superior performance relative to the market benchmark (though Beta is exceptionally high, reflecting high volatility). However, the recent negative CAGR (-254%) shows extreme volatility and the risk associated with this asset class.  The high Beta values across all periods underscores Bitcoin's high sensitivity to market fluctuations.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD  | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|------|-------|-------|-------|

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 102970.85
* **Last Market Price:** 104614.9 (a decrease of 0.18% from the previous close of 104799.98)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 98959.03
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 94938.82
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 87383.47

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, the slight decrease in the last market price indicates potential short-term consolidation or minor pullback.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk) – indicating moderate risk.
* **RSI:** 73.63 (Approaching overbought territory) – suggesting potential for a short-term correction.
* **PPO:** 0.53 – positive value indicating bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** +4.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 1642.4% – this exceptionally high figure suggests a potential for significant outperformance over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500, but it is essential to acknowledge the associated high risk.  The high volatility of BTC-USD makes this prediction highly uncertain.

**Conclusion:**

BTC-USD has historically shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but its volatility is extremely high. While current indicators show positive momentum, the RSI approaching overbought levels and the recent slight price drop warrant caution.  The projected long-term return is extremely high, but this must be viewed within the context of substantial risk and potential for significant drawdowns.  Any investment decision should consider the investor's risk tolerance and long-term investment horizon.  The high expected return does not guarantee profit and is based on historical data which is not indicative of future performance.
