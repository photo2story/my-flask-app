## BTC-USD Stock Report

**0) Numerical Overview & Initial Analysis:**

BTC-USD, or Bitcoin, is a decentralized digital currency.  The provided data shows significant historical volatility and outperformance against the S&P 500 (VOO), although recent performance has been negative.  Key figures reveal substantial divergence between BTC-USD and VOO returns, and current indicators suggest a potentially oversold market for Bitcoin.

**1) Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **BTC-USD Cumulative Return:** 5688.34%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 55.35%
* **Return Difference:** 5633.0% (This shows the significant outperformance of BTC-USD compared to VOO).
* **Relative Divergence:** 62.6% (This indicates BTC-USD is currently at the 62.6th percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500, based on its min and max divergence values)
* **Alpha & Beta Analysis:**  The provided Alpha and Beta values indicate significant market outperformance (high Alpha) and high volatility (high Beta), especially in certain periods. Note the dramatic shift from massive positive returns in 2015-2021 to negative returns in 2021-2023.   The high beta demonstrates BTC-USD's strong correlation with overall market movements, albeit significantly amplified. The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures highlight the highly fluctuating nature of Bitcoin's returns.

**2) Recent Price Movement (Moving Averages):**

* **Closing Price:** 77191.23
* **Last Market Price:** 77225.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 81171.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 83967.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 88136.27

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downward trend. The recent price decline from 79140.75 to 77225.87  (-2.42%) suggests a continuation of the bearish momentum, although not a significant drop on a single day.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)  This suggests a high degree of market uncertainty.
* **RSI:** 23.22 (Oversold) An RSI below 30 generally suggests an oversold condition, implying a potential bounce-back.
* **PPO:** -0.5937 (Bearish) A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -4.7% (Short-term Downward Trend)
* **Expected Return:** 2771.0%  This represents a substantial potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, this is based on historical data which may not predict future performance, especially given Bitcoin's inherent volatility.  The large expected return highlights the potential, but also the risk inherent in a highly volatile asset.
* **Price Change:** The recent price change (-2.42%) reflects a small downward movement, not a dramatic crash.


**Overall Conclusion:**

BTC-USD has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but it is subject to extreme volatility.  Current indicators suggest an oversold market, potentially signaling a short-term bounce, but the high risk level necessitates caution.  The high expected return over the long term is attractive, but investors should be prepared for substantial fluctuations and potential losses along the way.  Long-term, value-based investing strategies, potentially including dollar-cost averaging, may be more suitable for mitigating the inherent risk in this highly volatile asset.
