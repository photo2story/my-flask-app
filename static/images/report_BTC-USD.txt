## BTC-USD Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

BTC-USD, or Bitcoin, is a decentralized digital currency.  The cumulative return of BTC-USD is 8758.08%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 127.58%. The difference is 8630.5%, representing the maximum divergence observed historically.

This substantial outperformance highlights the high volatility and potentially higher risk associated with Bitcoin.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures show significant historical growth, while the high Alpha values consistently demonstrate outperformance against the benchmark. However, the Beta values, particularly in later years, indicate increasing sensitivity to market movements.  The fluctuating market capitalization reflects the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 98997.66
* **Last Market Price:** 96214.2
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 94945.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 84597.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 71948.02

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  However, the relatively small difference between the closing and last market price indicates recent price stability or consolidation.  The gap between the closing price and the 20 and 60-day moving averages also reveals a recent surge.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 83.97 - This indicates the asset is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction may be imminent.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.83 - A positive PPO suggests upward momentum, but the magnitude is moderate.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 29.67 (+) -  This points to a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 82.3% - This represents a significantly higher expected return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  This should be interpreted cautiously given the inherent volatility.
* **96214.2 (Last Market Price):**  The difference between the closing price and the last market price is relatively small, suggesting no significant immediate price shock (neither a sharp jump nor a dramatic fall).


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

**7. Summary:**

BTC-USD has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, but this comes with considerably higher risk due to its volatility. Recent price action shows upward momentum, although technical indicators (RSI) suggest an overbought condition. The expected return is high but highly uncertain.
