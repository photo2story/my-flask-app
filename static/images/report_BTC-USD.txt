*   **Analysis:** Bitcoin has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period, as evidenced by the substantial cumulative return divergence. The relative divergence of 64.1 indicates that the current performance is well above the historical midpoint but not at the peak.  The CAGR figures show substantial annual growth in most periods, but with significant volatility as illustrated by the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) which is consistently high.  The Alpha values are essentially mirroring the CAGR, indicating that Bitcoin's returns are largely independent of the market. The Beta values, while generally low, show an increasing trend, suggesting a slightly growing correlation with the market over time, before decreasing again, implying the correlation might vary widely from time to time. The Market cap figures are in Billions, and growing over time. The negative CAGR for the 2021-2023 period highlights the potential for significant losses.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 87873.5625
*   **Last-market:** `{'price': 87859.016, 'previousClose': 87512.875, 'change': 0.4}`
*   **5-day SMA:** 87754.6562
*   **20-day SMA:** 87715.566
*   **60-day SMA:** 92149.96

*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the price is significantly below the 60-day SMA, indicating that the longer-term trend might still be downwards or consolidating. The `last-market` data shows a small positive change, indicating a slight recent increase in price.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 65.52238234741523
*   **PPO:** 0.2985
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_1%_Buy 100% of cash (20 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 1% on 2025-10-26)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 1217.8

*   **Analysis:** The high MRI (0.9) suggests that the current market conditions are considered favorable for investment. The RSI of 65.52 is approaching overbought territory (above 70), suggesting that the price may soon experience a correction or consolidation. The PPO is positive but relatively low, indicating that the shorter-term moving average is slightly above the longer-term average. However the divergence change being negative indicates that the short term gains are lower than before. The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, but with a very conservative cash allocation, reflecting the inherent risks of investing in a volatile asset like Bitcoin. The extremely high Expected Return should be viewed with caution, as it represents a highly optimistic scenario and may not be realistic given the volatility of Bitcoin.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis & Summary**

Bitcoin has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial volatility, as highlighted by the high MDD values. Recent price action indicates a short-term upward trend, but the longer-term trend is less clear. The high MRI suggests favorable market conditions, but the RSI approaching overbought territory warrants caution. The news flow is mixed, with both positive price predictions and reports of price reversals. The expected return is high, but should be viewed with skepticism.

**Overall, Bitcoin remains a high-risk, high-reward investment.** While the MRI suggests a favorable environment and long-term potential, the significant volatility and potential for sharp reversals require investors to exercise caution and carefully manage their risk exposure. The lack of analyst consensus data further reinforces the speculative nature of this asset. It is important to consider both the potential upside and downside before making any investment decisions. It is also important to note that the hybrid signal suggests a small allocation in cash is recommended. The short term divergence indicates downward momentum in the short term.
