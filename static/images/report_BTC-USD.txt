## BTC-USD Stock Report

**0) Overview:**

BTC-USD, or Bitcoin, is a decentralized digital currency.  The following report analyzes its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

* **BTC-USD Cumulative Return:** 5620.56%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 116.17%
* **Return Difference:** 5504.39%  (BTC-USD significantly outperformed VOO)
* **Relative Divergence:** 77.8% (This indicates BTC-USD's performance is in the upper 77.8th percentile relative to its historical range of divergence from VOO.)


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows extremely high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for BTC-USD in several periods, particularly 2015-2017, 2019-2021 and 2022-2024, exceeding 2983%, 3940% and 2736% respectively. However, the high Beta values suggest significant volatility and correlation with market movements. The negative CAGR in 2021-2023 highlights the significant risk associated with Bitcoin investment.  Note that the Alpha values show a high degree of outperformance relative to the market in later years.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $84,373.01
* **Last Market Price:** $87,558.31
* **Previous Close:** $94,292.24
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $86,715.72
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $94,214.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $97,689.12

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The large negative change from the previous close (-7.14%) indicates a significant drop.  This is consistent with the RSI and PPO indicators.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 17.94  (Significantly below 30, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.42 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -11.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, 2+ years):** 1085.8% (This is a *projected* excess return over the S&P 500, assuming continued outperformance. This is highly uncertain given Bitcoin's extreme volatility.)
* **Price Change Impact:** The significant price drop from the previous close ($94,292.24 to $87,558.31) reinforces the bearish trend indicated by other indicators.  While not a "crash", the drop is substantial and warrants caution.

**Conclusion:**

BTC-USD shows a history of high returns but also extreme volatility. While currently oversold, the substantial price drop and negative momentum indicators suggest continued risk. The projected long-term outperformance is highly speculative and relies on Bitcoin maintaining its historical tendency to significantly outperform the market, which is not guaranteed.  Investors should proceed with caution and consider their risk tolerance before investing in Bitcoin.
