**6. Overall Analysis:**

Bitcoin shows a strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this outperformance comes with significant volatility and risk, as clearly demonstrated by the high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures.  While recent price action is above its moving averages, the negative PPO suggests potential bearish momentum. The extremely high projected long-term return needs to be interpreted in the context of this inherent volatility.  Before making any investment decisions, thoroughly research current market conditions, regulatory landscapes, and technological developments impacting Bitcoin.  Remember that past performance is not indicative of future results, and significant losses are possible.  Consider diversifying your portfolio to manage risk.  Always consult a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
