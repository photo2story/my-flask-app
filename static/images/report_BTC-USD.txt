The Expected Return is high, but it is important to remember that this is just an estimate based on historical data.

**Overall Analysis:**
BTC-USD has demonstrated a strong performance against the S&P 500, with a significantly higher return. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potential downtrend. The RSI and PPO are both indicating oversold conditions and a bearish trend, respectively.  While the high Expected Return may be tempting, investors should be cautious given the current market conditions and Bitcoin's inherent volatility.  Ultimately, the decision to invest in BTC-USD should be made based on a thorough understanding of the risks and potential rewards involved.
