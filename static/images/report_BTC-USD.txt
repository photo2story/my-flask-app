**0) Report:**

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Ticker:** BTC-USD
*   **Company:** Bitcoin (Decentralized digital currency operating on blockchain technology.)
*   **Bitcoin Cumulative Return:** 3886.19%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 99.09%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 3787.1
    *   Relative Divergence: 62.2% (This indicates Bitcoin's current divergence from the S&P 500 is in the 62.2nd percentile of its historical divergence range.)

**Analysis:** Bitcoin has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. The substantial positive divergence suggests a strong period of relative outperformance. However, the relative divergence percentile indicates Bitcoin's outperformance is not at its highest historical level.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 2946.0%  | 69.7%  | 2918.0%  | -0.0   | 283.7  |

| 2020-2022  | 616.0%   | 79.2%  | 617.0%   | 0.2    | 331.6  |

| 2022-2024  | 2208.0%  | 76.0%  | 2187.0%  | 0.3    | 1872.5 |
| 2023-2025  | 1647.0%  | 73.4%  | 1584.0%  | 0.2    | 1705.2 |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows impressive growth across most periods, although there's a negative CAGR for 2021-2023.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant volatility and risk. A drawdown near 80% is very substantial.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is extremely high in most periods, indicating significant outperformance compared to a benchmark.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is very low, indicating little correlation with the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization is displayed in billions, and it shows how the market capitalization of Bitcoin has grown.

**Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta analysis confirms Bitcoin's high-growth, high-risk profile. It generates substantial excess returns (high Alpha) but experiences large drawdowns. The low Beta suggests Bitcoin's price movements are largely independent of the overall stock market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 85085.22
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 85416.17, Previous Close: 86196.79, Change: -0.91%
*   **5-day SMA:** 86920.97
*   **20-day SMA:** 89893.74
*   **60-day SMA:** 97499.11

**Analysis:** The current price is below the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The -0.91% change since the previous close reinforces this downward momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO Index, and Divergence Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 30.93 (Approaching oversold conditions)
*   **PPO:** -0.1987 (Below zero, indicating bearish momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (48 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.0 (Indicates a short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 2762.3%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI is close to the oversold threshold (typically below 30), potentially indicating a buying opportunity if the downtrend reverses.
*   The negative PPO confirms the bearish short-term trend.
*   The hybrid signal has high MRI level (0.90)
*   The negative change in relative divergence suggests Bitcoin is losing ground relative to the S&P 500 in the short term.
*   The extremely high expected return suggests long-term bullish sentiment.

**Analysis:** The news headlines paint a mixed picture. There's both positive sentiment (Bitwise prediction of all-time highs) and negative sentiment (crash fears, price slides, Strategy's stock performance relative to Bitcoin's peak). The volatility is evident in the mention of a $90K spike followed by a reversal.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Bitcoin's performance is characterized by high growth, high volatility, and low correlation with the traditional stock market. While the long-term expected return remains extremely high, recent data indicates a short-term downtrend.

*   **Strengths:** Very high historical returns, strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500, potential for future growth (as per Bitwise prediction).
*   **Weaknesses:** High volatility (large drawdowns), recent price decline, negative short-term momentum (as indicated by SMAs, PPO, and recent divergence change), and mixed news sentiment.
*   **Key Considerations:** The current RSI near oversold levels may present a buying opportunity, but caution is warranted given the negative short-term trends and volatility. The divergence between the positive long-term outlook and the negative short-term indicators suggests a period of uncertainty.

**In summary:** Bitcoin offers the potential for substantial returns but carries significant risk. Investors should be aware of the volatility and the possibility of further short-term declines, while also considering the long-term growth potential. Further analysis of the specific factors driving the recent downturn (e.g., regulatory concerns, macroeconomic conditions) would be beneficial.
