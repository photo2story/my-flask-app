### 4. Recent News & Events

*   **[2025-10-22] Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq fall as Netflix sinks, Tesla earnings loom (Yahoo Finance) -** [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-fall-as-netflix-sinks-tesla-earnings-loom-182937566.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-nasdaq-fall-as-netflix-sinks-tesla-earnings-loom-182937566.html)

**Analysis:** The general market downturn reflected in the headline could be contributing to downward pressure on Bitcoin. The potential for negative earnings news from major companies like Tesla can increase overall market uncertainty, affecting risk assets like Bitcoin.

### 5. Overall Assessment

Bitcoin has demonstrated exceptional historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, current indicators suggest short-term weakness and higher risks. The negative shift in relative divergence, combined with moving average positioning, indicates potential for further price declines. The hybrid signal, with its recommendation to sell and hold a large cash position, further reinforces this concern.

The high MRI score might seem contradictory, but it's crucial to remember that it's a general indicator and doesn't negate the specific short-term risks highlighted by other signals.

**Recommendation:** Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted. Consider the potential for short-term declines, but also recognize the long-term potential. Closely monitor market news and technical indicators for confirmation of trends. If the news is bad and the hybrid signal is still sell, it might be wise to sell 78.5%
