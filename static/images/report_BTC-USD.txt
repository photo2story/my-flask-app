## 1️⃣ Return Comparison & Divergence  
- **BTC outperformed VOO by a staggering 1,891 % in cumulative return**.  
- The *relative divergence* of **68.8 %** places Bitcoin in the top two‑thirds of its historical volatility band, indicating that it’s still in a growth phase but has approached upper‑range momentum.  
- The large spread also underlines the risk premium: investors can expect much higher upside but also a much steeper downside compared to the S&P 500.
