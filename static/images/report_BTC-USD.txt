* **Expected Return:** 1871.9% (This is a very high expected return,  reflecting the inherent volatility and potential high reward/high risk nature of Bitcoin.

**Overall:**

BTC-USD has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly, but with substantially higher volatility. Current indicators show an overbought market with strong momentum, suggesting a potential correction.  The high expected return should be viewed cautiously, recognizing the considerable risk involved.  A long-term investment strategy should account for this high volatility and potential for substantial price swings.  The negative CAGR in 2021-2023 serves as a strong reminder of the potential for significant drawdowns.
