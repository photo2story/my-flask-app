*   **Alpha:** The high alpha values align with the high CAGR, meaning Bitcoin has consistently outperformed its expected return based on its risk (beta).
*   **Beta:** The beta values, ranging from 0.3 to 1.3, suggest that Bitcoin's volatility is sometimes, but not always, directionally correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). A beta above 1 indicates higher volatility than the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization increased significantly throughout the measured periods, showing increased investor interest, with a minor correction during the 2021-2023 period.

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 65.52 (Approaching overbought territory, but not yet extreme.)
*   **PPO:** 0.2985 (Positive, indicating that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which is generally bullish.)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_1%_Buy 100% of cash (20 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 1% on 2025-10-26) - Indicating a strong buy signal from the system.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (Negative, indicating short-term decline relative to the S&P 500.)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 3612.4 (Very high, projecting significant outperformance over the long term compared to the S&P 500.)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests that investment is "Highly Recommended".
*   The RSI is approaching overbought, which can sometimes signal a potential pullback.
*   The PPO being positive is a bullish sign.
*   The hybrid signal of "Buy 100% of cash" with a "Very Safe" label is a strong indication of a bullish outlook from the system, given the high MRI.
*   Despite the overall bullish signals, the recent negative divergence change suggests some short-term weakness.
*   The extraordinarily high expected return should be taken with caution, as it's a projection and Bitcoin's volatility makes long-term predictions difficult.
