*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR demonstrates the annualized growth rate over the period. Bitcoin showed enormous growth in the 2019-2021 period (1570.0%). However, the period 2021-2023 saw a significant negative return (-205.0%). The CAGR demonstrates the potential for substantial gains but also highlights the inherent volatility.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. High drawdowns demonstrate potential risk. The MDD remains relatively high across all periods, showing significant potential for value declines.
*   **Alpha:**  The excess return of the investment relative to a benchmark. In this data, it shows the excess return over S\&P500 index. High positive alpha indicates that Bitcoin significantly outperformed the benchmark.
*   **Beta:**  Measures the volatility of an investment compared to the market (here the comparison is to the S&P 500 index). A Beta of 1 indicates the asset's price will move with the market. Beta values fluctuated, but were mainly below 1.0, indicating that Bitcoin was less volatile than the S&P 500 index.
*   **Cap(B):** Indicates the hypothetical capitalization in Billions after a period of holding Bitcoin, based on starting with a relatively small amount.

    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The -0.6 change in relative divergence over the last 20 days indicates a recent decline relative to the comparison asset (S&P 500).
