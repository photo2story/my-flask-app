2025-11-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the provided data, including simple analysis and a comprehensive summary.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (BTC-USD vs. VOO)**

*   **BTC-USD (Bitcoin):** A decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network.
*   **Cumulative Return (BTC-USD):** 4020.1188%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 94.6370%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 3760.8
    *   Relative Divergence: 61.8

**Analysis:** Bitcoin's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500. The divergence of 3760.8 is substantial.  The relative divergence of 61.8 indicates that the current divergence is positioned in the middle of its historical range. This means the current difference between Bitcoin's and the S&P 500's returns isn't at an extreme high or low relative to their past performance.

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth rate over the period.  CAGR has been very high, but with significant fluctuations, including a negative period (2021-2023).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. High MDD figures across all periods demonstrate Bitcoin's inherent volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Represents the excess return compared to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500, though not explicitly stated). Positive Alpha indicates outperformance. Bitcoin's Alpha is generally very high, but also negative for 2021-2023.
*   **Beta:** Measures the asset's volatility relative to the market (S&P 500). A Beta of 0 suggests Bitcoin has little correlation to the S&P 500, indicating that Bitcoin's price movements are largely independent of the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization in Billions. Shows growth, but also fluctuation.

**Analysis:** The table confirms Bitcoin's high-growth potential, coupled with significant risk. The high MDD figures underscore the potential for substantial losses. The Alpha suggests Bitcoin can deliver returns above the market, when it is positive. The Beta indicates it is not tied to the S\&P500.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 87309.84
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 87372.66, 'previousClose': 84679.15, 'change': 3.18}
*   **5-day SMA:** 86861.61
*   **20-day SMA:** 97137.00
*   **60-day SMA:** 107973.77

**Analysis:** The price closed higher than the previous day. The 5-day SMA is below the current price, indicating a short-term upward trend. However, the 20-day and 60-day SMAs are significantly higher, suggesting a longer-term downward trend.  This discrepancy suggests a possible recent price rebound within a larger correction.

**3) Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 25.95 (Oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.32
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (48 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -6.3 (단기하락 - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 2730.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A "Medium Investment" recommendation suggests a moderate level of risk is perceived.
*   **RSI:** The oversold RSI indicates that Bitcoin may be undervalued and could be due for a price correction upwards.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests a downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Recommends buying bitcoin.
*   **Divergence Change:** Confirms a recent short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return suggests significant potential upside over the long term, but should be considered in light of the demonstrated volatility.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Headlines:** Multiple headlines highlight a recent decline in Bitcoin's price, attributing it to various factors like stock market movements and broader economic concerns.
*   **MicroStrategy Concerns:** The article about MicroStrategy potentially being removed from stock indices if Bitcoin falls further adds to the negative sentiment.
*   **Stock Market Correlation:** Some articles point to a correlation between Bitcoin and the stock market.

Bitcoin has shown tremendous growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the long term. However, this growth comes with substantial volatility, as evidenced by high Maximum Drawdown figures and recent price declines.

Recent news is largely negative, focusing on price drops, potential negative impacts on companies like MicroStrategy, and possible correlations with the struggling stock market.
