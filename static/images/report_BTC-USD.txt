This results in a substantial divergence of 9332.37, placing it within the top 77.95% of historical performance against VOO. 

The alpha and beta analysis showcases Bitcoin's volatility and potential for high returns, but also underscores its susceptibility to market downturns. Its alpha consistently demonstrates outperformance compared to the benchmark, particularly in periods like 2015-2017 and 2019-2021. However, its beta, reflecting the correlation with the market, has gradually increased over time, indicating a growing sensitivity to broader market movements.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI (56.87) suggests the asset is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating potential for further price movement in either direction. The PPO (-0.4) signals a slight bearish trend, potentially indicating a short-term pullback. The recent 20-day relative divergence of 7.27 (+), suggests a short-term upward trend. The substantial increase in the last-market price (75423.29) compared to the closing price (69583.09) indicates a potential rapid surge in the recent market. 

The expected return of 255.24% represents a significant potential for outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2 years or more).
