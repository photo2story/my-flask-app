## Report: BTC-USD Performance Analysis

**0. Key Figures & Initial Observations:**

BTC-USD, representing Bitcoin's price in USD, shows significantly higher cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  However, recent performance has been more volatile, with periods of substantial gains and losses.  The high volatility is reflected in its large maximum drawdown (MDD) values.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **Company Overview:** BTC-USD is the price of Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency.
* **BTC-USD Cumulative Return:** 5803.21%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 89.44%
* **Return Difference (as of the last data point):** 5713.77%  This illustrates the massive outperformance of Bitcoin compared to the S&P 500, although this is significantly influenced by Bitcoin's higher volatility.
* **Relative Divergence:** 81.0 This indicates that the current price difference between BTC-USD and VOO is towards the higher end of the historical range of differences. It does *not* imply a 81% superior performance, but rather a high percentile rank based on historical divergences.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided table shows highly variable CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), reflecting Bitcoin's volatile nature.  While Alpha (excess return over the benchmark) is generally low or positive, the Beta (volatility relative to the benchmark) is substantially higher than 1 in most periods, confirming its extreme risk profile. The substantial market cap (Cap(B)) growth is notable but must be viewed in context of its high risk.


| Year       | CAGR      | MDD  | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 3005.0%   | 19.2% | 2988.0% | 0.0   | 290.9 |
| 2016-2018  | 467.0%    | 36.4% | 461.0%  | 0.0   | 74.3  |
| 2017-2019  | 691.0%    | 36.4% | 672.0%  | 0.0   | 142.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 1162.0%   | 36.4% | 1128.0% | 0.1   | 575.5 |
| 2019-2021  | 3938.0%   | 38.2% | 3865.0% | 0.1   | 919.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 373.0%    | 38.2% | 362.0%  | 0.1   | 329.5 |
| 2021-2023  | -177.0%   | 38.2% | -195.0% | 0.5   | 835.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 3146.0%   | 65.0% | 3124.0% | 0.4   | 1854.1|
| 2023-2025  | 3680.0%   | 65.0% | 3639.0% | 0.3   | 1687.3|


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 85024.08
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 83371.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 84480.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 89841.99

The price is currently below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, the price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating some short-term support.  The recent price change (`change`: 3.01%) reflects a positive move from the previous day.  This is not a "significant" change in terms of percentages for this asset.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4382 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.99 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.1442 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.0% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term, 2+ years):** 1112.4%  This high expected return reflects the historical extreme return variability of this asset class.  It should be interpreted with significant caution due to the inherent volatility of Bitcoin.


**Conclusion:**

BTC-USD has historically delivered significantly higher returns than the S&P 500, but this comes with substantially higher risk.  The recent price action shows some short-term weakness, but overall indicators suggest a mixed outlook.  The projected long-term expected return is extremely high but must be viewed in light of the extreme risk and volatility inherent in Bitcoin investments.  Any investment decision should be made after carefully considering personal risk tolerance and conducting thorough due diligence.
