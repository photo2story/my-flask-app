2024-12-10 - Analysis Report
## Bitcoin (BTC-USD) Investment Report

**1. Performance Overview:**

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

The cumulative return of BTC-USD is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for BTC-USD is 6779.96%, while the S&P 500 shows a cumulative return of 122.19%. This results in a substantial divergence of 6657.8 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 100.0% indicates that the current performance is at the highest point observed historically relative to the S&P 500.  However, this high relative divergence should be viewed with caution, as historical performance is not indicative of future results, and the extreme volatility of Bitcoin is evident in the provided CAGR data.  The CAGR data shows periods of extremely high returns followed by periods of significant negative returns, highlighting the high risk associated with Bitcoin.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently high alpha values across different periods, indicating significant outperformance relative to a benchmark (although the benchmark isn't specified). However, the extremely high beta values (e.g., 290.0 in 2015-2017) underscore the extreme volatility and market sensitivity of Bitcoin.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $99,920.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $97,430.06
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $95,770.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $79,716.74

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. The Last-market price of $96,442.05 is slightly below the closing price, indicating a minor price adjustment.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 51.83 -  Indicates a relatively neutral market condition.  Neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.80 - Suggests a bearish momentum, although it's close to zero.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.6 -  Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative strength.

The fact that the last-market price ($96,442.05) is slightly lower than the closing price does not indicate a significant event (like a sharp drop or rebound). The difference is minimal and likely within the normal daily price fluctuations.

* **Expected Return:** 3270.2% -  This represents a significant expected return over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), assuming continued historical trends. However, this should be interpreted with extreme caution due to the high volatility and risk inherent in Bitcoin.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Bitcoin shows extremely high returns compared to the S&P 500 over the historical period examined. However, this comes with exceptionally high volatility and risk, as evidenced by the large swings in CAGR and the high beta values. The current technical indicators suggest a relatively neutral market condition, with a slightly bearish PPO but a positive relative divergence suggesting short-term upward momentum. The high expected return should be considered in light of the significant risks involved.  It is crucial to conduct thorough due diligence and understand the risks before investing in Bitcoin.  The current price is above its moving averages, indicating a bullish short-term trend.  However, long-term projections should consider past volatility.  The addition of current market news would allow for a more comprehensive analysis.
