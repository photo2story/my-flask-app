### 1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO)

**Key Numbers:**

*   **ARKX Cumulative Return:** 59.34%

**Analysis:**

ARKX has outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in cumulative return, currently sitting at 59.34% compared to VOO's 49.45%.  However, the "Spread" metrics show a more nuanced picture. While ARKX is currently outperforming, its spread relative to VOO has fluctuated significantly, ranging from a maximum outperformance of 5.7% to underperformance of -35.2%. The fact that the relative spread position is at 92.7 suggests that the current outperformance is near the higher end of its historical range compared to VOO.  This doesn't necessarily mean it *will* revert, but it is worth noting.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI of 0.9 suggests that the market conditions are generally favorable for investment, but it is important to note this is a general indicator and not specific to ARKX.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 86.91 is extremely high, indicating that ARKX is significantly overbought. This often suggests a potential pullback or consolidation in the near term.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is positive, confirming the upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 100% of cash" signal reinforces the bullish sentiment, suggesting the system recommends full investment in ARKX.
*   **Relative Spread Change:** The +24.0 change in relative spread over the past 20 days indicates a strong recent outperformance of ARKX compared to VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** A negative expected return of -3.6% suggests that, based on the model, long-term returns from the current price may underperform the S&P 500. This should be further researched by other data.

**Impact of Price Change:**

The significant 1.88% price change today likely contributes to the overbought RSI reading and reinforces the recent upward momentum. This rapid price increase could be due to recent news or events related to space exploration or holdings within the ARKX ETF.

### 4. Recent News & Events

### 4-2. Analyst Opinions
*   **Analyst Consensus:** No Data

### 5. Overall Assessment

ARKX has shown strong recent performance, outperforming the S&P 500 and hitting a 52-week high.  However, several factors suggest caution:

*   **High Volatility:** The consistently high MDD indicates significant risk.
*   **Overbought Condition:** The extremely high RSI signals that ARKX may be due for a pullback.
*   **Spread Fluctuation:** The historical spread between ARKX and VOO has been highly variable.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The model suggests potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the long term.
*   **Analyst Consensus:** No analyst consensus data, which can be seen as negative because this data point is missing.

**Conclusion:**

ARKX presents a mixed picture. The ETF's recent momentum and positive news are encouraging, but the high volatility, overbought condition, and negative expected return warrant careful consideration.  Investors should weigh the potential for continued short-term gains against the inherent risks and potential for long-term underperformance. Monitoring the fund's holdings and any news related to the space exploration sector is crucial.
