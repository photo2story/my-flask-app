**Report: ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (ARKX) Analysis**

**1. Performance Overview & Comparative Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** ARKX
*   **Company Overview:** ARKX is an ETF focused on companies leading, enabling, or benefiting from space exploration and innovation.

**Key Performance Metrics:**

*   **Cumulative Return (ARKX):** 41.06%
*   **Cumulative Return (S&P 500/VOO):** 47.40%
*   **Disparity (vs. VOO):**
    *   **Current Difference:** 1.8%
    *   **Range (Max: 13.0, Min: -27.3)**
    *   **Relative Disparity:** 72.2
    *   This indicates ARKX's performance relative to VOO is in the upper range of its historical disparity, suggesting it is currently performing relatively well within its historical context compared to the S&P 500, but still underperforming overall.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| 2021-2023  | -7.0%   | 80.5%  | -10.0% | 0.1   | 0.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 22.0%   | 80.5%  | 2.0%   | 0.0   | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 59.0%   | 80.5%  | -3.0%  | -0.0  | 0.0    |

*   **Analysis:**  The CAGR fluctuates significantly across different periods, reflecting the volatility of the space exploration sector. The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) of 80.5% across all periods is a major concern, signaling substantial risk.  Alpha is inconsistent, indicating that ARKX's performance is not consistently outperforming or underperforming its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis. Beta values close to zero suggest that ARKX's performance is relatively independent of the broader market (S&P 500).

**5. 종합 Summary & Recommendations**

ARKX shows a mixed picture. While recent price action is positive, with the price above key moving averages, the high RSI suggests it may be overbought. The fund's historical volatility (high MDD) remains a significant risk factor. The negative expected return raises concerns about long-term performance relative to the S&P 500.
However, high MRI and the buying more Nvidia stock and recent market volatility offers opportunities.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Cautious Outlook:** Given the high MDD and the potential for underperformance versus the S&P 500, investors should exercise caution.
*   **Monitor RSI:**  Watch for signs of overbought conditions and potential pullbacks.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** ARKX is focused on a high-growth, high-risk sector. A long-term investment horizon is necessary to weather the volatility.
