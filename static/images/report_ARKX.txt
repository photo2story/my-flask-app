The table provides performance metrics for ARKX over rolling three-year periods:

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Fluctuates significantly. A positive 56% CAGR from 2023-2025, versus a negative -7% CAGR from 2021-2023 shows that the ETF's performance depends heavily on the time frame.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

ARKX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) as of the latest data. The negative divergence highlights this. The high MDD and fluctuating CAGR in the table also point to a high risk-high reward investment.  Beta of 0.0 means that ARKX does not behave similar to the S&P 500.

The recent news is a mixed bag. The positive articles about high growth in 2026 and hitting a 52-week high is bullish.
The technical indicators provide a mixed view. The RSI approaching oversold territory could signal a potential buying opportunity. However, the negative expected return and the recent decline in relative divergence suggest caution. The MRI of 0.8 indicates a medium level of investment risk. The signal shows a strong buy and that it has 0% in cash on 2025-12-03.

**In summary:**

ARKX is a high-risk, high-reward investment that has underperformed the broader market recently. The sector it focuses on has potentially high growth in the future, but it also has high volatility. The investor should be prepared for significant price swings. The strong buy is a potential buy signal if investors believe in the future growth of the space exploration industry.
