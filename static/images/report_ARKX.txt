    *   **High Volatility:** MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high at 80.5% across all periods, suggesting significant downside risk.
    *   **Low Correlation with Market:** Beta is very low (around 0), indicating that ARKX's returns are not strongly correlated with the overall market.  This could be because the companies it invest in have idiosyncratic risks and returns compared to the market in general.
