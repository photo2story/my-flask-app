**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

|            | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|----------|-------|--------|
| 2022-2024  | 19.0%   | 81.2%   | -11.0%  | 1.2   | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 107.0% | 81.2%   | 39.0%  | 1.3   | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows strong growth potential, especially in the most recent period (2023-2025).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** A significant risk factor, indicating large potential losses. The 81.2% drawdown is a major concern.
*   **Alpha:**  Measures risk-adjusted performance. Negative alpha (-11.0%) in the earlier period means underperformance relative to its risk.  Positive alpha (39.0%) in the later period indicates outperformance.
*   **Beta:**  Measures volatility relative to the market (S&P 500). A Beta of 1.2-1.3 suggests that ARKX is more volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** The data is showing a value of 0.0, which is unusual and needs to be confirmed if it is valid.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Previous Close:** 29.19
*   **Change:** -0.72%
*   **5-day SMA:** 29.406
*   **20-day SMA:** 28.8585
*   **60-day SMA:** 29.1501

**Analysis:**

The stock price has recently decreased. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend.  However, the 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA, which could indicate a more sustained downward trend or consolidation.  The small negative change from the previous close suggests a slight downward pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.87 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.2354 (Positive)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (7 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -8.6 (Negative)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests high investment potential, however, this rating should be regarded with caution given the high MDD and the underperformance to the S&P 500.
*   **RSI:** An RSI around 50 is considered neutral, meaning the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating a potential upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The system suggests a buy signal.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence indicates that the stock has been underperforming the S&P 500 recently.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 0.0% suggests that the model does not project significant outperformance or underperformance compared to holding cash, and/or it is already priced into the risk and expected returns.
