*   **Alpha:** Alpha has turned negative from 3.0% to -1.0%, suggesting that ARKX's performance, adjusted for risk, is now underperforming relative to its benchmark. This indicates that recent performance is more attributable to market movements than to ARKX's specific stock picks.

**Analysis:**

*   The recent closing price (30.02) is above all three SMAs (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), which initially suggests an upward trend.
*   However, the 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, and the 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA, which can be interpreted as a weakening of the short-term upward momentum or a potential consolidation phase.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -8.5 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -9.1

**Analysis:**

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days signals a potential short-term downward trend compared to VOO.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   No Analyst Consensus Data was provided.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

ARKX, while showing a slight outperformance against the S&P 500 in cumulative return, presents a complex investment picture. The high Beta indicates higher volatility, and the recent negative Alpha suggests that recent gains are primarily market-driven rather than due to ARKX's stock selection.

The technical indicators are somewhat contradictory. The positive PPO and price position above SMAs suggest recent upward momentum, but the negative change in relative divergence and the negative expected return raise concerns about a potential short-term decline. The MRI indicates medium risk.

The news headlines are a mixed bag, with positive momentum signals tempered by concerns about volatility and increasing competition in the space exploration ETF market.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this data, ARKX appears to be a moderately risky investment with potentially weakening short-term momentum and negative return expectations. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance, conduct further due diligence, and monitor the competitive landscape and ARKX's stock selection to make an informed decision. The lack of analyst consensus data also underscores the need for independent research.
