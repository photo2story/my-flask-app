## ARKX (ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF) Analysis

**Company Overview:** ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (ARKX) focuses on companies involved in space exploration and innovation.

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

**Key Numbers:**

*   ARKX Cumulative Return: 29.29%
*   VOO Cumulative Return: 44.62%
*   Absolute Divergence (ARKX - VOO): -15.33%
*   Relative Divergence: -11.2 (Range: -35.3 to 10.2, indicating a relative position of 53.0 within this range)

**Analysis:**

ARKX has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly. The cumulative return is lower. The negative divergence shows this underperformance. The "relative divergence" places the current difference toward the lower end of its historical range compared to VOO.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -7.0%  | 80.5% | -10.0%  | 0.1  | 0.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 22.0%  | 80.5% | 2.0%    | 0.0  | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025  | 47.0%  | 80.5% | -12.0%  | 0.0  | 0.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate varies greatly. It was negative for 2021-2023, and strong in the latter periods, showing high volatility.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high at 80.5%, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is inconsistent, being significantly negative in one period and positive in another. This suggests that the ETF's performance is not consistently outperforming or underperforming its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Beta is very low (near 0), implying very low correlation with the market (S&P500). It means ARKX's returns are not strongly tied to the overall market movements, which can be a good thing if the market is down, but also means it might not benefit as much when the market is up.
*   **Cap:** Cap is consistently at 0.0, which seems unusual. It may indicate a very small fund size or a reporting issue.

*   20-Day Moving Average: 28.9577
*   60-Day Moving Average: 28.6742

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** The low RSI indicates that the stock is oversold, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity (but should be confirmed with other indicators).
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests a bearish trend.
*   **Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms recent underperformance compared to VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** The negative expected return suggests that, based on the model, ARKX is projected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** A "Buy" signal. This signal suggests buying all shares available based on cash, emphasizing its very safe and a medium investment approach.
*   **Price Change Reflection:** The price change of 1.05% reflects a slight rebound.

### 4. News & Analyst Opinions

**News:**

*   \[2025-10-03] Space Exploration ETF (ARKX) Hits New 52-Week High

**Analysis:**

*   The news of hitting a 52-week high is *seemingly* positive. However, given the other data, it's important to understand the context. Was this a brief spike? Is it sustainable? It contradicts with other signals, so further investigation is needed.

### 5. Summary

ARKX is a high-volatility ETF that has recently underperformed the S&P 500. While the RSI indicates it might be oversold, the negative PPO, negative expected return, and declining relative divergence suggest caution. The news of a 52-week high needs to be viewed in light of the other indicators, as it may be a temporary event. The very low Beta suggests that ARKX has a very weak relationship with the S\&P500, which implies returns are not tied to the overall market movements.
