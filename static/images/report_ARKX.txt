*   **Analysis of Alpha, Beta, etc. Table:**

|            Year      | CAGR   | MDD  | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|:-----------------|:-------|:-----|:--------|:-------|:-------|
| 2021-2023        | -7.0%  | 80.5% | -10.0%  | 0.1    | 0.0    |
| 2022-2024        | 22.0%  | 80.5% | 2.0%    | 0.0    | 0.0    |
| 2023-2025        | 64.0%  | 80.5% | -4.0%   | -0.0   | 0.0    |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows significant variability. The recent 2023-2025 period shows high growth (64%) after a period of negative growth. This volatility indicates a high-risk investment.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high (80.5%), confirming a very high level of risk/volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the investment's performance compared to the market.  The inconsistent Alpha values (-10%, 2%, -4%) suggest ARKX's performance is not consistently outperforming (or underperforming) the market based on its risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the investment's volatility compared to the market.  Beta values around 0 indicate that ARKX's price is not closely correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). This is to be expected for a niche ETF like ARKX.

*   **Conclusion (Return Rate Comparison):**  ARKX has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in cumulative return. The high volatility, high maximum drawdown, and inconsistent Alpha suggest that ARKX is a high-risk investment. The relative divergence indicates that the current divergence is closer to the average, compared to the maximum.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 29.52
*   **Previous Close:** 30.04
*   **Change:** -1.73% (decline)
*   **5-day SMA:** 29.82
*   **20-day SMA:** 28.57
*   **60-day SMA:** 29.24

*   **Analysis:** The current price is below the 5-day SMA, indicating a short-term downtrend.  The 5-day SMA is above the 60-day SMA.  The 20-day SMA is significantly lower than both the 5-day and 60-day SMA, suggesting a recent upward trend. However, the most recent price drop indicates a possible reversal of that upward trend.

**3)  RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 58.20 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.78 (Positive - suggesting an upward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 5.5% (Positive, indicates a short-term increase in divergence)
*   **Expected Return:** -8.9%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI Contradiction:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests high investment is recommended, while the expected return is negative and the news may not be good. This is contradictory and should be investigated further before investing.
    *   **RSI:** The RSI is in a neutral zone, not providing a clear buy or sell signal.
    *   **PPO:** A positive PPO supports the possibility of upward momentum.
    *   **Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests ARKX has slightly outperformed VOO in the very recent short term, but this is set against the overall negative divergence.
    *   **Last price change:** The recent price change indicates price fluctuation, showing that this is an important issue.
    *   **Expected Return:** A negative expected return over a 2-year period is a significant red flag, suggesting potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Data missing. No Analyst Consensus is provided.**

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

ARKX is a high-risk, high-volatility ETF focused on the space exploration and innovation sector. While it offers exposure to a potentially high-growth area, it has underperformed the S&P 500 in cumulative return. The high maximum drawdown and inconsistent Alpha reinforce the risk profile.

The recent price fluctuations indicate potential downward momentum, despite a previous upward trend. The RSI is neutral, and the PPO is positive, but the negative expected return is a significant concern.  The contradictory MRI needs further consideration.

The news articles present a mixed picture, with some highlighting the fund's potential and others emphasizing its volatility. The lack of analyst consensus data makes a definitive recommendation difficult.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the negative expected return, high volatility, and underperformance compared to the S&P 500, **ARKX is not recommended for risk-averse investors.** Those with a high-risk tolerance and a strong belief in the long-term potential of the space exploration sector may consider a small allocation, but should be aware of the potential for significant losses. Further research is necessary, especially reading the full articles mentioned and understanding the analyst consensus if available. The contradiction of the MRI and the lack of analyst consensus call for pausing investing, or reinvesting, in this particular stock.
