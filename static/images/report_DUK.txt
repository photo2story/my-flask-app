**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, despite relatively stable revenue and high profit margins.  The inconsistent earnings and fluctuating alpha suggest a less predictable investment compared to the broader market. Technical indicators offer mixed signals. The extremely negative long-term expected return (-286.9%) requires further investigation and clarification as this figure seems unrealistic.  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the methodology behind the expected return calculation and a thorough review of the company's financials and industry outlook are necessary.  Consideration should be given to the high maximum drawdowns observed in certain periods.
