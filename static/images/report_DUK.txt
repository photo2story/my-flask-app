This report analyzes Duke Energy Corp (DUK), a major energy holding company that engages in electric power generation, transmission, and distribution.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

DUK's cumulative return of 49.95% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 112.20%.  The difference is -62.2%, placing it at the 8.4th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500. This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market. The provided CAGR data from 2015-2025 further supports this underperformance, although the Alpha values suggest slight outperformance in some periods.  The Beta values consistently around 0.1 suggest very low correlation with the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $105.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $107.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $107.83
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $112.18

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.53 –  Near the neutral level, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.027 – Positive, suggesting a slightly bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.5 – Indicates a recent slight downward movement relative to the broader market.
* **Expected Return:** -320.0% – This extremely negative projected return needs further clarification.  A -320% return is highly improbable and suggests a significant error in the provided data.  The statement about long-term (2+ years) investment needs more detailed context, including investment strategy and risk tolerance to be meaningful.  The -320% figure appears to be a calculation error.

**7. Overall Summary:**

DUK shows consistent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  While recent financial statements demonstrate relatively stable revenue and high profit margins, the stock's price action and the provided (potentially erroneous) expected return suggest caution. The technical indicators are mixed.  Further investigation into the -320% expected return figure is crucial.  Before making any investment decision, a thorough risk assessment and analysis beyond the provided data is strongly recommended.  The low beta suggests low market correlation and possibly lower risk, but the underperformance relative to the market remains a significant concern.  The negative expected return figure requires immediate clarification.
