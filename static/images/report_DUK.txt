**7. Overall Conclusion:**

DUK has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the given period.  While financial indicators like revenue and profit margins are relatively strong, the stock's price action and technical indicators suggest a mixed outlook.  The relatively high MDD in the past highlights significant risk.  The -16.3% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) reinforces concern about its future prospects relative to the market.  Further investigation into specific factors driving the underperformance and a detailed analysis of future earnings expectations are crucial before making any investment decisions.  Considering the relatively high historical MDD, caution is warranted.
