## Duke Energy Corp (DUK) Stock Analysis Report

**Executive Summary:** Duke Energy Corp (DUK), a US-based electric power holding company, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While showing positive CAGR in recent years, its alpha is relatively low, and current technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment.  Recent earnings have been mixed, and the lack of readily available revenue and gross profit data hinders a comprehensive financial analysis.  A long-term investment strategy warrants careful consideration given the underperformance and high negative expected return.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

DUK's cumulative return of 57.57% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's 121.84% return.  This results in a large negative divergence (-64.3%), placing it at the 5.9th percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results. While CAGR has been positive and increasing until 2021, Alpha remains consistently low relative to the S&P 500 (generally below 1.0), indicating underperformance even during periods of positive growth.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has shown a gradual increase over the years.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values in several periods (reaching -47%) highlight significant downside risk.

Earnings have been mixed, with some quarters exceeding expectations and others falling short.  A consistent trend is not immediately apparent.

**5. Financial Information:**

No "Total Revenue" or "Gross Profit" data were provided, limiting a comprehensive assessment of the company's financial health and profitability.  This is a significant data gap that needs to be addressed for a thorough analysis.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

DUK has consistently underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. While recent CAGR figures appear positive, the low alpha and high MDD values indicate substantial risk.  The currently slightly bearish technical indicators and the extremely negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 raise serious concerns. The lack of crucial financial data (revenue and gross profit) further restricts a complete analysis.  Before considering a long-term investment, a more in-depth analysis including missing financial data and a review of the -488.4% expected return calculation is strongly recommended.  The current data suggests that DUK is a higher-risk investment compared to the broader market represented by the S&P 500.
