## Duke Energy Corp (DUK) Investment Review

This report analyzes Duke Energy Corp (DUK), a major US electric power holding company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

DUK's cumulative return of 54.57% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return of 120.91% over the measured period.  The difference is -66.3%, placing it at the 0.1 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently near 0.1 suggests that DUK's performance has largely tracked the market, although substantially underperforming. The beta consistently near 0.1 (though not explained) is unusual and inconsistent with typical beta values.  Further investigation is needed to understand this data.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $108.82
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $110.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $113.39
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $113.88

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (26.99):**  Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially signaling a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.58):**  Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-1.5):**  Confirms the short-term downtrend.

The provided "Expected Return" of 0.0% for long-term (2+ years) investment is concerning and warrants further scrutiny.  The low RSI suggests a potential for price increase, but the negative PPO and relative strength change indicate current bearish momentum.  A significant price jump (108.81) hasn't been observed, but the low RSI suggests that a potential bounce could occur, it's important to monitor the market carefully before making any investment decisions.  A comparison to the VOO's projected returns over a similar timeframe is needed to assess the "S&P 500-relative excess returns".

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some variability in EPS.  While some quarters beat expectations (2024-08-06, 2024-05-07, 2023-11-02), others fell short (2024-11-07, 2024-02-08). There's no clear trend in EPS growth based solely on this limited data.  More information on revenue growth is needed to provide a comprehensive analysis.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates, with no clear upward or downward trend.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are relatively stable, hovering around 49%, indicating consistent profitability.
* **Equity:** Equity is relatively stable, suggesting a stable financial position.
* **ROE:** ROE is also fluctuating, though generally remaining above 2%. This is a reasonable return but not exceptionally high for the sector.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within 2 days) earnings news or market outlook information was provided.  Similarly, analyst opinions and performance highlights are missing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DUK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. While some technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce (oversold RSI), the negative momentum (PPO) and downtrend (moving averages) point to continued bearish pressure.  Earnings have been mixed, with no clear trend in EPS growth.  The provided financial data displays consistent profitability and stable equity, but the relative underperformance against market benchmarks is a major concern. More information is needed, particularly on revenue growth trends, analyst opinions, and recent market news, to offer a more complete assessment of DUK's investment potential.  The provided beta data requires further clarification as it is unusually low.


**8. Recommendation:**

Given the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, mixed earnings, and lack of positive indicators in the recent price movement, a cautious approach is warranted.  Further due diligence is required before considering investment in DUK, especially considering the concerningly low and inconsistent beta provided.  Further research into company-specific news and a comparison of long-term returns with appropriate benchmarks is vital before making any investment decision.
