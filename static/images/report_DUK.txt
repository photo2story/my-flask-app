This report analyzes Duke Energy Corp (DUK), a U.S. electric power holding company that primarily operates in the southeastern United States, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

DUK's cumulative return (53.29%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (115.41%).  The provided divergence metrics show a substantial underperformance:  -62.1% compared to the S&P 500, placing it at the 8.5th percentile of its historical range of divergence (max: 15.4%, min: -69.3%). This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market over the observed period.  The Alpha consistently near 0.1 further reinforces this underperformance relative to the market, indicated by a Beta around 0.1 which points to a low market sensitivity (low volatility compared to the market).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $108.23
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $107.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $108.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $112.32

The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent minor price decline, potentially consolidating before a possible upward movement.  There is no indication of a significant recent, rapid price change (no indication of a “sharp drop” or “sharp recovery”).

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.69 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, nearing a neutral territory.
* **PPO:** 0.10 – A positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) – Indicates a minor downward trend in recent relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** -315.3% – This extremely negative expected return is likely an error in the provided data and needs further clarification.  It is highly improbable given other factors.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data shows some variability, but no clear consistent trend:

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|--------|--------------|------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 1.62   | 1.7          | Miss       |
| 2024-08-06 | 1.18   | 1.02         | Beat       |
| 2024-05-07 | 1.44   | 1.38         | Beat       |
| 2024-02-08 | 1.51   | 1.54         | Miss       |
| 2023-11-02 | 1.94   | 1.92         | Beat       |

There's no clear pattern of consistent beats or misses, and the reported EPS figures fluctuate.  Further analysis would require revenue data to assess profitability trends comprehensively.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions – data not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DUK's performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While its profit margins are relatively stable, the recent earnings show inconsistent results, and the price shows a slightly bearish sentiment.  The provided expected return of -315.3% is highly improbable and needs verification.  Additional information regarding recent news, analyst opinions and a more detailed analysis of revenue trends would be required for a comprehensive assessment.  The low beta reflects low market volatility, meaning that it is likely to underperform significantly in bull markets.  Given the current data, a long-term investment in DUK requires caution and careful consideration of its historical underperformance relative to the broader market.
