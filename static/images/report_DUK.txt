## Duke Energy Corp (DUK) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Duke Energy Corp (DUK) is a U.S.-based electric power holding company that operates primarily in the southeastern United States.  Over the observed period, DUK's cumulative return (64.55%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (124.78%).  The difference is -60.23%, placing it at the 12.14th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500. This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha and beta values show mixed results across different time periods, with alpha sometimes positive but often negative, indicating periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. Beta values generally suggest moderate market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 113.54
* **5-day Moving Average:** 111.29
* **20-day Moving Average:** 113.36
* **60-day Moving Average:** 114.19

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend but a longer-term downward trend.  The relatively close proximity of the moving averages indicates a relatively sideways trend, but the situation requires further analysis given the small timeframe considered.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (50.6):**  Indicates a relatively neutral market sentiment; neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO (-0.06):** Suggests a slightly bearish trend, as the PPO is below zero.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (-10.84):** Shows a recent short-term price decline relative to the market.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% suggests no significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is anticipated over a long-term (2+ years) horizon based on the current analysis.  This is consistent with the historical underperformance indicated by the cumulative return comparison.  This is a projection only and does not consider factors such as changes in investor sentiment, unexpected events or other fundamental data changes.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The recent earnings reports show mixed results compared to expectations.  While some quarters exceeded expectations (e.g., 2024-05-07 and 2023-11-02), others fell short (e.g., 2024-08-06). The most recent EPS (1.62) was slightly below the expectation (1.7).  A trend analysis is needed to draw conclusive statements.  Further investigation of the reasons for the variances is recommended.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Consistent revenue generation with relatively stable profit margins around 49%.  This data displays reasonable health in the company's financial operations.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity levels remain stable, with ROE fluctuating but generally remaining low at approximately 2%, potentially suggesting the need for higher earnings growth to improve returns.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires access to real-time news sources like Shacknews, FINBOLD, etc.  To complete this section, please provide me with links to relevant news articles published within the last two days.)*  A thorough analysis of recent news (including earnings announcements, analyst opinions, and market outlook) would provide crucial insights into recent performance and future expectations.

**7.  Comprehensive Analysis:**

DUK has exhibited underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the observed period. While the company shows consistent revenue and profitability, its return on equity remains relatively low. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term trend. The most recent earnings report shows a slight miss in expectations.  To make a conclusive assessment on future performance more context, such as an in-depth analysis of the recent news and updates on market outlook is needed.  The provided 0% expected return is based on the current state and does not suggest a high probability for future market-beating returns.

**8.  Recommendation:**

Based on the available data, a further investigation is necessary.  Additional analysis of recent news, analyst reports, and a deeper dive into the reasons behind underperformance against the market is needed before drawing definitive conclusions regarding investment decisions. The lack of substantial expected return suggests other investment choices may warrant consideration depending on the investor's risk tolerance and investment goals.  A longer-term investment requires a deeper understanding of the company's long-term strategies and its prospects within the changing energy landscape.
