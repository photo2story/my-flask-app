* **Closing Price:** $120.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $118.64
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $118.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $115.84

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent minor upward trend. However, it's still below the 60-day average, hinting at a potential short-term correction.  The price has recently slightly decreased (-0.09).


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.36 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.0938 (Negative; indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -19.2% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -1.2% (Negative implies an expected underperformance compared to S&P 500 over the long term given current conditions)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While RSI isn't overbought, the negative PPO and negative relative divergence suggest bearish momentum in the short term. The negative expected return warrants caution regarding long-term outperformance against the S&P 500.  The small recent price drop is not significant enough to suggest a major market event.
