### 7. 종합 분석

Duke Energy Corp (DUK) has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, and the negative expected return is a major concern. Despite positive short-term price movement and generally positive earnings surprises, long-term prospects appear weak based on this analysis. While the company demonstrates stable revenue, high profit margins, and low market risk, the low ROE and strong underperformance relative to the benchmark suggest investors should exercise caution. Recent news about business developments and market volatility should be monitored closely. Overall, a buy recommendation seems risky, and further investigation into the factors causing long-term underperformance is warranted.
