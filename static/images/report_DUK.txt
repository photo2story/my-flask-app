**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

DUK's cumulative return (59.85%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's return (117.48%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -57.6%, placing it at the 13.8th percentile relative to its historical range of performance against the S&P 500 (ranging from a maximum outperformance of 15.4% to a maximum underperformance of -69.3%).

The alpha and beta analysis reveals fluctuating performance relative to the market.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows increasing returns from 2015-2025,  alpha (market-adjusted return) varies widely, sometimes significantly positive, sometimes near zero or even negative.  The beta is consistently above 0, indicating some correlation with overall market movements.  However, high Maximum Drawdowns (MDDs) suggest periods of substantial risk.  A noteworthy trend is a rise in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the period.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK shows consistent revenue and high profit margins, suggesting financial stability. However, its significantly underperforming return compared to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  The negative long-term expected return (-183.2%) requires critical review. While short-term technical indicators suggest some upward momentum, the historical data shows substantial risk (high MDDs).  The inconsistent alpha and varying beta suggest that DUK's performance is not always closely tied to overall market movements.  Further investigation is needed into the methodology of the -183.2% expected return, and a thorough risk assessment should be conducted before any investment decisions.  Consideration should also be given to the relatively low ROE.
