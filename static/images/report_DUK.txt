**7. Overall Analysis:**

DUK has demonstrated consistent profitability and relatively stable financial performance. However, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While the company's fundamentals appear sound, the significantly negative long-term expected return prediction (which needs further clarification and validation) raises serious concerns.  The low beta indicates low correlation with the broader market, but this is not sufficient to compensate for the underperformance.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons for this underperformance and to determine the validity of the projected long-term return.  Investors should carefully assess the risk-reward profile before investing in DUK. The high maximum drawdowns observed in the past highlight the volatility of the stock.
