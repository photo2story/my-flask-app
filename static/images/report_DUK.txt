## Duke Energy Corp (DUK) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Duke Energy Corp (DUK), a major U.S. electric power holding company.  We will examine its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key indicators, earnings, and financial information.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500:**

DUK's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

**6) Overall Analysis:**

DUK shows strong relative performance against the S&P 500, supported by consistent positive alpha and favorable technical indicators. While recent earnings show some variability, the company maintains high profit margins and strong revenue.  The medium risk assessment from the MRI and the fluctuation in recent earnings suggest a need for caution. The projected 7.5% expected return over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, exceeding the anticipated S&P 500 return,  presents a potentially attractive opportunity, but further in-depth due diligence is recommended before any investment decision.  Remember, past performance is not a guarantee of future results.
