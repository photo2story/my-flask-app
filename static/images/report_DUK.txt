**1. Return Rate Comparison (DUK vs. S&P 500):**

*   **Company Overview:** Duke Energy Corp is a diversified energy company providing electricity and natural gas to customers in the Southeast and Midwest.
*   **Divergence:** DUK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 with a divergence of -60.1%. Its relative divergence is 4.7, meaning it's currently near the lower end of its historical divergence range compared to the S&P 500. This suggests there's significant potential for mean reversion if DUK's performance improves relative to the broader market.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    *   The data shows periods of both positive and negative Alpha, indicating DUK's performance has sometimes exceeded and sometimes lagged its expected return based on its Beta.
    *   Beta values are generally low (around 0.0-0.5), suggesting that DUK stock price is less sensitive than market fluctuations and less volatile than the market.
    *   CAGR has varied significantly over the years, with a negative CAGR recently in 2022-2025.
    *   The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, indicating the risk of significant losses during downturns.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This indicates a short-term downtrend.
*   The "Last-market" data indicates a small increase in price, but it is not enough to change the overall downtrend.

**3. Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.7 suggests a "Medium Investment Recommended" rating, indicating a moderate level of risk based on the model.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 29.79 indicates an oversold condition. This can suggest a potential for a rebound in price.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.11 is close to 0, which means that the short-term and long-term moving averages are relatively close to each other and DUK prices may not have a clear trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying the stock with caution, with a small allocation of capital (8 shares) based on the oversold condition and the MRI.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** An increase of 4.5 in the recent divergence suggests a short-term uptrend.
*   **Expected Return:** A very low expected return of -180.5% is a strong negative signal, warning against long-term investment at the current level.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

The recent news is mixed:

*   **Positive:** Scotiabank issued a positive forecast for the stock price.
*   **Negative:** UBS lowered the price target. Duke Energy is being viewed as "not attractive at current price levels," and the stock has underperformed the industry in the last 6 months.
*   **Neutral:** Duke Energy announced dividend payments.
*   **Valuation focus:** There is increasing scrutiny on Duke Energy's valuation amidst AI-driven outlooks for utilities in 2026.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   The overall analyst consensus is "Buy," with a mean rating of 2.18, indicating a generally positive outlook.
*   The average target price is significantly higher than the current price, suggesting potential upside.
*   However, the lack of specific recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the direction of analyst sentiment.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Duke Energy (DUK) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and faces challenges. The stock is currently in a short-term downtrend and is considered oversold based on the RSI. The MRI suggests a moderate level of risk, but the extremely negative expected return is a significant concern.

The news is mixed, with some analysts issuing positive forecasts while others are lowering price targets or deeming the stock unattractive at current levels. Overall, the analysis suggests caution. The stock is oversold and could experience a short-term rebound, but the long-term outlook is uncertain, and significant underperformance compared to the market raises concerns. The analyst consensus is "Buy," but the mixed news and negative expected return suggest that investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in DUK. The high MDD shows that you may face significant losses during downturns.
