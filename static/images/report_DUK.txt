**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK demonstrates strong relative performance against the S&P 500, with higher cumulative returns and a positive alpha in several periods.  However,  the recent price action shows some short-term bearish signals.  The financial statements reveal a healthy profit margin but relatively low ROE, suggesting potential opportunities for increased capital efficiency.  Further investigation into the causes of variations in EPS and ROE, along with a deeper analysis of the market environment, would be beneficial to refine the investment thesis. The 8.8% expected long-term outperformance is promising, but investors should carefully consider the risk profile and potential volatility before making investment decisions.  A more detailed analysis considering industry trends and macroeconomic factors would provide a more comprehensive perspective.
