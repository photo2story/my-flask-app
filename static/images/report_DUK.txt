**6. Overall Conclusion:**

DUK's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly, with a negative alpha and considerable MDD across different periods.  While the recent price action shows a short-term uptrend, the negative expected return versus the S&P 500 and some inconsistency in earnings raise concerns.  The relatively stable revenue and healthy profit margins suggest a fundamentally sound business, but  a deeper dive into the financial statements, considering factors like debt levels and future regulatory changes, is needed.  Further analysis is required to validate the -64.1% long-term expected return and the overall investment thesis. The current data suggests caution.
