## Duke Energy Corp (DUK) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

DUK's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO).  While DUK shows positive growth, its underperformance relative to the broader market needs further investigation.  The provided data suggests a need to delve into the company's fundamentals and market positioning to understand the reasons behind this underperformance.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Duke Energy Corp (DUK) is a U.S. electric power holding company that provides electricity to 7.8 million customers in six states.

* **DUK Cumulative Return:** 61.39%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 91.19%
* **Return Difference:** -29.8%
* **Relative Divergence:** 34.6% (This means DUK's underperformance is relatively in the lower 34.6% of the historical divergence range.)

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed results. While CAGR increased over time, Alpha generally remains low, indicating limited outperformance compared to the market benchmark.  Beta suggests moderate market sensitivity, generally between 0.3 and 0.4.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values across several periods highlight significant risk associated with DUK.  Market capitalization steadily increased during the observed period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Last Market Price:** $121.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $117.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $117.98
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $113.03

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent price stability, though the price is significantly higher than the 60 day moving average suggesting recent positive momentum.  The last market price shows a recent increase of $1.63, indicating a potential short-term upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -22.2% (Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 projected over the long term)

The recent price increase ('change' in `Last-market`) suggests a potential short-term positive trend, potentially counteracting the bearish signals from the PPO and negative expected return.  However, the negative long-term expected return is a significant concern.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK shows consistent profitability with high profit margins. However, its stock performance significantly underperforms the S&P 500, particularly in the long term. The negative expected return (-22.2%) relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern. While recent price movement shows some positive signs, the inconsistent earnings and relatively low ROE raise questions about its future growth potential. Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying reasons for DUK's underperformance compared to the market, including a detailed sector comparison and analysis of the company's competitive landscape and long-term strategic initiatives.  The high MDD also highlights the need for a thorough risk assessment before any investment decision.
