## Duke Energy Corp (DUK) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Duke Energy Corp (DUK) is an American electric power holding company that serves customers in six states in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States.

The cumulative return of DUK (56.68%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's cumulative return (119.94%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -63.3%, placing it in the 7.1st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided minimum and maximum historical differences). This suggests underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently sits around 0.1, indicating marginal outperformance relative to the market's beta, which is low.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies significantly from year to year, ranging from 6% to 25%.  While the average alpha is low, the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values show substantial risk, with several instances exceeding 10%, and peaking at -46%. This indicates potential for significant losses.  The consistently low beta around 0.1 suggests lower volatility than the overall market, yet combined with low returns this is not a positive attribute.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $110.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $110.75
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $108.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $110.58

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, and above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a recent slight downward trend.  The -0.62 price change from the previous close indicates a minor daily decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 61.06  - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral trend.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.52 - A positive value indicates upward momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +5.0 - Shows short-term upward momentum.

The large negative expected return of -392.1% is concerning and likely an error, considering its size.  This figure needs clarification and review.  It would not be possible to take this at face value in any meaningful interpretation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 1.62    | 1.7          | -0.08       |

Equity remains relatively stable.  ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates but remains consistently low, suggesting room for improvement in profitability relative to shareholder investment.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

DUK's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500, despite generally stable revenue and high profit margins. The consistently low beta indicates low market volatility, however, this is overshadowed by the poor returns relative to the benchmark index.  The high maximum drawdowns highlight considerable risk.  Recent earnings have been mixed, and while technical indicators show a slightly positive short-term outlook, the long-term underperformance is a major concern.  The extremely negative expected return value requires further investigation and clarification before any conclusions can be drawn.  A thorough review of the -392.1% expected return value is necessary before any investment decision can be made. This figure must be corrected, and the methodology underpinning this calculation should be scrutinized.  Without a correction, the overall conclusion would remain decisively bearish.
