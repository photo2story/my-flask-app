*   **Beta:** Beta is low (generally under 0.5), suggesting the stock is less volatile than the overall market.

**3) Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) – This suggests the model views DUK as relatively safe *despite* the other negative indicators.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 39.89 (Approaching oversold territory, but not quite there).
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.14 (Slightly negative, indicates a potential bearish momentum).

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -8.9 (Short-term decline in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return:** -615.0% (Highly negative, suggests significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term).

**Analysis:** The MRI and Hybrid Signal present a conflicting perspective compared to the expected return, RSI, PPO, and recent divergence. The MRI is high, suggesting safety, while the expected return is exceptionally poor. This suggests the model may be overweighting certain factors or that a rebound may be expected.

*   **Valuation Assessment:** Articles discuss DUK's valuation following recent YTD performance.

**Analysis:** The news paints a mixed picture. The underperformance headline is negative. The energy storage news is potentially positive, suggesting investment in future growth. The institutional investment provides some confidence.

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a positive outlook on the stock, suggesting a potential price increase.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **The Dilemma:** DUK is underperforming the S&P 500 significantly. The "High Investment Recommended" MRI rating seems at odds with the negative expected return and recent underperformance.
*   **Mixed Signals:** While the stock is below key moving averages, the RSI is approaching oversold, and analysts have a "Buy" consensus with a target price higher than the current level.
*   **News Impact:** Recent news presents a mixed outlook. While some articles highlight underperformance, others focus on positive developments like energy storage investments and charitable initiatives.

**Overall:** DUK presents a complex picture. It's underperforming significantly, and the expected return is alarming. However, the MRI suggests safety, analysts are generally positive, and recent news is a mix of positive and negative. This may suggest the stock is a longer-term turnaround play or that the model has limitations in processing current circumstances. Potential investors should consider the conflicting signals and weigh their risk tolerance carefully, and perform deeper due diligence.
