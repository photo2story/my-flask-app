**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data is available, hindering a complete financial analysis. This lack of data is a significant limitation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While some periods showed positive alpha, the overall trend points to consistent underperformance.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture; the RSI suggests bearishness, while the PPO shows a weak bullish signal.  Recent earnings have been somewhat inconsistent relative to expectations. The critical missing financial data (revenue, gross profit) severely limits a comprehensive evaluation. The provided -488.4% expected return is highly problematic and requires clarification or correction.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for DUK's underperformance and a thorough review of the methodology for calculating expected return are necessary before drawing conclusive recommendations.
