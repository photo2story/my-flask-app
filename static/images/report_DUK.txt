### 7. 종합적으로 분석

**Summary:**

Duke Energy (DUK) presents a mixed investment picture:

*   **Negative Aspects:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, very negative expected return, and sector underperformance.
*   **Positive Aspects:** Recent positive earnings surprises, analyst "Buy" consensus, positive (but weakening) short-term price momentum, and a medium risk profile according to the MRI.

**Recommendation:**

Given the substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the very negative expected return, a **cautious approach is warranted**.  While analyst ratings are positive and short-term price momentum is present, the long-term outlook appears weak based on the data provided. Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before investing in DUK, considering the significant underperformance compared to the broader market. Consider further research to understand the drivers of the negative expected return and whether the company has plans to address this issue.
