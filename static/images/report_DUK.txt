**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the period analyzed. While its financial statements show relatively strong and stable revenue and profit margins, the negative alpha and inconsistent earnings performance raise concerns.  The -85.1% expected return (requiring further validation) highlights a substantial projected underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term.  Further investigation into the reasons for underperformance, including sector-specific factors and competitive landscape, is necessary before forming a conclusive opinion.  The provided data suggest a cautious approach to investment in DUK.  More detailed analysis, considering macroeconomic factors and industry trends, is needed for a thorough investment decision.  The extremely negative long-term expected return is a significant red flag and warrants careful scrutiny.
