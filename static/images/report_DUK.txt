* **20-Day Moving Average:** $113.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $111.00

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent upward momentum.  The price is also above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.58 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.0018 (Slightly negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 12.6 (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** -129.9% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 requires further clarification.  The methodology used to calculate this figure should be reviewed for accuracy and context.  It is highly unlikely.)

The relatively low PPO value, despite the positive short-term relative divergence and recent slight price increase, points to the potential for a weakening price trend unless substantial upward momentum resumes.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 in recent years, as evidenced by the large difference in cumulative returns and the negative expected return (which needs further investigation due to its extreme value).  While the company exhibits strong profitability and stable revenue, the relatively low PPO and variable earnings performance raise some concerns.  The consistently high profit margins and stable equity are positive indicators, but the underperformance compared to the market suggests a need for caution.  Before investing, a thorough assessment of the reasons behind the underperformance,  a re-evaluation of the -129.9% expected return calculation, and consideration of the company's long-term growth prospects are crucial.  The relatively high beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  A long-term investment strategy might be considered only after addressing the concerns outlined above.
