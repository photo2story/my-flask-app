* **20-day Moving Average:** $119.31
* **60-day Moving Average:** $114.49

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support. The recent price change of -$4.13 (-3.33%) shows a notable drop from the previous closing price.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk category) suggests caution.
* **RSI:** 45.86 (below 50) indicates bearish momentum, but not oversold.
* **PPO:** 0.0037 (near zero) signals weak momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +21.7% suggests recent short-term upward pressure.
* **Expected Return:** -6.5%  This is a short-term expectation; given the long-term outlook and the slightly higher historical performance against the S&P 500,  long-term (2+ years) accumulation could yield a positive return *relative to* the S&P 500, although this cannot be guaranteed.  The -6.5% figure needs further clarification of its calculation method.

The significant price drop (-$4.13) warrants further investigation into potential underlying news or market events impacting DUK's stock price.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK shows a slight outperformance against the S&P 500 historically, but recent performance has been weaker.  The high MRI suggests a high-risk profile. While some positive indicators exist (e.g., improving equity), the recent price drop and mixed earnings reports warrant caution.  Further research is necessary to determine the reasons for the recent price decline and the long-term viability of DUK as an investment, particularly considering the need to better understand the provided -6.5% expected return. A deeper dive into news affecting the company and the broader energy sector is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The provided data suggests a need for continued monitoring and a more in-depth fundamental and technical analysis.
