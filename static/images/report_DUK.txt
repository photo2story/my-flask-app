This report analyzes Duke Energy Corp (DUK), a major energy holding company operating in the United States, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

DUK's cumulative return (52.61%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (121.78%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -69.2%, indicating substantial underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  This places DUK at the lowest percentile (0.0) in the historical range of relative performance against the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR data shows consistent, but below-market, growth from 2015-2024.  Alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting slight outperformance but with high beta (around 0.1), indicating high market sensitivity.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

DUK's closing price is $107.44.  The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day ($109.22), 20-day ($113.16), and 60-day ($113.75) moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (22.73):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.65):**  Shows a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:**  A recent 20-day decline of -2.8% further confirms the short-term downtrend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided data indicates no expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This likely reflects the historical underperformance already observed.  Given the current price is below moving averages and RSI is low, a short-term rebound could be possible, but long-term outperformance is not suggested by this data.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The latest quarterly earnings show some variability. While some quarters beat EPS expectations (2024-08-06, 2024-05-07, 2023-11-02), others missed (2024-11-07, 2024-02-08). There's no clear upward or downward trend in EPS over the reported periods.  A deeper dive into revenue figures would provide further insight.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates slightly quarter-to-quarter, with no clear upward trend visible in this short timeframe.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins remain relatively stable, around 49%, indicating consistent profitability.
* **Equity:** Equity is relatively stable, suggesting a sound financial position.
* **ROE:** ROE is modest and shows fluctuation, but it doesn't demonstrate substantial consistent growth.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information on recent earnings news within the past two days, market outlook, or analyst opinions was provided.  This significantly limits the analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DUK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While the recent RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce due to being oversold, the persistent underperformance, negative PPO, and below-average moving averages indicate a bearish short-term outlook.  The inconsistent earnings and stable but not growing ROE provide limited confidence in sustained long-term outperformance against the broader market, supporting the provided expected return of 0%.  Additional information on recent news, analyst ratings, and revenue growth trends is crucial for a more complete assessment.  The lack of such information in this analysis necessitates considerable caution.
