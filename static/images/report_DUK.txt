**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

DUK's cumulative return is 55.60%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 122.16%. The difference is -66.6%, placing it at the 3.2nd percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 (based on the provided minimum and maximum divergences).  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting marginal outperformance relative to the market's beta.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $109.86
* **5-day moving average:** $109.61
* **20-day moving average:** $108.025
* **60-day moving average:** $110.7115

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term downtrend.  The recent price increase of $0.48 (from previous close) does not show significant upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.10 –  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions, suggesting neutral momentum.
* **PPO:** 0.46 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -5.7% –  Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** -918.7% – This extremely negative expected return is alarming and needs further investigation.  It's crucial to understand the methodology and assumptions behind this calculation.  The extremely low value likely reflects the historical underperformance already described.  Long-term (2+ years) investment with regular contributions is a strategy which mitigates against extreme short-term volatility.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DUK's strong financial fundamentals, reflected in stable revenue and high profit margins, are at odds with its significant underperformance against the S&P 500.  The negative expected return is a serious concern and requires clarification of the calculation method.  While some short-term positive momentum exists, the longer-term trend is bearish.  Investors should carefully consider the reasons for the persistent underperformance relative to the market before making any investment decisions.  The relatively stable financial fundamentals may still hold appeal for more risk-averse investors.  Further research into the -918.7% expected return is needed to assess the validity and implications of this prediction.
