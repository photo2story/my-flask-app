This report analyzes Duke Energy Corp (DUK), a major US electric power holding company, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

DUK's cumulative return (51.58%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (115.96%) over the analyzed period.  The provided data shows a considerable lag of -64.4%, placing it in the 7.4th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $107.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $108.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $109.85
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $113.23

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (32.00):** Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (0.0053):**  Near zero, suggesting a potential neutral or slightly bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+0.1):** Suggests a minor recent upward trend, although it might be a temporary rebound.
* **Expected Return (-365.3%):** This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term raises significant concerns.  This projection should be viewed with extreme caution, as such a dramatic negative return is highly unlikely unless unexpected major adverse events occur.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data shows mixed results:

* **Quarterly EPS:** Fluctuation between $1.18 and $1.94, lacking a clear consistent trend.
* **EPS vs. Expectations:** Some quarters beat expectations (e.g., 2024-08-06, 2023-11-02), while others missed (e.g., 2024-02-08, 2024-05-07).  The variance between actual and expected EPS is not consistently large.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue shows some fluctuation but doesn't demonstrate a strong consistent growth trend.
* **Profit Margin:**  Profit margins are relatively stable, hovering around 49%, indicating consistent profitability.
* **Equity:** Equity remains relatively stable around $49 Billion.
* **ROE:** Return on Equity fluctuates, suggesting some variability in profitability, though generally remaining above 2%.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **No recent earnings news (within the last 2 days) was provided.** To provide a comprehensive analysis, recent news articles and press releases from Duke Energy, covering market outlook and analyst opinions, would be necessary.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

DUK's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500. While the company demonstrates consistent profitability (stable profit margins), revenue growth appears inconsistent, and the price is currently below its moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The provided extremely negative long-term expected return is concerning and requires further investigation to understand the underlying assumptions. The mixed EPS results don't show a clear upward or downward trend.  The RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, which could present an opportunity for a short-term bounce, but the overall long-term outlook based on the provided data is negative relative to the S&P 500.  More information, particularly on recent news and analyst opinions, is crucial for a complete assessment.

**8.  Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the limited data provided. It does not constitute financial advice.  Independent research and consultation with a financial advisor are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The extremely negative projected return needs further clarification and investigation into its basis before any investment conclusion should be made.
