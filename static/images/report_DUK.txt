*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** DUK's CAGR has fluctuated significantly. It was positive in the earlier periods but has recently turned negative.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD is consistently high, indicating substantial potential losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the stock's performance relative to a benchmark. Negative alpha values suggest underperformance. Alpha has been particularly negative in recent periods, indicating that DUK has significantly underperformed its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A Beta close to 0.0 indicates that the stock's price is less sensitive to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** This likely refers to Market Capitalization in Billions. Duke Energy is a large-cap company.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Analysis:** The current price ($115.56) is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This *could* indicate a short-term downward trend, especially since the 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and both are below the 60-day SMA. The slight increase in the last market price to $116.3 is too short to be significant.

**3. Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** A value of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk, indicating the investment is relatively safe.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 34.28 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), *potentially* suggesting a possible rebound.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.10 suggests some positive momentum, but it's not very strong.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends a 90% buy with cash, labeled "Safe".
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** A positive change (0.1) indicates a short-term upward trend in relative divergence.
*   **Expected Return:** A negative expected return of -246% is *highly* concerning, suggesting the model anticipates significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. This should raise concerns.
