### 7. 종합 분석 (Overall Analysis)

DUK has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, with a negative expected return over the long term. While earnings have generally met expectations and profit margins remain high, recent news suggests potential volatility and regulatory changes. The company's low beta and Market Risk Indicator suggest a relatively low-risk profile, but the negative alpha and the increased MDD in the most recent period (2023-2025) raise concerns about recent performance. The recent short-term uptick in relative divergence provides a glimmer of hope, but a cautious approach is warranted.
