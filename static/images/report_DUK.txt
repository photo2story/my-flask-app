**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Fluctuated considerably, with positive returns in earlier periods, but recently showing negative CAGR (-14.0%) for the last two periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD values consistently across all periods indicate significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha, representing excess return relative to the market, is highly variable. Recent periods show significantly negative Alpha, indicating DUK is heavily underperforming its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta is consistently low, between 0 and 0.5, suggesting that DUK stock is less sensitive to market movements than the overall market. This is typical for a utility company.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization increased over the first six periods, but has fallen for the last three periods.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 117.18
*   **Previous Close:** 117.48
*   **Change:** -0.26
*   **5-day SMA:** 116.66
*   **20-day SMA:** 117.04
*   **60-day SMA:** 122.33

**Analysis:** The stock is currently trading below its 60-day SMA, suggesting a recent downward trend. The 5-day SMA is slightly below the 20-day SMA, indicating further potential short-term weakness. The recent change from the previous close is relatively small, suggesting no significant price shock.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 52.62
*   **PPO:** 0.32
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 90% (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 0.1 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -246.0% (Long-term, >2 years)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a high level of investment recommendation.
*   The RSI is around 50, indicating neutral momentum.
*   The PPO is slightly positive, suggesting a potential uptrend but not a strong one.
*   The hybrid signal suggests a 90% buy.
*   The recent divergence change indicates a slight short-term positive change relative to the comparison stock (VOO).
*   However, the **very negative expected return** of -246% is extremely concerning and contradictory to the MRI indication. This suggests either a major flaw in the expected return calculation or a significantly negative outlook for the stock despite its MRI.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   Several articles highlight underperformance compared to the industry.
*   NovaPoint Capital LLC purchased shares, indicating some institutional confidence.
*   News discusses nuclear bets, rate hikes, dividends, and the 2026 outlook, suggesting potential future catalysts.
*   A dividend announcement reinforces the utility nature of the stock.
*   One article notes the stock dropped despite market gains, consistent with the divergence seen in the return rate data.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean = 2.18)
*   **Target Price:** 135.76 (Avg) / 150.00 (High) / 121.00 (Low)
*   **Rating Changes:** No recent changes listed.

**Analysis:**  Analysts generally have a "Buy" rating on the stock, with an average target price significantly higher than the current price, suggesting potential upside.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Duke Energy (DUK) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, with a large negative divergence. While analysts have a "Buy" consensus and a higher target price, the financial data presents a mixed picture. The recent news highlights underperformance, but also points to potential future catalysts like nuclear investments and rate hikes.

The concerning aspects are:

*   **Significant Underperformance:** DUK has considerably lagged the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The expected return of -246% contradicts the MRI indication and raises serious questions about the long-term investment outlook.
*   **Inconsistent Indications:** While there is some positive sentiment on the price target and analyst consensus (buy rating), other indicators cast doubt on its investment viability.

**Conclusion:**

The analysis suggests caution regarding investing in Duke Energy. While analysts are generally positive, the underperformance, negative expected return, and contradictory signals warrant further investigation. I recommend further research to understand the factors contributing to the negative expected return and the discrepancy with the analyst ratings and MRI. Any investment decision should be made with a clear understanding of these risks and a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and future prospects. The negative expected return is a HUGE red flag.
