### 7. Summary and Conclusion

Recent financial data indicate stable revenue and profit margins, with a gradual increase in equity. However, the negative expected return and recent news highlighting volatility and potential shifts in market sentiment warrant caution.

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. The MRI indicates low risk, while the RSI is neutral. However, the negative PPO and significantly negative expected return suggest potential downside risks.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals and potential for volatility, investors should closely monitor DUK's performance and recent news. The Hybrid Signal suggests a gradual buying approach ("Buy 80% of cash"), which aligns with a cautious investment strategy. The negative expected return highlights the importance of careful consideration before making any substantial investments.
