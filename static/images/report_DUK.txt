**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Duke Energy Corp (DUK) is a U.S.-based electric power holding company.  Over the analyzed period, DUK significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a 9.95% higher cumulative return.  While the relative divergence of 49% suggests a relatively strong performance compared to its historical track record against VOO, it's crucial to remember that this is relative and not an absolute measure of outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a generally positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and a low beta (lower volatility than the market) across the observed periods.  However, the recent period (2023-2025) shows a decline in both CAGR and Alpha, suggesting a potential slowdown in growth and market-beating performance.  The consistently low beta suggests DUK is a relatively stable investment.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $121.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $120.86
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $118.48

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential longer-term uptrend.  The recent small price increase is not significant enough to suggest a dramatic upswing.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 15.1% (Superior to S&P 500)

The technical indicators paint a somewhat mixed picture.  While the RSI is nearing oversold levels, the negative PPO and negative relative divergence suggest bearish momentum in the short term.  However, the expected return remains positive and significantly exceeds the S&P 500, suggesting long-term potential.
