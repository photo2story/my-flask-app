## Duke Energy Corp (DUK) Stock Report

This report analyzes Duke Energy Corp (DUK), a U.S. electric power holding company, based on provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

DUK's cumulative return (100.03%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) at 82.57%, resulting in a 17.5% difference.  The relative divergence of 59.6% indicates DUK's performance is in the upper range compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and a relatively low beta (lower volatility than the market) over the past several years, especially from 2018 onwards.  However, the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has declined recently indicating a slowing growth trend.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) also suggests periods of significant price decline, although it has generally remained within a manageable range.

**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was available.  This significantly limits a complete financial analysis.  Further data is needed.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK shows strong long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500, supported by positive alpha and low beta.  However, recent price action and some technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction.  Earnings have generally been positive, but require more detailed analysis.  The lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) prevents a thorough financial assessment.  A long-term (2+ years) investment in DUK could offer a potentially superior return compared to the S&P 500, but short-term volatility should be anticipated.  Further investigation into the November 2024 earnings miss and obtaining comprehensive financial data is crucial for a more robust assessment.
