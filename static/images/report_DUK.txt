*   **Alpha:** The Alpha fluctuates significantly, indicating periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. Notably, the recent years (2022-2025) show significantly negative alpha, suggesting substantial underperformance.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are relatively low (generally below 0.5), suggesting that DUK's price is less volatile than the overall market.
*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) has deteriorated in recent periods, with negative growth observed in the last two periods.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant potential for loss.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   The 5-day SMA is slightly below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a potential short-term downtrend.
*   The recent price decrease (price': 117.18, 'previousClose': 117.48, 'change': -0.26) is small, but confirms the downtrend.

*   **RSI:** An RSI of 52.62 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.32 suggests a minor bullish trend, as the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends allocating 90% of cash to buy shares, suggesting a positive short-term outlook according to that indicator.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The positive change in recent divergence suggests a short-term upward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The very negative expected return of -246% is a major red flag, suggesting the model expects significant underperformance in the long term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Multiple articles highlight DUK's underperformance relative to its industry.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** The analyst consensus is "Buy" with a mean rating of 2.18. This suggests a generally positive outlook from analysts.
*   **Target Price:** The average target price is $135.76, representing a potential upside from the current price of $117.18.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent rating changes were provided, but this information would be helpful in assessing the current sentiment of analysts.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Duke Energy (DUK) is currently facing a mixed outlook. While analysts have a "Buy" consensus and the MRI suggests a low risk investment, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the hybrid signal and PPO suggest a minor bullish trend. The news articles reflect this with headlines indicating underperformance in the industry.

The technical indicators present a conflicting picture. The RSI is neutral, the positive change in recent divergence suggests a short-term upward trend, but the large negative value for the "Expected Return" (at -246%) should be a major point of concern.

**In conclusion, caution is warranted.** While analysts have a positive view and the market risk is low, the actual return and recent news about underperformance suggest to make more research before investing. The negative Expected Return, if accurate, should cause investors to carefully consider if this investment is suitable for their portfolio. The relatively low Beta suggests the stock is less volatile than the market, which may appeal to risk-averse investors, but it also implies limited upside potential.
