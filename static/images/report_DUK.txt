## Duke Energy Corp (DUK) Investment Review

This report analyzes Duke Energy Corp (DUK), a US-based electric power holding company, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

DUK's cumulative return (54.47%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (116.43%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -62.0%, placing it at the 8.6th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (where a higher percentile indicates better relative performance).  The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting minimal outperformance relative to the market (as measured by beta, which is consistently around 0.84, indicating lower volatility than the S&P500).  The company's CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) also fluctuated, but remained generally below the implied S&P 500 CAGR during the relevant periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $109.06
* **5-day Moving Average:** $106.87
* **20-day Moving Average:** $107.50
* **60-day Moving Average:** $111.43

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend, but a longer-term downtrend relative to the recent past.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.41 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.23 (Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum, though weak)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.2 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -313.2% This extremely negative figure suggests a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years) based on current data.  Further analysis is needed to justify such a drastic prediction.  It is extremely unlikely that a large cap stock would underperform to such an extent.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DUK's financial performance is relatively stable, with consistent revenue and high profit margins. However, its stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some short-term technical indicators suggest a potential upward trend, the long-term outlook, based on the provided -313.2% expected return, raises serious concerns.  This extremely negative prediction requires further investigation and independent verification as it is highly improbable. The low alpha values and relatively low and inconsistent ROE further support the conclusion of underperformance relative to the market.  A more thorough fundamental analysis, considering factors beyond the scope of this report, is necessary before making any investment decisions.

**8. Disclaimer:** This report is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice.  The data used is limited, and further analysis is needed for a comprehensive investment decision.  The -313.2% expected return figure warrants critical examination and external validation.
