**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $117.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $116.58
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $113.95
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $110.17

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The last market data shows a slight increase ($0.35) from the previous close.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 61.24 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.22 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +5.8% (Short-term upward momentum)

The RSI and PPO suggest a moderately bullish sentiment. The positive relative strength change reinforces the short-term uptrend.  The provided `Expected Return` of -91.1% is highly unusual and requires clarification; this value needs verification. A negative expected return contradicts the positive technical indicators and needs further context.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the given period. While recent price action and some technical indicators suggest a short-term bullish trend, the consistently negative alpha, mixed earnings results, and the highly questionable -91.1% expected return raise significant concerns. The relatively high and stable profit margins and reasonable equity position offer some stability, but further investigation into the provided Alpha and Expected Return is crucial before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The long-term outlook should incorporate detailed risk assessment, taking into account the underperformance relative to the broader market and the company's specific industry risks.  The provided data lacks sufficient information for a conclusive long-term recommendation.
