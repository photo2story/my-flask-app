**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

DUK's cumulative return (52.78%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (117.56%) over the analyzed period.  The provided data shows a difference of -64.8%, placing it at the 6.7th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates considerable underperformance compared to the broader market. The alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting minimal outperformance relative to the market (beta) after adjusting for market risk.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** 113.74

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible short-term downtrend.  The last market price of 108.97 does not indicate a significant jump or fall; the difference from the closing price is marginal.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** -0.2942 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength (20-day):**  Positive change of 6.7%, indicating a recent short-term upswing.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates that no significant S&P 500 alpha is predicted over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.)
