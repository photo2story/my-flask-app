**5) Comprehensive Analysis & Summary**

Duke Energy (DUK) is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly, as evidenced by the negative divergence in cumulative returns and negative Alpha in recent periods. While the company is attempting to position itself to benefit from the increasing power demands of AI, particularly through nuclear energy investments, recent news articles and analyst opinions paint a mixed picture. Some analysts consider the stock unattractive at current price levels, while others highlight the potential upside from AI-driven power demand. The negative expected return is very concerning and warrants careful consideration.

**In Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, a conservative approach to DUK seems warranted. The negative expected return should be a major red flag. While the long-term potential related to AI and nuclear energy is interesting, the current indicators and news sentiment suggest caution.
