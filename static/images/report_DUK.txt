However,  the relatively high maximum drawdowns seen in the historical alpha/beta data highlight potential for volatility. Investors should carefully consider the risk tolerance before investing in DUK.  Further in-depth research into the company's specific business strategy and future outlook is advised before making any investment decisions.
