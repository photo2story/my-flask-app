*   **5-day Moving Average:** 126.15

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 61.95  (Approaching overbought territory)

*   **Recent Price Action:** {'price': 126.09, 'previousClose': 127.02, 'change': -0.73}. The negative change suggests a slight downward pressure but is not significant enough to indicate a major event on its own.

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium-risk investment, and the hybrid signal recommends a full buy.
*   The positive change in relative difference indicates that DUK is starting to outperform the S&P 500 over the short term, but still significantly underperforms over the long term (-67.8%).
*   The negative Expected Return is a *major* red flag, indicating that, based on this data, long-term investment in DUK is projected to *underperform* the S&P 500 significantly.

If the investor is determined to invest in DUK, it could be a reasonable choice for a short-term investment to take advantage of an increase in the price due to a short-term upswing.
