**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Duke Energy Corp (DUK) is an American electric power holding company that operates primarily in the eastern United States.  As of the last data point, DUK's cumulative return (51.34%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (112.74%), resulting in a difference of -61.4%. This places it at the 9.3rd percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, indicating consistent underperformance.

The beta, while fluctuating slightly, generally remains around 0.5, implying lower volatility than the overall market.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows varied performance over the years, with some periods exhibiting strong growth but others lagging.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

The technical indicators offer some mildly positive signals, but are not conclusive. Further investigation into the methodology behind the -285.8% expected return is absolutely crucial before drawing any investment conclusions.  Before considering any investment in DUK, a thorough analysis of the company's future prospects, competitive landscape, and the aforementioned negative expected return is vital.  The data presented suggest a need for caution.
