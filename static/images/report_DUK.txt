## Duke Energy Corp (DUK) Investment Review

This report analyzes Duke Energy Corp (DUK), a US-based electric power holding company that operates primarily in the eastern United States.  The analysis incorporates provided financial data, performance metrics, and market indicators.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

DUK's cumulative return of 70.17% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's return of 128.86%. The difference is -58.7%, placing it at the 14.1th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided relative divergence metric).  This suggests underperformance compared to the broader market.  The alpha consistently above 1 indicates outperformance relative to the market but the cumulative return indicates otherwise. This discrepancy warrants further investigation.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a generally consistent beta around 1.1-1.3, indicating a correlation with the market. Alpha, however, fluctuates, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the benchmark. The CAGR is relatively low considering the market's gains. The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) also presents some significant risks over time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Close Price:** $117.42
* **5-day MA:** $115.8
* **20-day MA:** $112.96
* **60-day MA:** $114.46

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, the relatively small difference between the close price and the moving averages implies limited momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (78.95):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (0.59):**  A positive value suggests bullish momentum, but it is necessary to analyze the trend of the PPO to gain further insights.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-0.3):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided expected return suggests no significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is anticipated over the long term (2+ years).  This is consistent with the past performance analysis.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data shows some variability:

* **2024-11-07:** EPS slightly missed expectations (1.62 vs 1.7).
* **2024-08-06:** EPS beat expectations (1.18 vs 1.02).
* **2024-05-07:** EPS beat expectations (1.44 vs 1.38).
* **2024-02-08:** EPS slightly missed expectations (1.51 vs 1.54).
* **2023-11-02:** EPS slightly beat expectations (1.94 vs 1.92).

The data doesn't provide a clear trend in EPS growth.  There is a mix of beats and misses against expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates across the quarters, but doesn't demonstrate a consistent upward trend.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margin is consistently high, ranging from 47.73% to 49.44%, showcasing strong profitability.
* **Equity:** Equity remains relatively stable.
* **ROE:** ROE fluctuates, but generally remains in the low single digits, suggesting a reasonable, but not exceptional return on equity.

The consistency in profit margins is a positive sign of the company's operational efficiency.  The lack of significant revenue growth may explain the lower than expected total returns.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

(This section requires additional information.  No recent news or market outlook data is included in the provided text.)


**7. Overall Analysis:**

DUK shows strong profitability and consistent profit margins, which are positive indicators. However, its performance significantly lags the S&P 500, raising concerns. The recent price action shows some upward momentum, but the overbought RSI suggests potential for a pullback. The mixed earnings results and lack of clear revenue growth trends indicate that future performance might not dramatically outperform the market. Given the lack of recent news and the provided expected return, a long-term investment in DUK might not substantially outpace the S&P 500.  Further research into the reasons for its underperformance relative to the market is warranted.
