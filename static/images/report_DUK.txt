**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $115.55
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $112.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $113.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $110.98

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent upward momentum.  However, it remains above the 60-day average, indicating a potential sustained upward trend.  The recent price increase (Last-market data shows a positive change) is notable.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.66 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.12 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +6.7 (Positive change points to recent short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -148.7% (This extremely negative value for long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further investigation. It may reflect a flawed model or a specific scenario with high uncertainty)

The relatively small price increase, while positive, doesn't alone suggest a significant trend reversal. The negative PPO and the extremely negative long-term expected return, however, are red flags that warrant further scrutiny.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent price movement shows some positive momentum, the negative PPO, the extremely negative long-term expected return, and the mixed earnings results raise concerns. The consistent high profit margins and stable equity are positive factors.  However, the substantial underperformance relative to the market and the concerning -148.7% long term expected return requires further investigation to understand the reasons behind this prediction before making any investment decision.  A thorough review of the methodology used to calculate the expected return and a deeper dive into the company's specific circumstances and future outlook are strongly recommended.
