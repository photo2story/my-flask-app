Duke Energy Corp (DUK) is a U.S. electric power company that operates in several states.  Over the period analyzed, DUK's cumulative return (55.66%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (122.07%).

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (34.39):**  Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.46):** Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-3.9):** Shows a recent downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided expected return of 0% implies that, based on the provided data, no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated with long-term (2+ years) investing.  This should be interpreted cautiously, as expected returns are complex to model and are sensitive to many factors not included in the provided data.  A 0% projection simply means the model does not predict outperformance.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions are provided in the initial data.  Information from the past two days regarding earnings announcements is missing from the given data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

DUK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While the stock is currently in oversold territory (RSI),  negative momentum indicators (PPO) and a downward trending relative strength suggest caution. Recent earnings have been mixed, with no clear upward trend in EPS or revenue.  Profit margins remain high, indicative of a stable, profitable business.  However, the lack of recent news, a 0% expected return projection, and underperformance versus the market suggest that further analysis is needed before making an investment decision.  More information on revenue growth trends and analyst opinions would strengthen the analysis and better inform investment choices.
