This report analyzes Duke Energy Corp (DUK), a US-based electric power holding company that engages in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

DUK's cumulative return of 66.66% lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 128.31% over the analyzed period.  The difference is -61.65%, placing it in the 10.41st percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (min: -70.16%, max: 11.61%).  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market. The provided alpha and beta analysis shows varying performance compared to the market benchmark (S&P500) across different time periods, with alpha fluctuating and beta generally above 0.4, indicating some level of market sensitivity, but not a direct, linear correlation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $115.0
* **5-day Moving Average:** $114.38
* **20-day Moving Average:** $112.55
* **60-day Moving Average:** $114.40

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting mild upward momentum, but still below the 20 day moving average indicating a recent period of price decline.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (57.5):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum.
* **PPO (0.4):**  A positive value suggests bullish momentum, but the value is low, suggesting this momentum is relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-8.92%):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength compared to the benchmark, further confirming weaker momentum.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return suggests no significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is anticipated over the long term (2+ years).  This should be treated with caution, as the model might not account for all influencing factors.  The closing price of $114.99 is relatively close to the moving averages, and the lack of significant price changes does not indicate any evidence of a recent sharp upward or downward movement.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS data shows mixed results compared to expectations. While some quarters exceeded expectations (e.g., 2024-11-07, 2024-05-07, 2023-11-02), others fell slightly short (e.g., 2024-08-06, 2024-02-08).  The most recent EPS (1.62) is slightly below the expected EPS (1.7).  Overall, the results appear fairly consistent and do not present drastic surprises.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The provided financial statements show consistent Revenue and Profit Margin across quarters, indicating relatively stable profitability.  Equity has remained quite stable, with the Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuating around 2%, signifying reasonable returns on invested capital, though not exceptionally high. This signals stability but limited extraordinary growth.

**7. Summary:**

DUK has shown consistent profitability and relative stability in its financial performance. However, its returns have lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly over the given period. While recent price movements suggest mild upward momentum, technical indicators show neutral to slightly bearish signals.  The mixed EPS results against expectations and the low expected return do not give a strong bullish signal.  Further research into recent news and analyst opinions is essential to formulate a complete investment decision.


**8. Recommendations:**

Based on the data provided, DUK does not appear to be a strong candidate for outperformance compared to the broader market. Its consistent, yet unexceptional performance, combined with the lack of strong bullish signals, suggests a cautious approach. A long-term buy-and-hold strategy could be considered only if the investor's risk tolerance aligns with its inherent market sensitivity and slightly below-average historical growth, and after a thorough assessment of the company's future prospects based on the information gathered from recent news and financial reports.  A more thorough fundamental analysis is recommended before making any investment decision.
