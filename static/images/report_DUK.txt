DUK has shown consistent profitability and relatively stable revenue. However, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.

While the company's financials appear healthy, its future performance relative to the market remains uncertain.  A thorough review of the -488.4% expected return calculation is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high beta suggests higher volatility.  Further due diligence, considering macroeconomic factors and industry trends, is needed before formulating a definitive investment strategy.
