2026-01-01 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the Duke Energy (DUK) data you provided, followed by an analysis.

**1. Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Ticker:** DUK (Duke Energy Corp)
*   **Overview:** Duke Energy is a large utility company providing electricity and natural gas to customers in the Southeast and Midwest.
*   **DUK Cumulative Return:** 42.20%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -60.0
*   **Relative Divergence:** 4.8

**Analysis:**

*   DUK significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period.  The divergence of -60% shows a large gap in cumulative returns.
*   The relative divergence of 4.8 suggests that the current divergence is near the *lowest* end of its historical range (between the min and max of past divergence).
* It is unknown what time period the cumulative return and divergence are calculated over.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2024-2026  | 44.0% | 80.9% | -61.0% | 0.0 | 91.4 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The model predicts a 44% Compound Annual Growth Rate for Duke Energy from 2024-2026. This is a very high growth projection for a utility company.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown of 80.9% indicates a potentially large drop in value during this period.
*   **Alpha:** A negative Alpha of -61.0% means the stock is expected to underperform its benchmark index (likely the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of 0.0 suggests that DUK's price is theoretically uncorrelated with the broader market. This is highly unusual and questionable, as utilities generally have some market correlation.
*   **Cap:** A Cap of 91.4B (likely Market Cap in Billions)

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 117.68
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 117.50, Previous Close: 117.68, Change: -0.15
*   **5-day SMA:** 117.33
*   **20-day SMA:** 116.6097
*   **60-day SMA:** 122.164

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is currently below its 60-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) but above its 5-day and 20-day SMAs. This indicates a short-term uptrend but potential longer-term weakness.
*   The last market change is negative, indicating a slight downward pressure on the stock in the most recent trading.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 60.36 (approaching overbought territory, but not there yet)
*   **PPO:** 0.3764
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-19)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.0 (+)  (단기상승 - Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -190.7%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment Recommended" level of risk.
*   The RSI is around 60, indicating momentum, but not yet overbought.
*   The PPO value (0.3764) is positive, supporting the short-term uptrend indicated by the SMAs. The PPO measures the percentage difference between two moving averages, so a positive value means the shorter-term MA is above the longer-term MA.
*   The Hybrid Signal indicates a strong buy recommendation, suggesting a high degree of confidence in the stock's short-term potential.
*   The recent divergence change indicates a short-term upward trend relative to the S&P 500.
*   The **extremely negative Expected Return of -190.7% is highly concerning** and suggests the model anticipates significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. This sharply contrasts with the short-term "buy" signal.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Headlines:** Articles highlight underperformance vs. the industry, and news of shares being sold.
*   **Dividend Announcement:** Duke Energy announced dividend payments (positive).
*   **"Stable Growth" Articles:** Some articles discuss the regulated utility model driving stable growth (positive but potentially priced in).
*   **"Buying the Dip" Article:**  A Seeking Alpha article suggests buying the recent dip in DUK stock.
* There are a number of articles published on the same day (12/29/2025), this may indicate a regular reporting schedule.

**Analysis:**

*   The news presents a mixed picture. There are some positive points (dividend, stability), but negative headlines about underperformance and share sales are concerning. The "Buying the Dip" article suggests some see value in the stock at its current price.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.18)
*   **Opinions:** 17
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 135.76 / 150.00 / 121.00

**Analysis:**

*   Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating for Duke Energy.
*   The average target price of $135.76 suggests upside potential from the current price of around $117. The low target price of $121 also shows only a small degree of upside potential.
*   No recent rating changes were provided

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

Duke Energy presents a mixed investment picture.

*   **Negatives:** It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the model predicts continued underperformance. Recent news highlights underperformance and share sales. The -190.7% expected return is a major red flag. The high MDD (80.9%) suggests a potentially volatile next few years, while the 44% CAGR forecast should be taken with a grain of salt.
*   **Positives:** The stock shows a short-term uptrend based on SMAs and the 20-day relative divergence change. The MRI suggests medium investment risk. Analysts have a "Buy" rating with an average target price above the current price. The dividend announcement is positive. The regulated utility model provides stability.
*   **Contradictions:**  There is a conflict between the short-term positive indicators and the extremely negative long-term expected return and Alpha. The Beta of 0.0 is also questionable.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in Duke Energy at this time appears risky. While there are short-term positive signals and analyst optimism, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the negative long-term expected return, and some negative news headlines raise concerns. A high MDD and a high CAGR is unusual and may indicate low confidence in the overall analysis. Investors should carefully consider these factors and conduct further research before making a decision. It is important to understand why the model predicts such a negative expected return despite the "Buy" recommendation from analysts and the short-term positive trends.
