**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, a trend supported by a negative long-term expected return. While financial statements show generally stable revenue and strong profit margins, inconsistent earnings and moderate ROE raise concerns.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly positive short-term outlook, but the negative long-term expected return and persistent underperformance relative to the market warrant caution.  Further research into specific factors driving the underperformance (e.g., regulatory changes, industry headwinds) is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The relatively low Beta suggests lower risk than the market in theory, but this is offset by significantly negative alpha values in several periods.
