**In summary:** DUK appears to be facing short-term headwinds, but analysts and the company's strategic initiatives (SMRs) suggest potential long-term value. The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag that should be investigated further before making any investment decisions. The divergence between analyst ratings and model expectations is concerning. Investors should carefully weigh the short-term risks against the potential long-term rewards, considering the positive news alongside the negative technical and return indicators. It is also important to note there are no recent changes in analyst's ratings which is something to consider.
