DUK exhibits strong revenue and profitability, supported by solid financial fundamentals. However, its performance significantly lags behind the S&P 500, both cumulatively and in projected long-term returns. While short-term price action suggests potential upward momentum, the negative long-term expected return (-11.2%), mixed earnings, and inconsistent alpha suggest caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price surge and the drivers of the projected underperformance relative to the broader market is warranted before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment might be considered only after carefully assessing the company's long-term strategic direction and competitive landscape.
