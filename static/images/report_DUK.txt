**0) Introduction:**

This report analyzes Duke Energy Corp (DUK), a major US electric power holding company, based on provided financial data.  We will compare its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), examining key metrics to assess its investment potential.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

* **DUK Cumulative Return:** 68.17%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 66.69%
* **Return Difference:** 1.48% (DUK outperformed VOO by 1.48%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 58.8% (This indicates DUK's performance is in the higher range compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, not necessarily that it's 58.8% better).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows that DUK consistently exhibits a positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and a relatively low beta (lower volatility than the market) over the analyzed periods, although both fluctuate slightly from year to year.  The increasing CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) from 2015 to 2020 suggests accelerating growth, which then decreased in subsequent years. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows steady growth throughout the period.  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures highlight periods of significant risk, suggesting the need for careful risk management.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $117.73
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $118.98
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $115.64

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The recent price change of $1.4 indicates a positive movement.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk category based on the provided scale)
* **RSI:** 59.46 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.21 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -17.9% (Short-term downward trend)

The current price increase is moderate and doesn't indicate a dramatic surge or plunge. The negative expected return warrants careful consideration.  The high MRI suggests heightened market risk.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has shown some inconsistencies in meeting or exceeding EPS expectations. While some quarters exceeded expectations (2024-08-06, 2024-05-07), others fell short (2024-11-07, 2024-02-08).  The most recent earnings (2025-02-13) slightly exceeded expectations. Further analysis is needed to determine the trend.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

DUK shows a history of outperforming the S&P 500, with a positive alpha and relatively low beta. However, recent indicators (negative PPO, high MRI, and negative expected return) suggest caution.  The company's financials are generally healthy, with stable revenue and reasonable profit margins, but inconsistency in earnings and ROE requires further investigation.  A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) could potentially yield above-market returns as suggested by historical data, but current market conditions and risk indicators necessitate careful consideration.  Further due diligence is highly recommended before making any investment decisions.
