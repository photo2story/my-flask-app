**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $116.69
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $115.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $111.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $110.89

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small gap between the price and the moving averages indicates that the upward momentum might be weakening.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 78.21 -  This indicates an overbought condition, suggesting a potential pullback is likely.
* **PPO:** 0.54 -  A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.6 -  This implies a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -150.6% - This negative expected return, relative to the S&P 500, strongly suggests that long-term investment may not yield positive returns compared to the benchmark.  Given the already significant underperformance, careful consideration of this projection is crucial. The recent price change of $0.94 suggests a small positive movement, not a dramatic price jump.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

DUK currently shows mixed signals. While the company boasts strong revenue and profit margins, its significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the negative long-term expected return raise significant concerns.  The overbought RSI suggests a potential pullback is imminent.  While short-term indicators like moving averages show positive momentum, the long-term outlook is bearish given the consistently negative alpha and a projected significant underperformance compared to the market index.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.  The low ROE also warrants further investigation into the company's capital efficiency.
