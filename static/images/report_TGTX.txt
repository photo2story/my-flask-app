*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.8 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI of 31.96 indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, though it doesn't guarantee an immediate price reversal.
*   The negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a downward trend.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a buying opportunity.
*   The recent increase in relative divergence (+0.8) suggests short-term upward movement.
*   The very low expected return indicates that the stock is currently considered unattractive for long-term investment (more than 2 years).

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **[2025-11-03] Earnings Caveat Sent Biotech Diving:** Indicates potential concerns or negative aspects related to a recent earnings report.
*   **[2025-12-18] Trending Among Retail Traders:** Might suggest increased volatility and speculative interest.
*   **[2025-11-28] Fireside Chat at Evercore Event:**  A corporate event where information might be shared about the company's future plans or current status.
*   **[2025-11-17] Q3'25 Earnings Positives, But Competitors Progressing:** Suggests mixed news – positive aspects of TG Therapeutics' own performance but growing competitive pressure.
*   **[2025-12-06] Stock Drop Looks Sharp, But How Deep Can It Go?:** Points to a recent sharp decline and uncertainty about the future.
*   **[2025-10-27] Earnings Expected to Grow Ahead of Q3 Release:** This is outdated information; the actual Q3 release occurred in November, and the news above suggests it wasn't entirely positive.

**Analysis:** The news headlines paint a mixed picture. While there's some positive coverage, the focus on sharp stock drops and competitive pressures suggests caution is warranted.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** No key indicated, but 7 opinions exist.
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 44.29 / 60.00 / 13.00

**Analysis:**  The wide range between the high and low target prices (60.00 vs. 13.00) indicates a lack of strong consensus among analysts regarding the stock's future potential. The average target price (44.29) suggests potential upside from the current price, but the low target price represents substantial downside risk. The absence of information on Recent Rating Changes makes judging the stock more difficult.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출    |
|------------|------|---------|
| 2025-11-05 | 2.69 | 0.16 B$ |
| 2025-08-08 | 0.19 | 0.14 B$ |
| 2025-05-09 | 0.03 | 0.12 B$ |
| 2024-11-07 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$ |
| 2025-11-05 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$ |

**Analysis:**

*   The most recent EPS (2.69) is significantly higher than previous quarters. This is very encouraging but needs to be carefully examined in conjunction with the news headlines that cited "earnings caveats". A big one-time gain or accounting adjustment could skew the EPS number.
*   Revenue has been steadily increasing over the past several quarters. This is a positive trend.
*   The table has two identical dates (2025-11-05). This might be an error, suggesting only 4 quarters of data are available.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.16B     | 82.63%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.14B     | 86.58%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.12B     | 87.14%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.11B     | 85.77%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.08B     | 88.86%        |

**Analysis:**

*   Revenue has been steadily increasing over the past five quarters. This is a positive sign.
*   Profit margins are consistently very high, indicating strong operational efficiency and pricing power (or potentially, specific accounting treatments that inflate the margin).

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE       |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.61B    | 64.37%    |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.28B    | 10.20%    |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.24B    | 2.13%     |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.22B    | 10.49%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.19B    | 2.02%     |

**Analysis:**

*   Equity has increased significantly in the most recent quarter (2025-09-30), which may be related to the positive EPS reported in the quarter ending in November.
*   ROE (Return on Equity) is highly variable, with a massive spike in the most recent quarter (64.37%). This dramatic increase is likely related to the increase in Equity and EPS noted above. This needs further investigation to determine its sustainability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

TG Therapeutics (TGTX) presents a mixed and complex investment picture.

*   **Underperformance:** The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.
*   **Volatility:**  Historical data reveals significant price volatility, as evidenced by the high Maximum Drawdown and fluctuating CAGR.
*   **Recent Downtrend:** The current stock price is below key moving averages, suggesting a recent downward trend.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The RSI is nearing oversold territory, which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity. The negative PPO confirms the downward trend. The 'Hybrid Signal' suggests a buying opportunity, but with caution given the -127.3% expected return.
*   **Mixed News:**  Recent news headlines highlight both positive aspects (e.g., Q3 earnings) and concerns (e.g., competitive pressures, stock drops). It's crucial to delve deeper into the reasons behind the "earnings caveat" mentioned in one article.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** The wide range in analyst target prices suggests a lack of strong consensus regarding the stock's future.
*   **Strong Financials (with Caveats):**  Revenue and profit margins are strong, but the dramatic increase in EPS, Equity, and ROE in the most recent quarter warrants further investigation to determine its underlying cause and sustainability. A one-time gain or accounting change could be responsible.
*   **High Risk:** Given the underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative excess expected return compared to the S&P 500, the significant risks highlighted, and the mixed analyst opinions, TGTX is best suited for risk-tolerant investors who are well-informed about the biotechnology industry and the company's specific pipeline and challenges.

**In Conclusion:**

TGTX is a high-risk, high-reward stock. The recent price decline *could* represent a buying opportunity if an investor believes in the company's long-term potential, but the negative expected return and the significant risks need to be carefully considered. Further research is essential to understand the reasons for the recent stock declines, the potential impact of competitive pressures, and the sustainability of the recent improvements in earnings and financial metrics.
