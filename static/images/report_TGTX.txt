*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | -5.0% | 73.5% | -33.0% | -0.0 | 1.3 |

| 2018-2020  | 316.0% | 74.1% | 293.0% | 0.1 | 8.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 124.0% | 74.1% | 78.0% | 0.3 | 3.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -71.0% | 77.8% | -71.0% | -0.0 | 1.9 |
| 2021-2023  | -284.0% | 77.8% | -285.0% | -1.1 | 2.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 56.0% | 77.8% | 36.0% | -1.0 | 4.8 |
| 2023-2025  | 72.0% | 80.7% | 7.0% | -0.1 | 4.9 |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** Fluctuating significantly, with periods of high growth (2018-2020) and severe decline (2021-2023).  The last two periods show positive growth.
    *   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown, indicating significant risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha generally reflects the stock's ability to generate returns independent of the market. The Alpha follows a similar pattern to CAGR, showing periods of outperformance and underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values are relatively low, and even negative, suggesting the stock has not closely tracked the market (S&P 500) performance over these periods.  Negative betas suggest an inverse relationship to the market - when the market goes up, this stock tends to go down (and vice versa). But the betas close to 0 suggest the stock is largely uncorrelated to the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 30.98
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 30.98
    *   Previous Close: 29.93
    *   Change: 3.51%
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 30.848
    *   20-day SMA: 31.41
    *   60-day SMA: 33.0494
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The current price is above the 5-day SMA but below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend, but it is still facing resistance from longer-term trends.  The 3.51% change is a noteworthy positive movement in the very short term.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 51.81
*   **PPO:** 0.0432
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (32 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -126.8%
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The RSI of 51.81 indicates a neutral condition (neither overbought nor oversold).
    *   PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of 0.0432 indicates the short-term moving average is slightly above the longer-term moving average, confirming the short-term upward trend suggested by the SMA analysis.
    *   The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium investment recommendation.
    *   The Hybrid Signal leans bullish.
    *   The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days suggests a recent weakening of the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500.
    *   The significantly negative expected return (-126.8%) indicates very high risk and poor long-term prospects based on the current data.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-11-05 | 2.69 | 0.16 B$     |
| 2025-08-08 | 0.19 | 0.14 B$     |
| 2025-05-09 | 0.03 | 0.12 B$     |

| 2025-11-05 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$     |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The most recent EPS (2.69) shows a large, positive, and unusual value compared to previous periods. It could be due to a one-time event, accounting adjustments, or a truly significant improvement in profitability.  This single data point significantly skews any analysis. Revenue has been consistently increasing over the quarters.

**6) Financial Information**

*Revenue and Profitability:*

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|

*Capital and Profitability:*

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE     |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.61B    | 64.37%  |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.28B    | 10.20%  |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.24B    | 2.13%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.22B    | 10.49%  |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B    | 2.02%   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Revenue has been steadily increasing. The profit margins are exceptionally high for a biotech company.
    *   Equity has increased significantly, especially in the most recent quarter. The most recent ROE (64.37%) is extraordinarily high. This could be due to the large jump in equity and requires further investigation to understand the drivers.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Summary:** TGTX presents a mixed picture. While recent revenue growth, a large, one-time earnings, and the positive Hybrid Signal and Analyst Target Price are encouraging, the historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high MDD, recent decline in relative divergence, and significantly negative expected return are concerning. The company's financials show increasing revenue, very high profit margins, and a substantial increase in equity and ROE, but these also warrant further scrutiny to understand their sustainability.

*   **Investment Recommendation:** Based on the data provided, a **cautious and informed approach is recommended**. The stock's volatility, high risk indicators, and mixed news sentiment suggest a high-risk investment. The analyst target price suggests potential upside, but the wide range underscores the uncertainty. The positive recent changes, like the jump in the recent earning's EPS, require further observation. The long-term expected return is deeply concerning, suggesting high risks outweigh potential returns.
