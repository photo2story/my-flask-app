    *   **Beta:** Consistently above 1, indicating TGTX is more volatile than the market.
    *   **Alpha:**  Highly variable, ranging from strongly positive (outperforming the market on a risk-adjusted basis) to deeply negative (underperforming significantly). The recent periods (2020-2022, 2021-2023) show very poor Alpha, while earlier periods (2018-2020, 2019-2021) were strong.

    *   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values indicate considerable price declines within each period.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   The current price ($29.28) is below all three Simple Moving Averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This suggests a recent downward trend in the stock price. The positive price movement on the last market is a good sign.

*   **RSI (29.70):**  This is below 30, indicating an oversold condition.  The stock *might* be due for a potential rebound.
*   **PPO (-0.3366):** A negative PPO suggests a downward trend in the stock price momentum.
*   **MRI (0.8):**  A "Medium Investment" recommendation from the MRI suggests moderate risk, however the 'Hybrid Signal' is suggesting 100% of available cash should be invested.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (-1.9):**  Confirms a recent short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return (-76.1%):** This is a *very* negative long-term return forecast, suggesting significant concerns about the company's future prospects.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed News:** The news headlines present a mixed picture.

    *   Other articles offer more positive perspectives ("TG Therapeutics: What Wall Street Isn't Telling You," "Discipline and Rules-Based Execution") or acknowledge the company's growth ("Deloitte Fast 500 names TG Therapeutics").
*   **Key Takeaway:**  The news reflects a high degree of uncertainty and differing opinions about TGTX's prospects.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** The analyst consensus is neutral to negative, with an average target price of $44.29.  However, the wide range in target prices ($13.00 to $60.00) underscores the uncertainty.  The lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to interpret the analysts' confidence.
