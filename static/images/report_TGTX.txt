| 2023-2025  | 71.0%  | 80.7% | 6.0%    | -0.1   | 4.9    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Shows volatile returns, ranging from significant losses to substantial gains. Recent periods (2020-2022, 2021-2023) have been particularly challenging.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant risk and volatility in the stock's price.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha fluctuates significantly, but is overwhelmingly positive during periods of strong growth, and negative during periods of decline. This suggests that the stock is either adding a lot of value or subtracting a lot of value compared to its peers.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, indicating relatively low correlation with the broader market, but the -1.1 and -1.0 numbers are an indication of inverse correlation with the market in those time frames.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 30.7
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 30.71, 'previousClose': 31.67, 'change': -3.03}
*   **5-day SMA:** 32.476
*   **20-day SMA:** 31.927
*   **60-day SMA:** 33.5222

**Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), which is generally considered a bearish signal. The recent price decrease (change: -3.03) confirms the short-term downward trend.

**3) RSI, PPO Index Indicators and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence, Expected_Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 52.35 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.5183 (Positive)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (32 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -105.5 (Significant long-term underperformance compared to S&P 500 is expected)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests that the stock is considered to be in the "Medium Investment" zone, meaning that it is not overly risky.
*   The RSI value is close to 50, indicating a neutral momentum.
*   The PPO is slightly positive and that the Hybrid Signal suggests a full buy, and these both disagree with the large expected return (which says the company will do very badly in the future).
*   The negative divergence change confirms the recent downward trend.
*   The very low expected return is concerning.

*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has increased significantly, especially in the most recent quarter. ROE (Return on Equity) is extremely high in the most recent quarter, suggesting efficient use of shareholder equity to generate profits. However, ROE fluctuates dramatically, so that one number could be an outlier.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

TG Therapeutics (TGTX) presents a mixed picture. While recent financial performance shows strong revenue growth, high profit margins, and a high ROE, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a negative divergence and a concerningly negative expected long-term return. Recent price action is bearish, with the price below key moving averages. Analyst opinions are mixed, with a high average target price but also a wide range of targets, reflecting uncertainty.

The most recent earnings data is particularly encouraging with high earnings per share, however the technicals suggest that this run is soon to end.

**Overall Assessment:**

TGTX appears to be a high-risk, high-reward stock. The strong recent financial performance and high analyst target prices offer potential upside, but the underperformance relative to the market, negative technical signals, and mixed news headlines indicate significant downside risk. Investors should conduct thorough due diligence and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in TGTX.
