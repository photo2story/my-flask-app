**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates dramatically, with periods of significant growth (2018-2020, 2019-2021) and severe declines (2021-2023). This highlights the volatile nature of the stock.
*   **MDD:** The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and potential for significant losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, representing excess return compared to the market, is similarly volatile. The negative Alpha values in several periods (especially 2021-2023) reinforce the underperformance relative to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates and is sometimes negative, suggesting TGTX's price movements are less correlated with the overall market and may even move in the opposite direction at times. This could be due to company-specific news and developments dominating its price action rather than broader market trends.
*   **Market Cap:** The company's market capitalization has also fluctuated significantly, reflecting the stock's volatility.

**Analysis:** The current price (30.73) is below the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which are both below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term downward trend. The recent price decrease (change of -1.25) reinforces this.
