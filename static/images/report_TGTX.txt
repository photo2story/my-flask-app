Okay, here's a report based on the provided data, structured as requested:

**1) Return Rate Comparison (TGTX vs. VOO)**

*   **TGTX: TG Therapeutics Inc -** A biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapies for the treatment of B-cell malignancies and autoimmune diseases.
*   **Cumulative Return (TGTX):** 65.26%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -37.0 (Relative Divergence: 15.7)

**Analysis:** TGTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period. The negative divergence of -37.0 indicates the performance gap. A relative divergence of 15.7 suggests the performance is closer to its minimum divergence than its maximum, indicating sustained recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | 74.0%   | 80.7%   | -32.0% | -0.0 | 4.8    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** A high CAGR of 74.0% suggests strong potential growth over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** A very high MDD of 80.7% indicates very high volatility and risk. This means the stock experienced a significant drop from peak to trough during the observed timeframe.
*   **Alpha:** A negative Alpha of -32.0% suggests that the stock underperformed relative to its benchmark, even after accounting for risk.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of -0.0 implies that the stock price is uncorrelated or negatively correlated with the movement of the overall market and is a stable stock (lower volitality).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization is 4.8 Billion.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 29.75
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 30.01, Previous Close: 29.75, Change: 0.87
*   **5-day SMA:** 30.57
*   **20-day SMA:** 30.892
*   **60-day SMA:** 32.4829

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), which could be interpreted as a short-term downtrend. The last market data shows a positive change, a slight rebound.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 45.57 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.0887 (Slightly negative, indicating a potential downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (32 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.1 (단기하락 - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -147.5 (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, but the negative expected return casts significant doubt on the long-term potential. A RSI near 50 and a slightly negative PPO suggest that the trend is flat. The hybrid signal advocates for full investment. The recent decline in relative divergence (compared to S&P 500) confirms short-term underperformance. The negative expected return (-147.5%) indicates significant underperformance relative to S&P 500 if held long-term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Headlines:** Articles suggest potential undervaluation, historical gains, and a "Moderate Buy" recommendation.

*   **Negative Headlines:** One article highlights an earnings caveat that led to a price drop.

**Analysis:** News sentiment is mixed. There are arguments for potential undervaluation and analyst optimism, but also a recent negative event related to earnings.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Moderate Buy
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 44.29 / 60.00 / 13.00

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a "Moderate Buy" rating with a target price significantly above the current price, suggesting potential upside. The large range between the high and low target prices reflects uncertainty in valuation.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Underperformance:** TGTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **High Risk, High Potential Reward:** High CAGR is offset by a very high MDD, indicating substantial risk.
*   **Technical Indicators:** Current price below moving averages suggests a potential downtrend, while the RSI is neutral.
*   **Mixed Sentiment:** News and analyst opinions are mixed, with potential upside balanced by recent setbacks.
*   **Strong Financial Performance:** Revenue, profit margins, equity, and ROE are generally trending positively.
*   **Warning:** The negative expected return (-147.5%) indicates underperformance relative to S&P 500 if held long-term, which is very important and contradicts to the high investment recommended.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data presents a mixed picture. While the company shows strong financial performance and analysts are generally positive, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the high volatility, and the negative expected return are significant concerns. The high investment recommendation from the MRI conflicts to the underperformance. Therefore, it would be suggested to be cautious.
