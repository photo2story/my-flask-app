**7. Overall Analysis**

TG Therapeutics presents a mixed investment profile.  On one hand, the company shows progress with its BRIUMVI drug, evidenced by the commencement of Phase 3 trials and positive data presentations.  Recent earnings and revenue growth are encouraging.  The high profit margins, if sustainable, are impressive.  The analyst target prices suggest potential upside. The CEO's confidence and the stock buyback programs signal management believes the company is undervalued.

However, significant concerns exist. The extremely negative expected return over the long term is a major red flag.  The high historical volatility (MDD) and the overbought RSI signal potential short-term downside. The wide range in analyst target prices underscores considerable uncertainty. While the absolute cumulative return is positive, the relative divergence indicates recent underperformance compared to its historical patterns relative to the S&P 500. Furthermore, the fluctuating ROE suggests inconsistent profitability.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted. While the recent positive news and growth trends are encouraging, the negative long-term expected return and high volatility should give investors pause.  Further research is needed to understand the drivers behind the negative expected return and the sustainability of the high profit margins.  A small, speculative position *might* be considered for investors with a high-risk tolerance, but only after a thorough understanding of the risks involved.  A more conservative strategy would be to wait for more clarity regarding the company's long-term prospects before investing.
