| 2023-2025  | 66.0%  | 80.7%  | -1.0%  | -0.1  | 4.7    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates wildly, showing high growth periods (2018-2020, 2019-2021) interspersed with significant declines (2021-2023).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD consistently indicate significant risk and volatility.  Drawdowns hover around 70-80%, meaning investors experience large percentage declines from peak values.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are highly variable, reflecting periods of both significant outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha) relative to the market. Recent years show large negative Alpha.
*   **Beta:** Beta hovers around 0, and even negative in recent periods.
*   **Cap(B):** Market cap fluctuates, indicating the company's size changes in the market over time.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 29.75
*   **Last-Market Data:** {'price': 29.75, 'previousClose': 30.53, 'change': -2.55} (Indicates a recent decrease in price)
*   **5-day SMA:** 30.57
*   **20-day SMA:** 30.89
*   **60-day SMA:** 32.48

**Analysis:** The price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. The negative change in the last market further supports this.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 45.57 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.0887 (Slightly negative, indicating potential short-term weakness)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (32 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -134.8 (Very negative, suggesting significant underperformance compared to S&P 500 in the long term)

**Analysis:**

*   Despite the "High Investment Recommended" from the MRI, the extremely negative expected return should raise concerns. The MRI seems contradictory to other indicators.
*   The RSI is neutral.
*   While the PPO suggests short-term weakness, the recent change in relative divergence indicates a recent upward trend.
* The recommendation of the hybrid signal is that you should buy 100% of available cash to increase the number of shares to 32; also, if you buy in small portions every month, this will have less impact overall than the investment of 100% of cash.
**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Headlines:**
    *   Wall Street Isn't Telling You (Seeking Alpha) - Suggests potential hidden risks or opportunities.
    *   Investing three years ago would have delivered you a 160% gain (Yahoo Finance) - Highlights past performance, which may not be indicative of future results.
    *   Could The Market Be Wrong About TG Therapeutics, Inc. (simplywall.st) - Questions market valuation based on financial prospects.
    *   The Earnings Caveat That Sent This Hot Biotech Diving (Investor's Business Daily) - Implies a recent negative event related to earnings.
    *   TG Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:TGTX) Receives Average Recommendation of "Moderate Buy" from Brokerages (MarketBeat) - Indicates a generally positive, but not strongly optimistic, sentiment from analysts.
*   **Analysis:**  The news is mixed, with some articles suggesting potential undervaluation or hidden opportunities, while others point to past volatility, earnings concerns, and a "Moderate Buy" rating. The "Earnings Caveat" headline is particularly concerning.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Moderate Buy
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 44.29 / 60.00 / 13.00

**Analysis:** The moderate buy consensus and average target price of $44.29 suggests analysts see some upside potential (current price is $29.75). However, the very wide range between the high and low target prices ($13.00 to $60.00) indicates significant uncertainty and disagreement among analysts regarding the stock's future performance.  The lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the current analyst sentiment shift.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-11-05 | 2.69 | 0.16 B$     |
| 2025-08-08 | 0.19 | 0.14 B$     |
| 2025-05-09 | 0.03 | 0.12 B$     |

| 2025-11-05 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$     |

**Analysis:** The most recent EPS (2025-11-05) is significantly higher than previous quarters. Revenue has also been steadily increasing. However, one item shows up twice (2025-11-05) which seems to be an error.

**6) Financial Information**

*Revenue and Profitability:*

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.16B  | 82.63%        |

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE   |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.61B  | 64.37%|
| 2025-06-30   | $0.28B  | 10.20%|
| 2025-03-31   | $0.24B  | 2.13% |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.22B  | 10.49%|
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B  | 2.02% |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:**  Revenue is increasing steadily.
*   **Profit Margin:** Consistently high profit margins suggest strong pricing power or efficient cost management.
*   **Equity:** Equity has increased significantly in the most recent quarter, which may indicate a significant event (e.g., capital raise, positive earnings impact).
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is very high in the most recent quarter (64.37%), significantly higher than previous periods, likely due to the combination of increased equity and strong profitability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

TG Therapeutics presents a mixed picture:

*   **Underperformance:**  It has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, and historically exhibits periods of both high growth and substantial decline.
*   **Volatility:**  The stock is highly volatile, as indicated by the high MDD.
*   **Recent Positives:**  Recent earnings are strong, revenue is growing, and profit margins are high.  The significant increase in equity and ROE in the most recent quarter are positive signs. Recent news suggest it's a "Moderate Buy."
*   **Concerning Factors:**  The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. The "Earnings Caveat" headline also suggests potential risks.  The wide range in analyst price targets indicates uncertainty.
*   **Technicals:** The short-term downtrend suggested by the moving averages clashes with the "Buy" rating generated by the Hybrid Signal.

**Conclusion:** TGTX appears to be a high-risk, high-reward stock. Recent financial performance is encouraging, but the negative expected return, volatile historical performance, and mixed news headlines warrant caution. The high MRI score is a potential red herring given the many negative indicators. A thorough understanding of the "Earnings Caveat" mentioned in the news is crucial before considering investment. Investors should weigh the potential for future growth against the risk of significant losses.
