    *   **CAGR:** Volatile, with periods of significant growth (2018-2020) and substantial decline (2021-2023). Recent years show positive CAGR, but more moderate.
    *   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown consistently around 73-80%, indicating significant risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Fluctuates widely.  High positive Alpha in some periods (2018-2020) suggests outperformance relative to its risk.  Large negative Alpha indicates underperformance. The Alpha is currently low, meaning it's barely outperforming its benchmark.
    *   **Beta:** Generally low (close to 0 or negative), indicating that the stock's price is less sensitive to market movements than the S&P 500 and even moves in an inverse direction.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Cap is between 0.7B and 8.2B, which is mid-cap stock.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Simple Numbers:**
    *   Close: 30.77
    *   Last-market Price: 30.53
    *   Last-market Change: -0.78
    *   5-day SMA: 30.934
    *   20-day SMA: 31.076
    *   60-day SMA: 32.701

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs).  This suggests a short-term downward trend.  The recent price decrease of -0.78 could be considered a small downward price fluctuation.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

    *   MRI: 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
    *   RSI: 50.07
    *   PPO: 0.1629
    *   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (32 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)
    *   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -0.5 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
    *   Expected Return: -126.8%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** The high MRI suggests a high market sentiment in general, or maybe even the market generally recommends investment in TG Therapeutics Inc.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 50.07 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** A low PPO suggests the uptrend is slowly gaining strength, or the downtrend is slowly fading.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The system suggests a 100% buy-in strategy, considering the company to be very safe.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** A negative change in relative divergence indicates a short-term decline relative to the comparison stock (VOO).
    *   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return (-126.8%) suggests that, based on the model, the stock is predicted to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term. *This is a crucial point and suggests caution despite the MRI.*

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   The news headlines present a mixed picture:
    *   **Positive:** Some articles suggest the company's financial prospects may be underestimated ("Could The Market Be Wrong...").  Mentions of past gains ("Investing in TG Therapeutics... would have delivered you a 160% gain") and recognition as a fast-growing firm ("Deloitte Fast 500 names TG Therapeutics...") are also positive.
    *   **Negative:** One article highlights earnings caveats ("The Earnings Caveat That Sent This Hot Biotech Diving"), indicating concerns about recent financial performance.
    *   **Neutral/Mixed:** Some articles provide analyst ratings ("TG Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:TGTX) Receives Average Recommendation of 'Moderate Buy'...") and analysis of earnings ("TG Therapeutics: Positives From Q3'25 Earnings, But Competitors Progressing...").

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Simple Numbers:**
    *   Mean Analyst Recommendation: N/A (No rating specified, but 7 opinions)
    *   Target Price (avg/high/low): 44.29 / 60.00 / 13.00
    *   Recent Rating Changes: No changes indicated.

*   **Analysis:**  The analyst consensus is missing, but the fact that there are 7 opinions could indicate a moderate buy from brokerages. The average target price is significantly higher than the current price, suggesting analysts see potential upside, but the wide range between the high and low targets (60.00 vs 13.00) demonstrates considerable uncertainty.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

    | 날짜        | EPS  | 매출       |

    | 2025-11-05 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$    |

*   **Analysis:**  Recent EPS increased and reached at 2.69, while revenue is also increasing. TG Therapeutics Inc. had increased EPS & revenue, and that indicates a sign of company growth.

**6) Financial Information**

*   **Revenue and Profitability Table:**

    | Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
    | :----------- | :------ | :------------ |
    | 2025-09-30 | $0.16B | 82.63%        |

    | 2024-09-30 | $0.08B | 88.86%        |

*   **Capital and Profitability Table:**

    | Quarter      | Equity    | ROE     |
    | :----------- | :-------- | :------ |
    | 2025-09-30 | $0.61B | 64.37%  |
    | 2025-06-30 | $0.28B | 10.20%  |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has consistently increased over the past year.  Profit margins are very high and stable.  Equity has increased significantly, particularly in the most recent quarter.  ROE is highly variable, with a very high value in the latest quarter. This sudden jump in ROE could be something to investigate further as it seems potentially unsustainable.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

TG Therapeutics Inc. presents a complex and somewhat contradictory picture.

*   **Positives:**
    *   Strong revenue growth and high profit margins.
    *   Increasing equity.
    *   Analysts see potential upside (high target price), although with significant disagreement.
    *   High MRI (although its reliability should be questioned in light of other indicators).
    *   The system suggests a 100% buy-in strategy, which is quite interesting.

*   **Negatives/Concerns:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   High Maximum Drawdown indicates substantial risk.
    *   Significantly negative expected return suggests long-term underperformance.
    *   Volatile historical performance (CAGR and Alpha).
    *   Recent short-term price decline.
    *   Conflicting news headlines (caveats in earnings, competitor progress).
    *   The high ROE in the latest quarter warrants further investigation.

*   **Conclusion:** While TG Therapeutics shows promising financial performance in terms of revenue, profitability, and recent earnings, several red flags suggest caution. The company's underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the high risk profile (MDD), and the significantly negative expected return raise serious concerns. The positive MRI and the system's buy signal should be viewed skeptically in light of these other indicators. The stock appears to be a high-risk, high-reward investment.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions. It is important to investigate the reason for the recent spike in ROE and the underlying causes for the negative expected return. Consider reviewing TG Therapeutics' financial health and comparing their performance with their closest competitors in the same sector and industry, as this may give additional insights into any potential investments.
