**However, several cautions are warranted:**

*   **High Volatility:** The historical alpha/beta analysis and the large MDD figures show the stock is subject to high volatility.
*   **Overbought Condition:** The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought in the short term.
*   **Insider Selling:** The recent insider selling, while not necessarily a negative sign, should be noted.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The negative expected return is a significant concern, suggesting that the current price might not be sustainable in the long run.
*   **Market Risk Indicator:** MRI is medium, so it is not a safe time.

**In conclusion:**  TGTX appears to be a potentially rewarding but also risky investment. The positive clinical data and analyst sentiment are encouraging, but investors should be aware of the stock's volatility, overbought condition, and the concerning negative expected return. Further research and careful consideration of risk tolerance are advised.
