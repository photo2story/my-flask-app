**Conclusion:**

Investing in TGTX appears highly risky. While the financial metrics and analyst ratings present some positive aspects, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the large potential downside indicated by the expected return, and concerning news events warrant caution. The company's financials showing growth in recent quarters are encouraging, but it is important to dive deeper into the driver of these changes to decide if they are sustainable.

**Recommendation:** Due to the conflicting signals, a high-risk tolerance is required. Consider a very small allocation with a strong understanding of the company's fundamentals and competitive landscape. Closely monitor news, earnings releases, and analyst updates.
