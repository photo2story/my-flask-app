**Analysis:** Recent news paints a mixed picture. While there are positive aspects like recognition for growth, there are concerns about profitability, competition, and earnings caveats. The options market predicting a spike indicates potential volatility.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Mean Consensus:** - (no clear rating from the average of the seven opinions)
*   **Opinions:** 7
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 44.29 / 60.00 / 13.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not Provided

**Analysis:** The wide range of target prices ($13 to $60) indicates a high degree of uncertainty among analysts regarding the company's future. The average target price of $44.29 suggests potential upside from the current price, but the low target indicates significant downside risk. The lack of recent rating changes data hinders a comprehensive assessment.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-11-05 | 2.69 | 0.16 B$    |
| 2025-08-08 | 0.19 | 0.14 B$    |
| 2025-05-09 | 0.03 | 0.12 B$    |
| 2024-11-07 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$    |
| 2025-11-05 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$    |

**Analysis:** The most recent EPS of 2.69 is a huge outlier, significantly exceeding previous quarters. Revenue has also been growing steadily. The EPS of 2.69 should be noted with a big caveat, as the other EPS values are a small fraction of it. It would be necessary to delve deeper into the nature of the large EPS value to fully analyze the implications.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.16B  | 82.63%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.14B  | 86.58%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.12B  | 87.14%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.11B  | 85.77%        |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B  | 2.02%    |

**Analysis:** Revenue has been steadily increasing, and profit margins are exceptionally high. The significant increase in equity in the most recent quarter (2025-09-30) and the very high ROE of 64.37% suggests a significant event impacted capital. This is also highly unusual, so needs additional context.

TG Therapeutics Inc. (TGTX) presents a highly complex and risky investment profile.
