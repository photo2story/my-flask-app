**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

TGTX shows a mixed financial picture. While revenue and profit margins look strong, the company has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. The volatile alpha and beta values indicate considerable risk and sensitivity to company-specific events rather than overall market trends.  The negative expected return and high MDD are major concerns. Recent news suggests the company is experiencing significant volatility. The increasing equity is a positive sign, but the inconsistent ROE and significant expected underperformance warrant caution.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the analysis, a cautious approach to TGTX is warranted. The strong revenue and profit margins are encouraging, but the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, coupled with a negative expected return, suggests a high degree of risk. Investors should closely monitor company news, earnings reports, and developments in the biopharmaceutical industry before making any investment decisions. It would be best to wait for a positive shift in expected returns and a more consistent track record of outperforming the market.
