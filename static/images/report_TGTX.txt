**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|

**Analysis:** The EPS shows a significant spike in the most recent report (2025-11-05), followed by two lower-valued earnings reports (2025-08-08, 2025-05-09), and is worth further investigation because the date listed occurs twice.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

TG Therapeutics presents a mixed investment picture. While it has experienced periods of high growth and shows recent revenue and equity gains, there are significant concerns:

*   **High Volatility:** The stock is highly volatile, as indicated by the large MDDs.
*   **Earnings Concerns:** Recent news highlights earnings and margin pressures, despite the recent spike in EPS. The reasons of EPS and ROE fluctuation need to be investigated.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** The wide range in analyst target prices reflects uncertainty about the stock's future.
*   **Negative Long-Term Outlook:** The extremely negative expected return signals a strong bearish outlook.

**Conclusion:** Based on the available data, an investment in TG Therapeutics appears risky. While the company has demonstrated growth potential and high profit margins, the recent earnings concerns, competitive pressures, and underperformance against the S&P 500 warrant caution. Further research is needed to understand the recent EPS and ROE fluctuations and the underlying reasons for the negative long-term outlook before making an investment decision.
