**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Showing a clear upward trend, indicating increasing sales.
*   **Profit Margin:** Consistently high, suggesting good cost control or strong pricing power.
*   **Equity:** Significant increase in the most recent quarter.  This likely indicates a capital raise (issuing new shares) or retained earnings from profits.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):**  The huge jump in ROE in the last quarter is likely related to the large increase in equity, *combined* with the large EPS reported during that period.  This needs further investigation to understand the source of that EPS jump.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

TG Therapeutics presents a mixed picture:

*   **Negatives:**
    *   Underperformed the S&P 500.
    *   High volatility and maximum drawdown.
    *   Very negative expected return, suggesting caution.
    *   Recent price decline and negative divergence change.
    *   The "Earnings Caveat" news article suggests there may be hidden issues with the recent earnings.
*   **Positives:**
    *   Strong revenue growth and high profit margins.
    *   Recent positive earnings surprise (high EPS).
    *   Institutional investment.
    *   Listed as one of North America's fastest growing firms.
    *   Recent progress in Multiple Sclerosis treatments.
    *   The hybrid signal recommends buying.

**Conclusion:**

TGTX appears to be a high-risk, high-reward stock. Its recent growth and profitability are encouraging, but the underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the extremely negative expected return, and the high volatility warrant caution. The positive recent earning is probably a one-off outlier because most of the signals are still bad.
