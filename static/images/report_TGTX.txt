**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Shows significant volatility, with periods of both massive gains (2018-2020) and substantial losses (2021-2023).
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate significant risk.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are highly variable, mirroring the CAGR. This suggests periods of significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the benchmark. Note the negative Alpha in recent years.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low (close to 0 or even negative), indicating the stock's price is not strongly correlated with the overall market. This means TGTX's price movements are largely independent of the S&P 500.  The negative beta in recent periods suggests that TGTX's price tends to move in the opposite direction of the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated, reflecting the stock's volatile performance.

*   **20-day SMA:** 31.41
*   **60-day SMA:** 33.0494

**Analysis:** The stock price closed higher than the 5-day SMA, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, the 20-day and 60-day SMAs are higher than the current price, suggesting a longer-term downtrend. The recent 3.51% change from the previous close indicates some upward momentum.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 51.81 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.0432 (Slightly above zero, indicating a potential uptrend, but very weak)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (32 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.8 (+)  단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -127.3%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI indicates a neutral position, suggesting neither strong buying nor selling pressure.
*   The PPO is slightly positive but not significant.
*   The hybrid signal is aggressively bullish, recommending buying with all available cash, but this is contradicted by other indicators like the negative expected return.
*   The 20-day relative divergence change suggests a recent upward trend.
*   The **highly negative expected return (-127.3%) is a major red flag.** It suggests that, based on current analysis, a long-term investment in TGTX is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes:** The news headlines present a mixed picture.
    *   **Concerns:** An article mentions an "Earnings Caveat" that led to a stock decline.
    *   **Options Market Activity:**  Zacks reports on options market activity suggesting a possible spike in the stock price.
    *   **Resilience:** One article suggests the stock remains resilient.
    *   **Green Energy Trends:** An article speculates about TGTX benefiting from green energy trends (unclear how relevant this is without further context – needs investigation).
    *   **Fireside Chat:**  An upcoming fireside chat might provide more information.
    *   **Competitor Progress:**  A Seeking Alpha article notes both positives from earnings but also highlights progress by competitors.

**Analysis:** The news indicates uncertainty surrounding TGTX. The "Earnings Caveat" and competitor progress are concerning. The resilience and potential spike are positive but speculative. The "green energy trends" link is unclear and requires further investigation.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:**  No strong buy/sell consensus is available.
*   **Opinions:** 7 analysts.
*   **Target Price:** Average: 44.29, High: 60.00, Low: 13.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent rating changes are provided.

**Analysis:** The wide range in target prices (13.00 to 60.00) highlights the uncertainty and differing opinions surrounding TGTX's future. The average target price is higher than the current price, suggesting potential upside if analysts are correct, but the wide range makes this less convincing. The lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess current sentiment.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출        |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-11-05 | 2.69 | 0.16 B$     |
| 2025-08-08 | 0.19 | 0.14 B$     |

| 2025-11-05 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$     |

**Analysis:**

*   **EPS:**  The most recent EPS (2.69) is significantly higher than previous quarters. This is a positive sign, but it's crucial to understand the reasons behind this large jump (one-time gain? sustainable improvement?). The earlier listed duplicate entry shows a previous EPS of $0.03 on the same date, indicating a possible error.
*   **Revenue:** Revenue has been increasing steadily over the past few quarters. This suggests growth in the company's business.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Consistent growth in revenue is a positive indicator.
*   **Profit Margin:** Very high and relatively stable profit margins suggest efficient operations.
*   **Equity:** Equity has increased significantly, especially in the most recent quarter.
*   **ROE:** The recent ROE of 64.37% is exceptionally high, particularly in the most recent quarter. This could be a one-time event.  The other ROE values are much lower, so the cause of this huge increase should be investigated.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance:** TGTX has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly.
*   **Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility and risk (high MDD).
*   **Independent Movement:** The stock's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market (low Beta).
*   **Mixed Signals:**  The technical indicators and analyst opinions present a mixed picture. The recent upward price movement and neutral RSI are tempered by the longer-term downtrend suggested by the SMAs and the wide range in analyst price targets.
*   **Concerning Expected Return:** The highly negative expected return (-127.3%) is a major cause for concern, indicating significant potential for underperformance relative to the market.
*   **Positive Financial Trends:** Revenue and profit margins are strong and improving. The recent EPS and ROE increases are significant positives, but require further investigation to determine their sustainability.
*   **News Uncertainty:**  Recent news highlights both potential risks and opportunities.
*   **Overall Assessment:** TGTX appears to be a high-risk, high-reward investment. The recent positive financial trends are encouraging, but the negative expected return, past underperformance, high volatility, and mixed news headlines suggest caution.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a conservative investor should likely avoid TGTX. A more aggressive investor might consider a small, speculative position, but only after thoroughly investigating the reasons behind the recent financial improvements, particularly the large EPS and ROE increases, and carefully considering the risks. It's crucial to stay informed about the company's progress and any new developments.
