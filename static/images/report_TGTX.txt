**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Highly variable, ranging from significant losses to substantial gains.  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows positive growth (71.0%).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.

*   **Cap(B):** Shows that the company's market capitalization has changed through time.

**Conclusion:**

TGTX is a high-risk, high-reward stock. While there are positive signs in terms of revenue growth and potential earnings improvements, the stock's history of underperformance, high volatility, and negative expected return warrant caution.

**Recommendation:**

A potential investor should proceed with caution. If the latest high EPS result is accurate and sustainable, and the company can maintain its revenue growth and profit margins, the stock could offer significant upside potential. However, the high volatility and negative expected return suggest that this investment is only suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon.  Further investigation is needed to clarify the EPS data and understand the long-term sustainability of the company's growth and profitability.
