**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis):**

TGTX is a volatile stock in a dynamic sector. Recent earnings show promise with increased revenue and EPS, and strong profit margins are a positive sign.

Recent news events are driving volatility, requiring close monitoring. The Hybrid Signal recommends caution, suggesting reducing holdings and increasing cash.

**In conclusion, based on the data provided, TGTX appears to be a high-risk investment at the current time. While there are some positive signals (recent earnings, high profit margins), the underperformance, negative outlook, and volatile price action warrant extreme caution. Further investigation into the recent news and a careful assessment of the company's future prospects are crucial before making any investment decisions.**
