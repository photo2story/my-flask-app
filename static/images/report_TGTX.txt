**6. Financial Information**

| :--------- | :------ | :------------ |
| 2025-06-30 | \$0.14B | 86.58%        |
| 2025-03-31 | \$0.12B | 87.14%        |
| 2024-12-31 | \$0.11B | 85.77%        |
| 2024-09-30 | \$0.08B | 88.86%        |
| 2024-06-30 | \$0.07B | 88.70%        |

| Quarter    | Equity | ROE      |
| :--------- | :------ | :------- |
| 2025-06-30 | \$0.28B | 10.20%  |
| 2025-03-31 | \$0.24B | 2.13%   |
| 2024-12-31 | \$0.22B | 10.49%  |

| 2024-06-30 | \$0.18B | 3.87%   |

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue has been consistently increasing, and profit margins are exceptionally high. This could be due to the nature of the biopharmaceutical industry, where successful drugs have high margins.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is growing, and ROE is volatile but generally positive, indicating improving financial health.

**7. 종합 Analysis**

*   **Mixed Signals:** TGTX presents a mixed picture. Recent positive news catalysts (buyback program, CEO confidence) and strong Q2 earnings have driven a short-term uptrend, as reflected in the moving averages and positive price change. The low MRI also suggests a stable market environment for the stock.
*   **Underperformance:**  However, TGTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, as evidenced by the negative accumulated return difference and Alpha values. The extremely negative expected return is also a major red flag.
*   **High Risk:** While recent financial performance has improved (Revenue, EPS, Profitability, ROE), the stock exhibits high MDD showing substantial price volatility.
*   **Overbought:** The RSI suggests the stock is overbought in the short term and a pullback is possible.
*   **Recommendation:** The hybrid signal and analyst target price suggest potential upside. **However, the extremely negative expected return and historical underperformance indicate substantial risk.** Investors should exercise caution and conduct further due diligence before investing. While the short-term trend is positive, the long-term outlook appears concerning based on the data provided.
