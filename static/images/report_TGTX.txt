*   **CAGR & MDD:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows very high volatility, ranging from significant losses (-315%) to substantial gains (332%).  Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values are also consistently high, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the investment's performance relative to the market (S&P 500) after accounting for risk (Beta). Large positive alpha values indicate outperformance, and large negative values indicate underperformance. Again, the wide range points to high volatility and periods of both strong and weak performance relative to the market.
*   **Beta:**  Beta measures the stock's volatility compared to the overall market. A beta above 1 indicates that the stock is more volatile than the market. TGTX's beta consistently exceeds 1, suggesting it's a riskier investment than the S&P 500.  The beta increased significantly in recent periods.

*   **Change:** -1.78 (negative, indicating a decrease)
*   **5-day SMA:** 30.028
*   **20-day SMA:** 30.7325
*   **60-day SMA:** 32.2716

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, reinforcing this downtrend signal.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 29.70 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.3366 (Negative, indicating a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (31 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (Indicates short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -71.7 (Significant negative expected return)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The RSI is below 30, indicating the stock is oversold and *could* be poised for a potential rebound. However, oversold conditions can persist.
    *   The negative PPO confirms the downtrend suggested by the moving averages.
    *   Despite the MRI suggesting medium investment due to safety, the hybrid signal and significantly negative expected return indicates very high risk. The recent divergence change also signals short-term decline. The combination of high-risk elements suggests cautiousness.
    *   The large negative "Expected Return" is concerning. It suggests analysts predict underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes:** The news headlines present a mixed picture:
    *   **Wall Street Concerns:** "TG Therapeutics: What Wall Street Isn't Telling You" suggests potential hidden risks or concerns not fully reflected in the stock price.
    *   **Financial Strength Doubts:** "TG Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:TGTX) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong" - this creates a conflicting message about financials.
    *   **Trading Discipline:** "Discipline and Rules-Based Execution in TGTX Response" implies active trading strategies and potentially volatility.
    *   **Earnings Caveat:** "The Earnings Caveat That Sent This Hot Biotech Diving" points to a specific earnings report that triggered a negative market reaction.

    *   **Earnings Call:** "TG Therapeutics (NASDAQ: TGTX) schedules Q3 results call, 8:30 a.m. ET, business update" - Regularly scheduled earnings calls can be market-moving events, as analysts and investors will scrutinize the company's performance and outlook.
*   **Overall:** The news flow leans cautiously negative. It suggests concerns about financial strength, potential hidden risks, a recent negative earnings event, and a high degree of speculation surrounding the stock.

    *   Average: 44.29

*   **Analysis:** The wide range between the high and low target prices (13.00 to 60.00) reflects significant disagreement among analysts regarding the future potential of the stock. The lack of consensus and recent rating changes makes it difficult to gauge analyst sentiment.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출      |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-11-05 | 2.69 | 0.16 B$   |

| 2024-11-07 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$   |
| 2025-11-05 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$   |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The most recent EPS (2.69) is significantly higher than the previous quarters. This *could* be a positive sign.
    *   Revenue has generally been increasing over the past year.
    *   However, be aware of potential data duplication (2024-11-07 and 2025-11-05 showing the same figures). This might need verification.

**6) Financial Information**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.16B   | 82.63%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.14B   | 86.58%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.12B   | 87.14%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.11B   | 85.77%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.08B   | 88.86%        |

*   **Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE   |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.61B   | 64.37% |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.28B   | 10.20% |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.24B   | 2.13%  |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.22B   | 10.49% |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B   | 2.02%  |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue & Profit Margin:** Revenue has steadily increased, and profit margins are exceptionally high. This suggests strong cost management and pricing power, but requires understanding of how these metrics are calculated.
    *   **Equity & ROE:** Equity has increased significantly, particularly in the most recent quarter. ROE (Return on Equity) also shows a dramatic spike in the last quarter. The surge in both equity and ROE could suggest a significant influx of capital, a major improvement in profitability, or a combination of both. However, the ROE is unusually high, so it should be investigated to see if there are any anomalies in the data.

Based on the information provided, TGTX presents a **high-risk, high-reward** investment opportunity. Here's a summary:

*   **Analyst Disagreement:** Wide range in analyst price targets indicates uncertainty about the stock's future value.
*   **Financial Strength:** Strong revenue growth, high profit margins, and a recent surge in equity and ROE are positive signals, but the abnormally high ROE should be further investigated.
*   **In conclusion:** While the company shows positive financial signals, the stock is high risk due to underperformance, negative outlook, mixed news, analyst disagreement, and volatility. Be extremely cautious when investing.
