**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Highly volatile, ranging from significantly negative to very high positive values, indicating a high-risk investment. The most recent CAGR is positive.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values consistently around 73.5% to 80.7% indicating significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the excess return of an investment relative to a benchmark index (here, presumably the S&P 500). Positive alpha indicates outperformance, while negative alpha indicates underperformance. The recent years show lower or even negative Alpha, except for 2022-2024, and 2023-2025, indicating decreasing value with respect to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the volatility of an investment relative to the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the investment is as volatile as the market, while a beta of less than 1 indicates that the investment is less volatile than the market, and a beta of greater than 1 indicates that the investment is more volatile than the market. All values were near 0, up until recently, where the negative Beta indicates that the stock price tends to move in the opposite direction from the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap (in Billions). Market Cap has fluctuated but is currently in the mid-range of its historical data.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 31.09

*   **5-day SMA:** 32.29
*   **20-day SMA:** 31.80
*   **60-day SMA:** 33.50

**Analysis:** The current price is below the 5-day and 60-day SMAs but above the 20-day SMA. This suggests a short-term pullback, but it's not a clear trend reversal yet. The positive change in the last market indicates a recent upward movement.

**3) Index Indicators Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 49.88 (Neutral)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.31 (Neutral)

*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -105.5% (Long-term underperformance compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   RSI indicates neutral momentum, neither overbought nor oversold.
*   PPO confirms a neutral trend.
*   Hybrid signal suggests a "buy" decision, potentially based on valuation or other factors.
*   The recent negative change in relative divergence reinforces the short-term underperformance.
*   The very negative expected return is a significant red flag, suggesting potential difficulties for the stock to generate value in the future.

| 2024-09-30 | $0.19B    | 2.02%   |

**Analysis:** Equity has increased significantly in the most recent quarter. The ROE (Return on Equity) is extremely high in the recent quarter, driven by the increased EPS. This is a very positive sign, but needs to be investigated to ensure it is sustainable.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Underperformance:** TGTX has underperformed the S&P 500, and the divergence is significant.
*   **High Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility as reflected in the CAGR and MDD.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The recent technical indicators (RSI, PPO) are neutral. The Hybrid Signal suggests buying.
*   **News Sentiment:** News is mixed, highlighting both opportunities and challenges.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Analyst opinions are widely dispersed.

**Overall Conclusion:**

TGTX is a high-risk, high-reward stock. The company has demonstrated improved financial performance recently, but significant risks and uncertainties remain. The divergence in the current price and analyst opinions suggests a high degree of uncertainty regarding the company's future trajectory. The very negative expected return is a red flag.

**Recommendation:** Further investigation into the drivers of the recent earnings and equity increases is warranted. Understanding the sustainability of those gains and carefully considering the risks are essential before making any investment decision.
