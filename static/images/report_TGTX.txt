**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Highly volatile, ranging from -284% to 316%, indicating significant year-to-year fluctuations.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high (73.5% - 80.6%), demonstrating substantial downside risk.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is also very volatile, but note how the 2018-2020 period shows significant positive alpha while 2021-2023 shows extreme negative alpha. This signifies periods of significant outperformance and underperformance relative to its risk-adjusted return.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates. The negative betas in recent periods (2021-2025) suggest that the stock has been moving inversely to the market, which is unusual.  This could indicate specific company issues are overshadowing broader market trends.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 30.60
*    **Last Market Data:** price: 31.35, previousClose: 32.0, change: -2.03
*   **5-day SMA:** 30.8
*   **20-day SMA:** 31.3595
*   **60-day SMA:** 33.4149

**Analysis:**  The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The price closed lower than the opening price today (Last Market Data), indicating further downward pressure.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 51.62 (Neutral - Neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.1892 (Neutral - Suggests the moving averages are closely aligned)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (31 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.3 (Indicates Short-term decline)
*    **Last Market Data:** {'price': 31.35, 'previousClose': 32.0, 'change': -2.03}. This fluctuation indicates an active trading day with a noticeable decrease in price.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -122.0% (Significant underperformance compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment risk. RSI and PPO are neutral. The "Hybrid Signal" recommends buying. However, the *very* negative Expected Return is a major red flag.  The recent divergence change confirms short-term downward momentum.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **[2025-12-12] (TGTX) Volatility Zones as Tactical Triggers:** Suggests trading opportunities based on price swings.
*   **[2025-11-03] The Earnings Caveat That Sent This Hot Biotech Diving:**  Highlights a negative earnings event.
*   **[2025-10-31] TG Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:TGTX) Stock Has Shown Weakness Lately But Financials Look Strong:**  Contradictory signals - weak stock performance, but supposedly strong financials.
*   **[2025-12-06] TG Therapeutics Stock Drop Looks Sharp, But How Deep Can It Go?:** Concerns about continued price decline.
*   **[2025-11-17] TG Therapeutics: Positives From Q3'25 Earnings, But Competitors Progressing (TGTX):**  Positive earnings offset by increasing competition.
*   **[2025-11-19] Deloitte Fast 500 names TG Therapeutics (NASDAQ: TGTX) among North America’s fastest-growing firms:**  Positive recognition, but potentially backward-looking (growth may have stalled).

**Analysis:** Recent news is mixed. While some articles point to positive aspects (fast growth, strong financials), the overriding theme is one of recent stock weakness, volatility, and increasing competition.  The "earnings caveat" headline is particularly concerning.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Mean:** Not Available
*   **Opinions:** 7
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 44.29 / 60.00 / 13.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not Available

**Analysis:** The wide range in target prices (13.00 to 60.00) suggests significant uncertainty among analysts regarding TGTX's future prospects. The average target price of $44.29 is significantly higher than the current price, potentially indicating undervaluation, *but the wide range makes this less reliable*. The lack of recent rating changes makes it hard to judge the current sentiment of analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출     |
|------------|------|----------|
| 2025-11-05 | 2.69 | 0.16 B$  |
| 2025-08-08 | 0.19 | 0.14 B$  |
| 2025-05-09 | 0.03 | 0.12 B$  |
| 2024-11-07 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$  |
| 2025-11-05 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$  |

**Analysis:** EPS increased significantly in the most recent quarter (2025-11-05), although this data appears to duplicate an earlier entry from 2024. Revenue has been steadily increasing, which is a positive sign. The massive jump in EPS needs careful verification - a one-time event can skew the numbers significantly.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|--------------|------------|----------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.16B     | 82.63%         |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.14B     | 86.58%         |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.12B     | 87.14%         |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.11B     | 85.77%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.08B     | 88.86%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE      |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.61B     | 64.37%   |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.28B     | 10.20%   |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.24B     | 2.13%    |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.22B     | 10.49%   |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.19B     | 2.02%    |

**Analysis:**

*   Revenue has consistently increased over the past five quarters.
*   Profit margins are exceptionally high, indicating strong pricing power or cost control.
*   Equity has increased significantly, particularly in the most recent quarter.
*   ROE is volatile but has increased sharply in the most recent quarter, corresponding to the increase in Equity.  Again, this recent jump should be investigated to determine its cause and sustainability.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

TGTX presents a mixed picture:

*   **Underperformance:** TGTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** High volatility in historical returns and a consistently high MDD indicate substantial risk.
*   **Recent Weakness:** Recent price action suggests a downtrend, confirmed by technical indicators.
*   **Mixed News:** Recent news highlights both positive and negative factors, with the negatives (earnings caveat, stock drop concerns) potentially outweighing the positives.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:**  A wide range in analyst target prices reflects uncertainty.
*   **Financial Strength (Potentially):** Revenue is growing, and profit margins are high. However, the most recent EPS and ROE spikes warrant further investigation to determine their sustainability.  The duplication in the earnings data table introduces some data reliability issues.
*   **Concerning Expected Return:** The -122% expected return is a significant red flag, suggesting very poor long-term prospects *relative to the S&P 500*.
*   **Beta Issues:** The negative beta raises concern, because it is outside the norm.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this data, investing in TGTX appears risky. While there are some positive aspects (revenue growth, high profit margins), the underperformance, volatility, negative expected return, and recent negative news outweigh these positives. The spikes in EPS, ROE, and equity, and the high and negative beta warrant a deeper investigation before any investment decision is made. I would advise caution.
