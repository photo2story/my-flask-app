**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** TGTX's performance has been highly volatile, with periods of significant growth (e.g., 2018-2020) followed by substantial declines (e.g., 2021-2023). This indicates a high-risk, high-reward stock.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The consistently high MDD values (ranging from 73.5% to 80.7%) highlight the significant potential for losses. Investors should be prepared for substantial price swings.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the stock's performance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). The Alpha values fluctuate widely, indicating periods of outperformance and underperformance.  The large negative Alpha values in recent periods are concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. Beta values close to 0 suggest little correlation with the market. Values of -1 or -0.1, show inverse relationship with the market.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** The market cap has varied significantly, reflecting the company's volatile performance and investor sentiment.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 31.61
*   **Last-market:** Price: 30.76, Previous Close: 31.38, Change: -1.98
*   **5-day SMA:** 32.01
*   **20-day SMA:** 31.68
*   **60-day SMA:** 33.49

**Analysis:**

*   The current price (30.76) is below both the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downward trend.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, but both are below the 60-day SMA, indicating a potential weakening of any recent upward momentum.
*   The negative change in the last market indicates continued selling pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO and Hybrid Signal**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 53.53
*   **PPO:** 0.27
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash 0%, Buy 100% of cash (32 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -105.5%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk based on this single indicator.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 53.53 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.27 suggests the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, which can be a weak bullish signal, but it is low.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 100% of cash" signal could be interpreted as an optimistic outlook, however, the MRI of 0.90 (Very Safe) associated with the signal is contradictionary.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days confirms the recent short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-105.5%) is a significant red flag. It suggests that based on current conditions, long-term investment in TGTX is projected to result in substantial losses compared to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Themes:** The news articles highlight several key themes:
    *   **Earnings and Performance:** Some articles discuss the company's Q3 2025 earnings, pointing out both positive and negative aspects. The "Earnings Caveat" headline suggests potential concerns hidden within the earnings report.
    *   **Strategic Focus:** An article questions whether TG Therapeutics is shifting its focus to neurology. This could indicate a change in the company's core strategy.
    *   **Risk Assessment:**  Several articles directly address the risks associated with investing in TGTX ("With TG Therapeutics Stock Sliding, Have You Assessed The Risk?").
    *   **Institutional Investment:** One article notes a significant stock holding by 1832 Asset Management L.P.
    *   **Growth Recognition:**  TG Therapeutics was recognized as one of North America's fastest-growing firms by Deloitte.

**Analysis:**

*   The news flow is mixed. While there's recognition of growth, there are also clear warnings about risk, scrutiny of earnings, and questions about the company's strategic direction. The emphasis on risk assessment is particularly noteworthy.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** No key reported.
*   **Mean Rating:** - (No rating provided)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 7
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 44.29 / 60.00 / 13.00

**Analysis:**

*   The lack of a consensus rating is not ideal. The wide range in target prices (from $13 to $60) highlights significant disagreement among analysts regarding the stock's potential. The average target price of $44.29 suggests potential upside, but the low target price of $13 indicates that some analysts see significant downside risk.
*   The absence of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess current analyst sentiment.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출      |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-11-05 | 2.69 | 0.16 B$   |
| 2025-08-08 | 0.19 | 0.14 B$   |
| 2025-05-09 | 0.03 | 0.12 B$   |
| 2024-11-07 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$   |
| 2025-11-05 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$   |

**Analysis:**

*   The data shows fluctuating EPS.  The most recent EPS of 2.69 is a significant outlier compared to previous quarters. This warrants further investigation to understand the source of this large increase (e.g., one-time gain, accounting adjustment, or genuine improvement in core business).
*   Revenue has shown a consistent upward trend, which is a positive sign. However, EPS is way off.
