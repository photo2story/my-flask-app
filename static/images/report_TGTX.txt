**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|-------|--------|

| 2017-2019  | 74.0%  | 74.1%  | 52.0%   | 0.0   | 1.8    |
| 2018-2020  | 316.0% | 74.1%  | 293.0%  | 0.1   | 8.3    |
| 2019-2021  | 124.0% | 74.1%  | 78.0%   | 0.3   | 3.0    |
| 2020-2022  | -71.0% | 77.8%  | -71.0%  | -0.0  | 1.9    |
| 2021-2023  | -284.0% | 77.8%  | -285.0% | -1.1  | 2.7    |
| 2022-2024  | 56.0%  | 77.8%  | 36.0%   | -1.0  | 4.8    |
| 2023-2025  | 71.0%  | 80.7%  | 4.0%    | -0.1  | 4.9    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, showing periods of strong growth (2018-2020, 2019-2021) and sharp declines (2021-2023). This indicates high volatility.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown figures (73.5% - 80.7%) confirm the stock's volatile nature and risk.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is wildly inconsistent, with massive outperformance in some periods and massive underperformance in others. This suggests that TGTX's performance is largely independent of market movements and driven by company-specific events.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are mostly close to zero or negative, especially in recent periods. This indicates that TGTX has a weak or even inverse correlation with the overall market (S&P 500). A negative beta means the stock tends to move in the opposite direction of the market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 30.77
*   **Last Market Price Details:** {'price': 30.77, 'previousClose': 31.07, 'change': -0.97}
*   **5-day SMA:** 30.934
*   **20-day SMA:** 31.076
*   **60-day SMA:** 32.701

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This *could* indicate a short-term downtrend. The last market price shows a slight decrease compared to the previous close.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.07
*   **PPO:** 0.1629
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (32 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.5 (Indicates short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -126.8% (Long-term, compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** While the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation based on its model, other factors need to be considered.
*   **RSI:**  An RSI of 50.07 is neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The PPO is slightly positive, which can indicate a slight upward momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This is a system-generated recommendation to invest all available cash, viewing the stock as "Very Safe" and suggesting monthly investments. This contrasts with the poor Expected Return.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Confirms a short-term decline, aligning with the SMA analysis.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return suggests significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, painting a concerning picture.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

**Analysis of News:**

The news headlines present a mixed picture. Strong growth and moderate buy ratings are positives. However, the articles about an "earnings caveat" and increasing competition raise concerns. The options market activity points to potential volatility, which aligns with the historical volatility seen in the Alpha/Beta analysis.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Moderate Buy
*   **Mean:** - (~-)
*   **Opinions:** 7
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 44.29 / 60.00 / 13.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Unavailable.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Moderate Buy," which suggests cautiously optimistic sentiment. The average target price ($44.29) indicates potential upside from the current price, but the wide range ($13.00 - $60.00) reflects uncertainty. The absence of recent rating changes limits the insight provided.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출        |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-11-05 | 2.69 | 0.16 B$      |
| 2025-08-08 | 0.19 | 0.14 B$      |
| 2025-05-09 | 0.03 | 0.12 B$      |

| 2025-11-05 | 0.03 | 0.08 B$      |

**Analysis:**

*   **EPS:** The EPS (Earnings Per Share) is inconsistent.  The 2025-11-05 report shows a *dramatic* increase in EPS compared to previous quarters. This single data point significantly skews the overall picture and warrants further scrutiny.  The other EPS values are relatively low.
*   **Revenue:** Revenue has been steadily increasing, indicating business growth.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

TG Therapeutics presents a complex and somewhat contradictory picture.

**Positives:**

*   **Revenue Growth:**  Consistent revenue growth is a clear positive.
*   **High Profit Margins:**  Impressively high and stable profit margins indicate efficient operations.
*   **Analyst Consensus:** Moderate Buy rating and average target price suggest some potential upside.
*   **Deloitte Fast 500:** Recognition as a fast-growing firm is a positive signal.
*   **High Investment Recommended MRI.**

**Negatives & Concerns:**

*   **Underperformance vs. S&P 500:** Significant underperformance and negative expected return compared to the market are concerning.
*   **High Volatility:**  High MDD and fluctuating CAGR indicate high risk.
*   **Negative Beta:** Indicates inverse correlation with the market.
*   **Earnings Caveat:**  Past earnings issues might indicate poor management or unrealistic expectations.
*   **Competition:**  Increased competition could threaten future growth and profitability.
*   **Inconsistent EPS:** The most recent EPS figure is a huge outlier and raises questions about its validity or sustainability.
* **Extremely negative expected return.**

**Overall Assessment:**

TGTX is a high-risk, high-reward stock. While the company shows strong revenue growth and profitability, its historical volatility, underperformance compared to the market, and the mixed news headlines suggest that significant caution is warranted. The recent spike in EPS and ROE, while seemingly positive, requires further investigation to determine if it is sustainable. The negative expected return figure is a major red flag.

**Recommendation:**

Before making any investment decision, further due diligence is crucial. Investors should carefully examine the company's financial statements, understand the drivers behind the recent EPS spike, and assess the competitive landscape. The information points to an speculative buy at best. The MRI should not be considered as valid investment advice and should be ignored.
