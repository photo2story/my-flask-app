**Analysis of Alpha, Beta and Volatility (Yearly Periods)**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|--------|---------|------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -348.0%  | 81.5%  | -357.0% | 0.0  | 1.2    |
| 2018-2020  | -692.0%  | 81.5%  | -715.0% | 0.0  | 6.8    |
| 2019-2021  | 1185.0%  | 77.3%  | 1138.0% | 0.0  | 49.3   |
| 2020-2022  | 247.0%   | 80.9%  | 248.0%  | 0.0  | 9.3    |
| 2021-2023  | 291.0%   | 80.9%  | 290.0%  | 0.1  | 22.4   |
| 2022-2024  | 14.0%    | 80.5%  | -7.0%   | 0.1  | 31.7   |
| 2023-2025  | -120.0%  | 80.7%  | -184.0% | 0.2  | 19.6   |

*   **CAGR:**  The Compounded Annual Growth Rate shows significant volatility.  Periods like 2019-2021 saw massive growth, while others (2017-2019, 2018-2020, 2023-2025) experienced substantial losses.  This highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of ADA.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high across all periods, hovering around 80%.  This indicates significant potential for losses during downturns.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha largely mirrors the CAGR, suggesting that ADA's performance is primarily driven by its inherent volatility rather than outperforming the market due to specific strategies.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally low (close to 0), which might seem counterintuitive.  In this context, with such high volatility, a low beta could mean that ADA's movements are not strongly correlated with the broader market (S&P 500).  However, given the massive swings, the correlation might be non-linear or masked by the extreme price action.  *A Beta of 0.2 for 2023-2025, might suggest a slightly stronger correlation with the S&P 500 during this period.*
*   **Cap(B):** The Market Capitalization (in Billions) indicates the company's growth (and decline) over the years.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 0.5215
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 0.5471, Previous Close: 0.5214, Change: +4.92%  **(Significantly up)** This suggests a recent positive price movement.
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 0.5812
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 0.6283
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 0.7616

**Analysis:** The price is currently *below* all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60 days). This, *in isolation*, might suggest a short-term downtrend. However, the *significant* +4.92% change in the last market suggests a potential short-term rebound.

**3. Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 26.02 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -1.04 (Below Zero)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (1625 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-01)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** -0.6 (Negative - Short Term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 2132.5% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The high MRI suggests the system believes this is a good time to invest, despite the risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI indicates the asset is oversold, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:** The PPO being negative indicates a downtrend in price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests a strong buy recommendation based on the current indicators and risk assessment.
*   **Deviation Change:** The negative change in relative deviation aligns with the price being below its moving averages and suggests recent underperformance compared to VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return (over the long term, vs. S&P 500) should be viewed with caution. Such returns are highly speculative and dependent on numerous factors.

**4. Recent News & Events**

The provided news headlines are *unrelated* to Cardano or cryptocurrency. They cover topics like Elon Musk/Tesla, new product inventions, space exploration, US Supreme Court matters, business rebranding, and veterans affairs.  These headlines do *not* provide any direct information to inform an opinion on Cardano's current or future value.

**5. Overall Summary and Conclusion**

*   **High Volatility, High Potential Reward:** Cardano has historically shown significant volatility and the potential for large gains (and losses).
*   **Recent Downturn, Potential Rebound:** Recent price action has been negative, with the price below its moving averages. However, the significant price increase in the last day suggests a potential short-term rebound might be underway. The RSI indicates that the asset is oversold.
*   **Long-Term Bullish Signal (Potentially Overoptimistic):** The MRI is high, and the system generates a strong buy signal, which could be interpreted optimistically. However, the extremely high expected return should be viewed skeptically.
*   **News Irrelevant:** Recent news headlines are unrelated to Cardano and do not contribute to the analysis.

**Recommendation (Disclaimer: Not Financial Advice):**

Given the oversold RSI and the *significant* recent price jump, a *cautious* approach might be warranted.  *If* one is already invested in Cardano, holding and observing the next few days of price action might be wise. *If* one is considering an investment, a small, speculative position *could* be considered, but only with the understanding that Cardano is a highly volatile asset with significant risk. Due to the unrelated news headlines, no change in strategy is recommended based on news factors. Always conduct thorough research and consider your own risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. The extremely high expected return should not be the primary driver of any investment decision.
