Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Cardano (ADA-USD) based on the provided data.

**0. Report in English**

Let's start with the simple numbers, then add analysis:

**1. Return Rate Comparison (ADA-USD vs. VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** ADA-USD
*   **Company:** Cardano - *A decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project.*
*   **ADA Cumulative Return:** 270.49%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 79.56%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 181.8
    *   Min: -41.0
    *   Max: 2088.2
    *   Relative Divergence: 10.5

**Analysis of Return Rate:**

ADA-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) based on cumulative return. However, the *relative divergence* of 10.5 suggests that the *current* divergence between ADA's return and VOO's is near the *bottom* end of its historical range. This implies that while ADA has outperformed, it might be experiencing a period of underperformance *relative to its own historical peaks*.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -348.0% | 81.5% | -357.0% | 0.0  | 1.1    |
| 2018-2020  | -692.0% | 81.5% | -715.0% | 0.0  | 6.3    |
| 2019-2021  | 1185.0% | 77.3% | 1138.0% | 0.0  | 45.4   |
| 2020-2022  | 247.0%  | 80.9% | 248.0%  | 0.0  | 8.6    |
| 2021-2023  | 291.0%  | 80.9% | 290.0%  | 0.1  | 20.6   |
| 2022-2024  | 14.0%   | 80.5% | -7.0%   | 0.1  | 29.3   |
| 2023-2025  | -202.0% | 80.7% | -267.0% | 0.2  | 14.9   |

**Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:**

*   **CAGR:** Highly volatile, showing huge gains in some periods and significant losses in others.  This highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of ADA.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, around 80%, indicating significant potential for loss during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** Largely mirrors the CAGR, showing the degree to which ADA outperforms or underperforms the market.
*   **Beta:** Consistently low (close to 0), indicating that ADA's price movements are *not* strongly correlated with the overall market (VOO). This suggests ADA is driven by its own specific factors rather than broad market trends. In the last two periods (2021-2023 and 2022-2024), the Beta has increased slightly, suggesting a possible, albeit small, increase in correlation with the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization in Billions, showing that ADA market cap increase dramatically in 2019-2021.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Other Indicators**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 42.64 (Neutral - not overbought or oversold)

*   The negative divergence change over the past 20 days confirms the short-term downward trend.
*   The extremely high expected return suggests significant potential upside, but should be viewed with skepticism, especially given the volatility and risk associated with ADA.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions (Consensus / Targets / Recent Changes)**

*   *Analyst Consensus: Not provided in the data.*

**5. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Cardano (ADA-USD) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, but its recent performance is weak.  The technical indicators present a mixed picture: short-term downtrend (price below SMAs, negative divergence change), neutral RSI, slightly bullish PPO, and "medium investment" according to the MRI. The Hybrid signal gives a strong buy recommendation. News sentiment is also mixed, with a focus on speculative price predictions and potential challenges.

**Key Takeaways and Considerations:**

*   **High Risk, High Reward:** ADA is clearly a high-risk investment. Its volatility (as evidenced by the large swings in CAGR and high MDD) means investors should be prepared for potentially significant losses.
*   **Independent of the Market:** The low Beta suggests ADA's price movements are largely independent of the broader market, meaning you can't rely on overall market trends to predict its performance.
*   **Short-Term Weakness:**  Technical indicators suggest a short-term downtrend.
*   **Long-Term Uncertainty:**  News articles focus on price predictions, which are not reliable indicators.
*   **Conflicting Signals:**  The hybrid model suggests a strong buy, while the recent price trend is downward, and news is mixed.
*   **Without current analyst sentiment or a clear catalyst, it's difficult to assess the true strength of the buy recommendation from the hybrid model, especially in light of the conflicting negative factors.**
