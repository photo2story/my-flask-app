### 2. Alpha, Beta Analysis & Performance Table

| Year      | CAGR       | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
| :---------- | :--------- | :----- | :------- | :--- | :----- |
| 2017-2019 | -348.0%  | 81.5% | -357.0%  | 0.0  | 1.2    |
| 2018-2020 | -692.0%  | 81.5% | -715.0%  | 0.0  | 6.5    |
| 2019-2021 | 1185.0%  | 77.3% | 1138.0%  | 0.0  | 46.9   |
| 2020-2022 | 247.0%   | 80.9% | 248.0%   | 0.0  | 8.8    |
| 2021-2023 | 291.0%   | 80.9% | 290.0%   | 0.1  | 21.3   |
| 2022-2024 | 14.0%    | 80.5% | -7.0%    | 0.1  | 30.2   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Highly volatile, with periods of extreme losses and gains. Recent years show declining growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high drawdowns indicate substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:** Largely mirrors the CAGR, suggesting that the returns are not necessarily driven by superior stock picking compared to the benchmark, except for 2022-2024 and 2023-2025.
*   **Beta:** Consistently close to 0, indicating that the return of ADA-USD is largely uncorrelated with that of the S&P 500.

**Analysis:** The provided data shows that Cardano has experienced periods of very high growth and significant drawdowns. High volatility, near-zero Beta values, and consistently negative Alpha figures indicate that Cardano's performance is highly independent from the overall market (S&P 500). This is consistent with the nature of cryptocurrencies, which can be significantly influenced by factors other than traditional market dynamics.

### 3. Recent Price Action

*   **Current Price:** 0.6429
*   **Last Market Data:** Price 0.6423, Previous Close 0.6239, Change: 2.94% (Significant daily gain)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 0.6389
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 0.7352
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 0.8162

**Analysis:** The price shows a recent jump of 2.94%. However, the current price is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend despite the recent surge.

### 4. Technical Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - **Caution:** The 'Hybrid Signal' contradicts this.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.27 (Oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.1769
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_70%_Sell 70.0% of holdings (605494 shares - Caution - MRI:0.50) (Cash Ratio: 70% on 2025-10-16)
*   **Recent Change in Relative Divergence (20-day):** -2.7 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 2069.1% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500, via dollar cost averaging)

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI indicates that Cardano is currently oversold, suggesting a potential for a price reversal.
*   The PPO being negative suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal is recommending a cautious approach, advising to sell 70% of holdings and increase cash holdings to 70%. This contradicts the MRI's "High Investment Recommended" signal.
*   The negative change in relative divergence further reinforces the potential for a short-term downtrend.
*   The "Expected Return" of 2069.1% is very high, indicating substantial potential for long-term outperformance if dollar cost averaging is applied.

### 5. Recent News & Significant Events

The news headlines are unrelated to Cardano or cryptocurrency. They are general market news. Therefore, they don't directly impact this analysis.

### 6. Analyst Opinions

*No analyst consensus data provided.*

### 7. Summary & Recommendation

**Summary:**

Cardano has shown significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500 but with substantial volatility and risk, as indicated by the high maximum drawdowns. Recent price action shows a bounce, but the price is still below key moving averages. Technical indicators are mixed, with an oversold RSI suggesting potential for a rebound, but negative divergence and PPO indicating short-term downward pressure. The news headlines are unrelated to Cardano and thus do not impact the current analysis.

**Recommendation:**

The contradictory signals make a definitive recommendation difficult. The high "Expected Return" through dollar cost averaging is appealing, but the high volatility and recent Hybrid Signal (cash_70%_Sell) suggest caution. The MRI score of 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) contradicts the Hybrid Signal that suggests caution.

**Therefore, a cautious approach is warranted:**

*   **For existing holders:** Consider partially reducing your position as per the Hybrid Signal's recommendation, especially given the high overall risk.
*   **For potential investors:** Wait for a clearer signal and further price consolidation before initiating a position. Given the large "Expected Return" through dollar cost averaging, consider investing a small amount periodically if the price drops further.
*   **Monitor closely:** Keep a close eye on price action, moving averages, and news related to Cardano and the broader cryptocurrency market.
