2025-10-05 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's an analysis of Cardano (ADA-USD) based on the data you provided.  The report is in English, includes key numbers, and offers some basic interpretations.

**Report: Cardano (ADA-USD) Analysis**

**Company Overview:** Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Cumulative Return (ADA-USD):** 662.15%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 77.46%
*   **Return Spread (ADA-USD - VOO):** 583.3
*   **Relative Spread Percentile:** 29.3 (This indicates that the current spread is in the 29.3rd percentile of its historical range).

**Analysis:** Cardano has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in cumulative returns. However, the relative spread percentile suggests the current outperformance is not at the highest level seen historically. The relative spread percentile needs to be interpreted carefully. It means that compared to VOO, ADA-USD is doing better than the past, but it's not overwhelmingly better than its historical performance against VOO.

| 2021-2023  | 291.0%    | 80.9% | 290.0%    | 0.1  | 20.9   |
| 2022-2024  | 14.0%     | 80.5% | -7.0%     | 0.1  | 29.7   |
| 2023-2025  | 190.0%    | 80.7% | 127.0%    | 0.2  | 30.1   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Varies significantly across different periods, showing high volatility.  Some periods show massive losses (-348%, -692%), while others show substantial gains (1185%, 291%).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Consistently high drawdowns around 80%, indicating significant risk and price fluctuations.
*   **Alpha:** Generally positive, suggesting outperformance relative to a benchmark, but not always (e.g., 2022-2024).
*   **Beta:** Low Beta values (close to 0) suggest ADA-USD's returns are not strongly correlated to the S&P 500 index during those time periods.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 0.8547
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 0.8390, Previous Close: 0.8663, Change: -3.15% (Decrease)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 0.8225
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 0.8546
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 0.8483

**Analysis:**  The price decreased by -3.15% in the last market session.  The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which *could* be interpreted as a short-term bearish signal. The price is hovering near the 20 and 60-day moving averages.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 44.49 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.15 (Slightly bearish, indicating short-term weakness)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" - This suggests a strong buy signal based on the hybrid strategy.
*   **20-Day Relative Spread Delta:** 2.2 (+):  Short-term increase in relative performance.
*   **Expected Return:** 1244.5% (Projected long-term outperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests that market conditions are currently favorable for investment in ADA-USD (relatively safe). The RSI is neutral. The PPO is slightly negative. The "Buy 100% of cash" signal is a strong recommendation. The large expected return suggests significant upside potential over a longer investment horizon. The recent price decrease adds some uncertainty.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **AI Startup Funding:**  News about difficulty raising money for non-AI startups might indirectly impact crypto investment flows, if investors are pulled towards AI-related investments.
*   **Green Cross Health (NZSE:GXH) shareholders loss:** Unrelated.
*   **Nicolas Cage's Engagement Ring:** Unrelated.
*   **Foley Wines Limited (NZSE:FWL):** Unrelated.
*   **AI Protester Hunger Strike:**  The end of the hunger strike may reduce any short-term negative publicity related to AI.
*   **Texas Shooting:** Unrelated.

**Analysis:** The news headlines are largely unrelated to Cardano or cryptocurrencies in general. The AI startup funding news *could* have a very indirect impact, but it's unlikely to be a major factor. The other news items appear irrelevant to ADA-USD.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   No data provided.

**5. Overall Summary**

Cardano (ADA-USD) has demonstrated substantial historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but also exhibits very high volatility. Recent price action shows a slight decrease, and technical indicators are mixed (RSI neutral, PPO slightly bearish). The MRI suggests a relatively safe investment environment, and the hybrid signal is a strong buy. The large expected return points to significant long-term potential. The news headlines are mostly unrelated, with a potential indirect impact from AI investment trends.

**Recommendation:**

While the data provides some positive signals (high MRI, strong buy signal, large expected return), the high volatility, recent price decrease, and mixed technical indicators warrant caution. The investor should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing. Further research into Cardano's specific technology, adoption, and competitive landscape is recommended.
