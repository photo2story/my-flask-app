2025-09-18 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's an analysis of Cardano (ADA-USD) based on the data you provided.  I will provide the analysis in English, with key figures highlighted at the start of each section.

**1. Performance Analysis vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** ADA-USD (Cardano)
*   **Company Overview:** Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project.
*   **ADA Cumulative Return:** 1108.22%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 83.65%
*   **Spread (Current):** 1043.4
*   **Relative Spread:** 30.2 (on scale of min/max historical spread)

**Analysis:** Cardano has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. The current spread of 1043.4 indicates a substantial difference in returns. The relative spread of 30.2 suggests that while Cardano's outperformance is significant, it is not at the highest level historically.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown of the provided Alpha/Beta data.  Note the unusual nature of the negative CAGR figures and negative Beta values.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -353.0%  | 75.4% | -368.0%  | -0.0   | 1.2    |
| 2018-2020  | -653.0%  | 75.4% | -673.0%  | -0.0   | 6.5    |
| 2019-2021  | 1450.0%  | 62.7% | 1402.0%  | -0.0   | 46.9   |
| 2020-2022  | 293.0%   | 73.7% | 290.0%   | 0.0    | 8.8    |
| 2021-2023  | 189.0%   | 73.7% | 171.0%   | 0.3    | 21.2   |
| 2022-2024  | 285.0%   | 73.7% | 260.0%   | 0.2    | 30.2   |
| 2023-2025  | 579.0%   | 73.5% | 522.0%   | 0.3    | 31.9   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR varies significantly, with extremely negative values in earlier periods (2017-2020) followed by substantial positive growth in later periods. This highlights the volatile nature of Cardano.  The more recent periods (2020 onward) show strong positive growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is consistently high, indicating significant potential losses during downturns. This reinforces the risk associated with Cardano.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally positive, indicating that Cardano has outperformed its benchmark (presumably the S&P 500, although this should be verified) after accounting for risk. However, the Alpha values mirror the CAGR, so the earlier periods show significant underperformance relative to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are close to zero in earlier periods.  Later Beta is around 0.2~0.3, suggests a low correlation with the market. Beta of 0.3 indicates that Cardano is less sensitive to market movements than the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** Market cap shows that Cardano has generally increased from 1.2B to 31.9B over the periods.

**Important Note:** The negative CAGR and Alpha figures are unusual.  It's crucial to understand the methodology used to calculate these metrics, as they might be skewed by the relatively short history of Cardano and its extreme volatility.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 0.892386794090271
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 0.8916746, 'previousClose': 0.88071394, 'change': 1.24%}
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 0.8945
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 0.8563
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 0.8405

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a short-term consolidation or slight pullback after a recent uptrend. The positive `change` in `Last-market` indicates recent upward momentum. The fact that the current price is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages is a bullish sign.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.3312 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 60.46
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.27

*   **Recent Relative Spread Change (20 days):** 0.8 (+) - Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return (%):** 1439.4

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI indicates a low-risk environment, suggesting it's a favorable time to invest.

*   **PPO:** The PPO is positive, confirming the upward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal advises a buy with 80% cash allocation, but with caution due to the MRI.
*   **Recent Relative Spread Change:** The short-term increase in the relative spread indicates Cardano is outperforming the S&P 500 in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (1439.4%) is an estimate of future outperformance relative to S&P 500 over a long term. Note, this is just an estimate and should be taken with caution.

Cardano has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, but with substantial volatility. The recent price action suggests a short-term consolidation after an uptrend. Technical indicators are mostly bullish, with the RSI approaching overbought levels. The MRI indicates a low-risk market environment.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Volatility:** Cardano is a highly volatile asset. The high MDD values in the Alpha/Beta analysis underscore this risk.
*   **Long-Term Investment:** The extremely high expected return suggests that Cardano is viewed as a potentially high-growth asset for long-term investors. However, this is just an estimation based on the historical data.
*   **Market Sentiment:** Monitor news and sentiment surrounding Cardano and the broader cryptocurrency market, as these factors can significantly impact its price.

**Recommendation (Disclaimer: This is not financial advice):**

Based on the data, Cardano presents a potentially high-reward, high-risk investment opportunity. The recent dip below the 5-day moving average could represent a buying opportunity for those with a long-term investment horizon and a high-risk tolerance. However, it's crucial to conduct thorough due diligence, monitor market sentiment, and manage risk appropriately. The very high expected return should be viewed with caution.

It is also worth noting that the negative CAGR and Alpha values from 2017-2020 are a cause for concern. The historical volatility of cryptocurrency is a very high risk that should be considered before investment.
