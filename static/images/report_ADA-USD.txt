|            | CAGR      | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|------|--------|
| 2017-2019  | -348.0%   | 81.5%  | -357.0%  | 0.0  | 1.2    |

| 2020-2022  | 247.0%    | 80.9%  | 248.0%   | 0.0  | 9.0    |
| 2021-2023  | 291.0%    | 80.9%  | 290.0%   | 0.1  | 21.6   |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows wide swings in Cardano's performance across different periods, from significant losses (-692.0%) to substantial gains (1185.0%). The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a significant loss.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, hovering around 80%, indicating significant volatility and potential for substantial losses during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is mostly mirroring the CAGR. This suggests that the performance of Cardano is not primarily driven by factors unrelated to the overall market (as measured by the benchmark).
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are very low (close to 0), indicating that Cardano's price movements have had very little correlation with the overall market (represented by the S&P 500). In other words, the volatility is independent of the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Cap(B) fluctuates, reflecting market capitalization.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Analysis:** The current close price (0.3507) is below all three Simple Moving Averages (5-day, 20-day, 60-day), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The negative change in the "Last-market" data confirms this recent downward pressure.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A Market Risk Indicator of 0.7 suggests a medium investment recommendation.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 28.73 indicates that Cardano is currently in oversold territory, which *could* suggest a potential for a price rebound. *However, oversold conditions can persist for extended periods during strong downtrends.*
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-0.71) further supports the notion of a short-term downtrend.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days (-2.3) corroborates the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally high expected return (6647.6%) is very optimistic. This figure requires critical examination of the methodology used to calculate it. Such extremely high projected returns are often based on assumptions that may not hold true.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal recommends buying 100% of available cash, suggesting a very safe investment based on an MRI of 0.90. It suggests a monthly investment of 1% of total investment.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance):**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news headlines present a mixed outlook for Cardano. Some articles predict significant price increases (e.g., "Cardano (ADA) All Set for a 10x Rally to $10"), while others question its future ("Now That Cardano is Dead, What’s The Next Big Thing?").
*   **Price Predictions:** Several articles focus on price predictions, suggesting uncertainty and speculation surrounding Cardano's future value.
*   **Bearish Signals:** Articles mentioning "bearish signals" indicate potential headwinds for Cardano's price.
*   **Market Correlation:** The article about Bitcoin's decline and its impact on crypto stocks suggests that Cardano is not immune to broader market trends in the cryptocurrency space.
*   **Whale Activity:** The article about whales backing a rebound suggests that large investors may be influencing price movements.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Summary:** Cardano has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, but current indicators suggest a short-term downtrend.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The technical indicators (RSI, PPO) paint a mixed picture. While the RSI indicates oversold conditions, the PPO confirms the downtrend.  The analyst consensus is not available.
*   **Volatility:** Cardano exhibits very high volatility, as reflected by its high Maximum Drawdown and the wide swings in its CAGR across different periods. The extremely high expected return is highly speculative and may be unrealistic.
*   **News Sentiment:** The news headlines present a conflicting outlook, with both optimistic price predictions and concerns about Cardano's future.  The headlines, taken as a whole, reflect the high level of speculation and uncertainty surrounding Cardano.
*   **Recommendation:** *Based on the data and recent news, a cautious approach to investing in Cardano is warranted.* While the oversold RSI and the Hybrid Signal might suggest a potential buying opportunity, the downtrend confirmed by the price action, moving averages, PPO, and recent divergence change indicate that the price could fall further. The high volatility and mixed news sentiment further amplify the risks.  **Before investing, conduct thorough independent research and consider your own risk tolerance.**  Pay close attention to market capitalization (Cap(B)) for future investment.
