## Cardano (ADA-USD) Analysis

**Company Overview:** Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **ADA Cumulative Return:** 1126.45%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 83.07%
*   **Spread:**

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|------|--------|

| 2019-2021  | 1450.0%  | 62.7% | 1402.0%  | -0.0 | 46.1   |
| 2020-2022  | 293.0%   | 73.7% | 290.0%   | 0.0  | 8.7    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows highly volatile performance, with significant negative returns in early periods and explosive growth in later periods.  The most recent periods (2020-2025) show strong positive CAGRs.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant risk and price volatility in Cardano.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is generally very high and positive in recent periods, demonstrating significant outperformance relative to a benchmark.  However, the earlier periods show substantial negative alpha.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are low (close to zero), which is unusual. Typically, you'd expect a Beta with a cryptocurrency relative to a market index to have a beta of 1 or higher. It suggests ADA's returns are not strongly correlated to broad market movements (like the S&P 500). *However, a beta of zero could also be the result of missing data or methodology issues.*
*   **Cap(B):**  Market Cap fluctuates considerably, reflecting the volatile nature of cryptocurrency valuations.

*   **5-day Moving Average:** 0.9063
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 0.8532
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 0.8377

**Analysis:**

*   The price has fallen -4.24% based on the last market data.
*   The price is trading slightly below its 5-day moving average but above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a short-term pullback within a broader uptrend.

*   **RSI:** 69.41 (Approaching Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.9525
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (78 shares - Safe - MRI:0.32) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-14)
*   **20-day Relative Spread Change:** 0.8 (Positive - Short-Term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 1439.4% (Long-Term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The low MRI suggests relatively low market risk at the moment.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is approaching overbought territory, which could signal a potential pullback or consolidation.
*   **PPO:** The Positive PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) shows a uptrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The trading signal recommends using 90% of cash to buy ADA, suggesting a bullish outlook. The "Safe" designation and low MRI reinforce the risk assessment.
*   **Relative Spread:** The increase in the relative spread over the last 20 days indicates short-term outperformance against the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return suggests significant potential upside over a long-term investment horizon, relative to the S&P 500.

The recent -4.24% price change suggests a short-term dip, but the overall technical picture remains generally positive.
