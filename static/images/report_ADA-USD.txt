2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the provided data for Cardano (ADA-USD), comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Analysis**

*   **Ticker:** ADA-USD
*   **Company Name:** Cardano
*   **Overview:** Cardano is a decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project and is fully open source.
*   **Cumulative Return (ADA-USD):** 215.64%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 73.30%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: 119.0
    *   Relative Divergence: 7.5

**Analysis of Return:** Cardano has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative return. The current divergence of 119.0, with a relative divergence of only 7.5, indicates that while Cardano has achieved a much larger cumulative return, its recent performance relative to its historical fluctuation range has been closer to the lower end of the spectrum. This suggests that a large part of the outperformance may have occurred earlier in the measured timeframe.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha     | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| 2018-2020  | -692.0%  | 100.0% | -712.0%   | 1.0  | 6.5    |
| 2019-2021  | 1185.0%  | 99.8%  | 1142.0%   | 1.2  | 47.1   |
| 2020-2022  | 247.0%   | 92.8%  | 249.0%    | 1.5  | 8.9    |
| 2021-2023  | 291.0%   | 87.6%  | 290.0%    | 1.9  | 21.4   |
| 2022-2024  | 14.0%    | 72.5%  | -6.0%     | 1.7  | 30.3   |
| 2023-2025  | -280.0%  | 86.1%  | -342.0%   | 1.6  | 12.0   |

**Analysis of Table Data:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate shows extreme volatility. While there have been periods of very high growth (e.g., 1185.0% from 2019-2021), there have also been significant declines (e.g., -692.0% from 2018-2020, -280.0% from 2023-2025).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and large potential losses.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha value, representing excess return relative to a benchmark, mirrors the volatility of the CAGR, with large positive and negative swings.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally above 1, indicating that Cardano's price tends to be more volatile than the overall market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** The Beta CAPM suggests an outperforming return is needed to compensate the risk.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 0.36195
*   **Last-market:** `{'price': 0.36195, 'previousClose': 0.35619, 'change': 1.62}`
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.3484
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.3633
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.4315

**Analysis of Fluctuations:** The current price is slightly below the 20-day SMA but above the 5-day SMA, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend. However, the 60-day SMA is significantly higher, indicating a longer-term downtrend or correction. The Last-market data indicates a slight positive change in the most recent trading session.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 44.58
*   **PPO:** 0.4931
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2899 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -1.1 (단기하락) - short-term decline
*   **Expected Return (%):** 6340.68

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the volatility, the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation. This is surprising given the other data, and might be an outlier. The user should double-check the MRI settings and how the MRI has been calculated to make an informed decision.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 44.58 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The PPO value of 0.4931 is close to zero, which means the shorter-term moving average is nearly crossing over (or has crossed over) the longer-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal indicates a strong buy signal based on the models used to generate it, suggesting investing all available cash and reinvesting 1% of the total value each month. The model is indicating high safety with an MRI of 0.90.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence (-1.1) suggests that the short-term performance has been lagging compared to the broader market or historical performance, further solidifying the recent downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (6340.68%) should be viewed with significant skepticism. It likely represents an optimistic scenario based on specific model assumptions and might not reflect realistic market conditions. This requires further investigation.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes:**
    *   **Price Predictions:** A significant amount of news focuses on price predictions for Cardano in 2025, 2026, and beyond, with some articles speculating on ADA reaching $2.
    *   **Technical Analysis & Resistance:** News articles discuss resistance levels and the potential for corrections in the ADA price.
    *   **Network Catalysts:** One article mentions potential catalysts for the Cardano network.
    *   **Glacier Drop:** Information about the Glacier Drop rollout suggests updates to the network are occurring.

**Analysis of News:** The news sentiment is mixed. While there is optimism about future price appreciation, there are also concerns about potential corrections and resistance levels. The presence of network catalyst discussions and updates (Glacier Drop) indicates ongoing development and potential positive drivers for the future.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   No specific analyst consensus or targets were provided.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis & Summary**

Overall, the analysis paints a picture of a high-growth, high-risk asset. Cardano has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, but its recent performance has been weaker. The indicators are mixed, with a high MRI but a declining relative divergence. News sentiment is also mixed, with optimistic price predictions offset by concerns about corrections and resistance.

**Key Considerations & Recommendations:**

*   **High Risk:** The high Beta and Maximum Drawdown highlight the significant risk associated with Cardano.
*   **Recent Weakness:** The recent decline in relative divergence and the price action relative to the 60-day SMA suggest caution in the short term.
*   **Skepticism towards Expected Returns:** The extremely high expected return is likely unrealistic and should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.
*   **Due Diligence:** Further research is recommended before investing, especially regarding the MRI calculation, analyst consensus (if available), and the assumptions behind the expected return figure.
*   **Consider Diversification:** Given the high risk, it's crucial to diversify your portfolio and not allocate an excessive portion to Cardano.

**In summary:** Cardano presents a high-risk, potentially high-reward opportunity. While historical performance has been strong, recent performance suggests caution. A thorough understanding of the risks and ongoing developments is crucial before making any investment decisions.
