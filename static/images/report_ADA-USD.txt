**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 0.782095
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 0.781354

    *   20-Day MA: 0.8365
    *   60-Day MA: 0.855

*Analysis:* The recent price action indicates a short-term downward trend. The price has fallen below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), and the 4.2% drop from the previous close is a notable negative signal.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 43.44 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.26 (Slightly negative, suggesting a potential weakening of the upward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (1188 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)" This aggressive signal suggests the algorithm is bullish.
*   **20-Day Relative Spread Change:** -1.3 (Negative, indicating short-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500)
*   **Expected Return:** 1330.8% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500).

*Analysis:* The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation. However, the recent negative price action, slightly negative PPO, and negative change in relative spread suggest caution. The RSI is neutral. The high expected return indicates potential long-term outperformance, but it should be viewed with skepticism given the high volatility.

Cardano has demonstrated substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the past. However, the recent price action is concerning, with a significant drop and the price falling below key moving averages.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted.

*   **Existing holders:** Consider holding existing positions, but be aware of the potential for further downside.
*   **Potential investors:** Wait for a more stable price trend and positive momentum before initiating a new position. The recent price drop and negative signals warrant caution.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Cardano remains a high-risk, high-reward investment. Only allocate capital that you are prepared to lose. The high MDD figures in the historical performance analysis underscore this risk.
