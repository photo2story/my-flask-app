## Cardano (ADA-USD) Analysis

**Company Overview:** Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform aiming to provide a more secure, scalable, and energy-efficient alternative to proof-of-work networks.

### 1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)

**Numbers:**

*   **ADA-USD Cumulative Return:** 467.96%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 76.04%
*   **Spread (ADA-USD - VOO):**
    *   **Max:** 2088.2
    *   **Min:** -41.0
    *   **Current:** 448.5
    *   **Relative Spread:** 23.0

**Analysis:**

Cardano has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period considered. The current cumulative return difference is substantial (448.5%).  However, the relative spread of 23.0 indicates that the current outperformance is closer to the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests that while Cardano has performed well, its current outperformance is not as extreme as it has been in the past.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2023-2025  | -4.0%   | 80.7% | -66.0%  | 0.2  | 22.5   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate shows very volatile performance, with large negative returns in early periods and substantial positive returns in others. Recent years have shown declining or slightly negative CAGR.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values largely mirror the CAGR, showing significant periods of outperformance followed by underperformance.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are consistently low (close to 0), suggesting that Cardano's price movements have had very little correlation with the S&P 500, which suggests that it is insensitive to market movements and has less systematic risk.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has grown over time, indicating increasing adoption and investment. However, market cap is very volatile, which confirms that Cardano is a high-risk asset.

### 2. Recent Price Action

The negative change in the last market data (-0.91%) confirms this recent downward pressure. The gap between the current price and the 20 and 60-day moving averages suggests further potential for decline if the trend continues.
