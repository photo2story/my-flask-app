2025-10-17 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's an analysis of Cardano (ADA-USD) based on the data you provided.  The report will be in English with a focus on key numbers and their interpretation.

**Cardano (ADA-USD) Analysis**

**0. Overview**

Cardano is a blockchain platform that aims to provide a more secure and scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Cumulative Return (ADA-USD):** 523.95%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 75.41%
*   **Absolute Divergence (Current):** 519.4
*   **Relative Divergence (Current):** 26.3

**Analysis:**  ADA-USD has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in terms of cumulative return. However, the *relative divergence* of 26.3 indicates that the current outperformance is closer to the lower end of its historical range compared to VOO.  This suggests that while ADA has been a strong performer, its current relative position isn't as extreme as it has been in the past.

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) demonstrates very high volatility, with periods of extreme negative returns followed by periods of substantial growth.  More recent periods show positive but reduced growth compared to the 2019-2021 boom.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) consistently hovers around 80%, indicating significant downside risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is largely positive in high-growth periods, indicating outperformance.  Negative alpha in recent years suggests underperformance relative to the benchmark during those periods.
*   **Beta:** The Beta is consistently low, suggesting ADA-USD has a low correlation with the overall market (VOO).

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 0.6997
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 0.6434, Previous Close: 0.6688, Change: -3.79%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 0.7081
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 0.7943
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 0.8481

**Analysis:** The recent market data shows a price decrease of -3.79%. The current price is below all moving averages (5, 20, and 60 day), indicating a short-term downward trend.  The fact that the 5-day moving average is below the 20-day and 60-day reinforces this bearish signal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 41.61
*   **PPO:** -1.78
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -3.1 (downward)
*   **Expected Return:** 1454.0%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A MRI of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, reflecting a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 41.61 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions, but is trending towards oversold.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-1.78) suggests a downward trend in price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy" signal indicates an optimistic outlook, seemingly contradicting some of the other indicators.  However, the signal also incorporates the MRI of 0.90, suggesting a more conservative "Very Safe" approach.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence (-3.1) confirms the recent underperformance versus the benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return (1454.0%) should be viewed with caution. It represents a *potential* long-term outperformance against the S&P 500 based on historical data and modeling, but cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and such projections are inherently uncertain.

**4. Recent News & Events**

*   **[2025-10-16] Top Cryptocurrencies Fall; Bitcoin Hovers Above $108,000 (MT Newswires)**

**Analysis:** This headline indicates a general downturn in the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin is mentioned specifically, a broader market decline likely impacts Cardano as well.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   No analyst consensus data was provided.

**5. Overall Summary**

Cardano (ADA-USD) has historically delivered significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), but recent performance has been weaker.  The current price is below its short and medium-term moving averages, and the technical indicators (PPO, Change in Relative Divergence) point to a short-term downward trend.  While the MRI suggests a medium investment risk and the Hybrid Signal indicates a "Buy", this signal is conservative. The recent news headline indicates a general downturn in the crypto market, adding further caution.

The extremely high "Expected Return" should be considered a highly speculative estimate. While Cardano may have the potential for long-term growth, the cryptocurrency market is inherently risky.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is warranted.  Given the recent price weakness, negative momentum indicators, and the overall market uncertainty, consider the following:

*   **If already holding ADA-USD:** Be prepared for further potential downside.  Consider setting stop-loss orders to protect profits or limit losses.
*   **If considering a new position:**  Exercise caution and consider waiting for a more favorable entry point.  The current downward trend suggests that prices may decline further.  Allocate only a small portion of your portfolio to this investment, given its high risk profile.
