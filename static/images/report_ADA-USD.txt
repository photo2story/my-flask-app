**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta  | Cap(B) |
| ---------- | --------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | ------ |
| 2017-2019  | -348.0% | 81.5% | -357.0% | 0.0 | 1.2 |
| 2018-2020  | -692.0% | 81.5% | -715.0% | 0.0 | 6.5 |
| 2019-2021  | 1185.0% | 77.3% | 1138.0% | 0.1 | 47.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 247.0% | 80.9% | 248.0% | 0.1 | 8.8 |
| 2021-2023  | 291.0% | 80.9% | 290.0% | 0.1 | 21.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 14.0%   | 80.5% | -7.0%  | 0.1 | 30.3 |
| 2023-2025  | -217.0%  | 80.7% | -274.0% | 0.2 | 14.7 |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Very volatile.  Extremely high growth in some periods (2019-2021) contrasts with significant declines in others (2017-2019, 2018-2020, 2023-2025). This highlights the high-risk, high-reward nature of ADA.

*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high drawdowns around 80% indicate significant potential losses during downturns.

*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values mostly mirror the CAGR, showing strong outperformance in positive periods and underperformance in negative ones.  This suggests ADA's returns are largely independent of broad market movements.

*   **Beta:** Low Beta values (0.0-0.2) suggest ADA's price is not strongly correlated with the S&P 500.  This means ADA's price moves are largely independent of the broader market.

*   **Cap(B):** The Capitalization shows the market cap of ADA-USD in billions.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 0.4097
*   **Previous Close:** 0.4046
*   **Change:** 1.26%

*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 0.4216
    *   20-day SMA: 0.5072
    *   60-day SMA: 0.6514

*   **Analysis:** The price is currently below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day). This generally indicates a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA being the closest to the current price suggests a recent slight upward movement, but still needs to surpass the 20 and 60 day averages to confirm a bullish trend.

**3) Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 19.36
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -2.04
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.7 (-): 단기하락
*   **Expected Return (%):** 5026.1%

*   **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI:** A MRI of 0.8 indicates a "Medium Investment" recommendation.

    *   **RSI:** The RSI of 19.36 is extremely low, indicating oversold conditions. This *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, as the asset may be undervalued and due for a rebound.

    *   **PPO:** A negative PPO value (-2.04) suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a bearish trend.

    *   **Hybrid Signal:**  The hybrid signal recommends buying 100% with cash, which suggests that the system sees value in Cardano at this price point, combined with a good MRI score.

    *   **Recent Divergence Change:**  A negative change in relative divergence (-2.7) confirms the short-term downward trend.

    *   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return (5026.1%) is an extremely optimistic projection, and investors should be very cautious about relying on such a large figure. It could be based on specific model assumptions or overly optimistic forecasts.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** The news headlines paint a mixed-to-negative picture. Terms like "correction risk," "Cardano is Dead," and questions about whether ADA can "Hold Key Support or Slide Toward $0.60?" reflect concerns about the cryptocurrency's current state.

*   **Potential Catalysts:** One article mentions Cardano having a "Catalyst?" suggesting there may be some positive developments or events that could boost the price. Another positive note is a "Nasdaq-Listed Company Completes First Cardano Buy," showing institutional interest.

*   **Price Predictions:** Several articles focus on price predictions, which are inherently speculative and should be viewed with skepticism.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Overall Assessment:** Cardano presents a complex picture. The historical data reveals high volatility and periods of both extreme growth and significant decline. While the cumulative return has outperformed the S&P 500, the recent trend is bearish, as indicated by the price being below moving averages, a negative PPO, and a recent negative divergence change. The RSI suggests oversold conditions, which *could* lead to a rebound.

*   **News Sentiment:** Recent news is mixed, with both positive and negative headlines. The negative sentiment surrounding potential corrections and concerns about price support levels cannot be ignored. However, the institutional buy provides a glimmer of optimism.

*   **Investment Recommendation:** Based on the data provided, a cautious approach is warranted.

    *   **Potential Upside:**  The oversold RSI, Hybrid Signal, and extremely high expected return suggest the possibility of a significant rebound.
    *   **Significant Risks:**  High volatility, large drawdowns, negative news sentiment, and the current downtrend pose substantial risks.

    *   **Ultimately, any investment in Cardano should be made with a clear understanding of the risks involved and should be considered a speculative investment.**
