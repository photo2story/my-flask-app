**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications and smart contracts.
*   **ADA Cumulative Return:** 202.15%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 78.07%
*   **Divergence:** 124.1
*   **Relative Divergence:** 7.8
*   **Analysis:** Cardano has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative return. However, the relative divergence of 7.8 indicates that the current outperformance is near the lower end of its historical fluctuation range compared to the S\&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table:**

|            Year |    CAGR |   MDD |   Alpha |   Beta |   Cap(B) |
|-----------------|---------|-------|--------|--------|---------|
|       2017-2019 |  -348% | 81.5% | -357% |    0.0 |     1.2 |
|       2018-2020 |  -692% | 81.5% | -715% |    0.0 |     6.6 |
|       2019-2021 | 1185% | 77.3% | 1138% |    0.0 |    47.6 |
|       2020-2022 |   247% | 80.9% |  248% |    0.0 |     9.0 |
|       2021-2023 |   291% | 80.9% |  290% |    0.1 |    21.6 |
|       2022-2024 |    14% | 80.5% |   -7% |    0.1 |    30.7 |
|       2023-2025 |  -270% | 80.7% | -334% |    0.2 |    12.8 |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows extremely volatile performance over different periods, with periods of massive losses followed by periods of significant gains.  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a significant negative CAGR.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and price volatility.  Drawdowns of around 80% are characteristic of a highly speculative asset.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is a measure of outperformance relative to a benchmark. Here, the Alpha roughly mirrors the CAGR, but is negative in periods of underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta is consistently low. A Beta near 0 indicates very low correlation to the overall market (e.g., S&P 500).  This suggests ADA's price movements are largely independent of broader market trends. This is not inherently good or bad, but it means ADA is likely driven by factors specific to cryptocurrency and the Cardano project itself.
*   **Cap(B):** This is the Market Cap in Billions.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 0.3507
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 0.3548, Previous Close: 0.3665, Change: -3.19%
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.3803
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.4134
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.5023
*   **Analysis:** The price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), indicating a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA, further confirming the downward trend. The last market data showing a price decrease of -3.19% reinforces this.

**3) RSI, PPO Index Indicators, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 28.73
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.71
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2579 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.3 (단기하락 - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 6647.6%
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The RSI of 28.73 indicates that Cardano is currently oversold, which can sometimes precede a price bounce.
    *   The negative PPO suggests a downtrend in momentum.
    *   The Hybrid Signal seems to contradict other indicators by recommending a strong buy, with a higher MRI reading of 0.9, and suggesting that the investment is "very safe". This could be a long-term, value-based recommendation.
    *   The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent short-term decline.
    *   The high "Expected Return" should be viewed with extreme skepticism. Such high returns are unlikely and might be based on overly optimistic models. The expected return is significantly higher than those of VOO.
    *   The market risk indicator is medium.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance):**

*   **Positive Sentiment:**
    *   "Cardano Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will ADA Price Hit $2?" implies potential future growth.
    *   "Whales and Retail Back Cardano (ADA) Price Rebound Despite Bearish Signals" suggests support from key investor groups even during downturns.

*   **Mixed Sentiment:**
    *   "Bitcoin falls back to below $90K, set for weekly loss; crypto stocks slide" This indicates the Cardano also fluctuates with the Crypto market.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Cardano (ADA-USD) presents a mixed picture. While it has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, it also exhibits high volatility and periods of substantial drawdowns. The recent price action indicates a short-term downtrend, with the price below key moving averages and a negative change in relative divergence.

**In summary:**

*   **High Risk, High Potential Reward:** Cardano is a high-risk, speculative asset with the *potential* for significant returns, but also the *risk* of substantial losses.
*   **Recent Downtrend:** Recent price indicators suggest a short-term downtrend is currently in effect.
*   **Market Sentiment:** Recent news is mixed. Optimistic predictions compete with serious questioning of Cardano's prospects.
*   **Oversold Condition:** The RSI suggests the asset is oversold, which could lead to a short-term bounce.
*   **Long-Term vs. Short-Term:** The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a value-based long-term buy, while short-term indicators are mostly negative.
