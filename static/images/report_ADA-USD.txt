**Comprehensive Analysis**

Based on the provided data and news, Cardano's return rate is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500, indicating a high level of risk. The company's price fluctuations show a recent sharp decline, with the 20-day moving average being lower than the close price. The indicators suggest a medium risk investment, with an improving delta and a high expected return. However, the risk is still present due to the high PPO value. The recent news suggests that Cardano is facing significant challenges, including a 50% correction risk. Overall, the stock appears to be risky and the investment should be carefully considered.
