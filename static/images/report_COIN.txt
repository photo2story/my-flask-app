## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a cryptocurrency exchange platform.  As of the last data point provided, COIN's cumulative return is 157.39%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 43.34% return. The difference is 114.05%.  The provided relative divergence of 71.5% indicates that COIN's performance is at the higher end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  However, the high relative divergence should be considered in context with the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures suggest strong growth, but also high maximum drawdown (MDD) indicating significant risk.  Beta values significantly higher than 1 suggest higher volatility than the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $278.71
* **Last Market Price:** $279.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $291.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $306.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $250.41

The stock is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential longer-term support.  The difference between the last market price and the closing price is negligible.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -17.2% – Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 55.1% – This represents a significant projected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term, contingent on the provided data.  This should be viewed cautiously given the inherent volatility.  A price of $279.62 does not suggest any immediate extreme price movements (sharp jump or drop).

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase (COIN) shows strong cumulative returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500, however, this is coupled with high volatility and significant drawdowns.  Recent price action indicates a short-term bearish trend. Technical indicators suggest the stock may be approaching oversold conditions, but further confirmation is needed.  Earnings data reveals considerable volatility and inconsistency, with substantial fluctuations in both revenue and EPS. Financial statements display inconsistency in profitability and return on equity.  The projected long-term outperformance (55.1%) should be viewed with caution, given the market's volatility and the absence of relevant context.  Crucially, missing information on recent news and analyst sentiment prevents a comprehensive assessment of the current market outlook for COIN.  More data is needed for a conclusive evaluation.
