**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $281.14
* **Last Market Price:** $283.26
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $264.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $269.86
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $272.89

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend in the short to medium term.  The difference between the last market price and the closing price is minimal.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.55  (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.27 (Positive; suggests bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +8.1% (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.4% (relative to S&P 500)

The technical indicators suggest a relatively neutral to slightly bullish outlook. However, the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a crucial factor to consider for long-term investors.  The last market price of $283.26 being slightly higher than the closing price doesn't suggest any significant immediate price jump or drop.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has demonstrated strong growth and profitability relative to the S&P 500.  The company's consistent beating of earnings expectations is encouraging. However, the projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-3.4%) along with the volatile ROE warrants caution.  Investors should carefully consider the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments and the company's dependence on the cryptocurrency market's overall performance. The relatively high beta (71.0) confirms this volatility.  Further due diligence, including an analysis of market trends and regulatory risks within the cryptocurrency space, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
