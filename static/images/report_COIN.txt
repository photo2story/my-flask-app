## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.

| Metric                     | COIN    | VOO     | Difference | Relative Difference |
|--------------------------|---------|---------|------------|----------------------|
| Cumulative Return (%)      | 145.45  | 47.74   | 97.71      | 85.53%               |


COIN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period considered, with a cumulative return almost triple that of VOO.  However, it is important to note that the high relative difference is influenced by the historical volatility of COIN. The relative difference represents the percentile rank relative to the historical range of differences, not a direct measure of outperformance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD (%) | Alpha | Beta | Cap (B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|------|---------|
| 2021-2023  | -47.0%  | 76.7    | -82.0% | 2.8  | 35.6    |
| 2022-2024  | 17.6%   | 70.5    | -12.0% | 3.0  | 65.6    |

The high Beta values indicate COIN's high sensitivity to market movements, while the negative alpha values in 2021-2023 suggest underperformance relative to the market.  Positive alpha in 2022-2024 shows a period of outperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

| Metric           | Value    |
|--------------------|----------|
| Closing Price     | $295.23  |
| Last Market Price | $301.59  |
| 5-Day MA         | $314.21  |
| 20-Day MA        | $257.68  |
| 60-Day MA        | $203.54  |

The price is below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend.  However, it's above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential support levels.  The gap between the last market price and the closing price suggests potential volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (71.32):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70), suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.85):** Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (34.85, +):** Shows a recent increase in relative strength, indicating potential short-term upward movement.

Considering the last market price of $301.59 is higher than the closing price, this reflects a potential intraday bounce or short-term upward pressure.  However, the RSI nearing overbought levels cautions against significant further immediate upside.

* **Expected Return (0.22%):** This represents a modest expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This requires careful consideration alongside other risk factors.
