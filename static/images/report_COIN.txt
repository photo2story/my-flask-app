**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. The substantial difference reflects COIN's strong performance, likely driven by increased cryptocurrency market activity and Coinbase's market position.  However, the relative divergence indicates that this outperformance is relatively high compared to historical performance against the S&P 500, suggesting possible overvaluation or increased risk. The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data also shows high growth but high maximum drawdown (MDD).  The high beta values (43.5-68.8) show high sensitivity to market movements.  Alpha values suggest that, despite significant returns,  COIN's performance isn't entirely independent of market movements, especially in earlier periods.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 91.0% | -0.0 | 43.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 127.0% | 0.0 | 62.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 193.0% | 24.9% | 135.0% | 0.1 | 68.8 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The recent price increase (2.99$) from the previous close might signal a temporary rebound, but further observation is needed to confirm this.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 40.17 is near the oversold territory (below 30), potentially suggesting a buying opportunity. However, the negative PPO (-0.61) indicates bearish momentum.  The positive change in relative divergence (0.1) over the past 20 days shows a short-term upward trend, but it's contradicted by the negative PPO and the price being below its moving averages. The expected return of -2.3% suggests underperformance relative to the S&P 500, even considering a long-term (2+ years) investment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There's a substantial increase in EPS and revenue in Q2 2024, followed by a sharp decrease in Q3 2024. The erratic nature of the data makes a simple conclusion difficult and might warrant more detailed examination of underlying factors.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3 | 1.21 B$ |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15 | 1.45 B$ |
| 2024-05-02 | 4.84 | 1.64 B$ |
| 2023-11-02 | -0.01 | 0.67 B$ |
| 2024-10-30 | -0.01 | 0.67 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has generally declined in the most recent period, although profit margins remain relatively high.  ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates significantly, indicating inconsistent profitability.  Further investigation into the causes of these fluctuations is necessary.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13% |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.67B | 61.01% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |

| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has shown impressive returns exceeding the S&P 500, driven by its position in the growing cryptocurrency market.  However, the high beta suggests significant market risk, and the recent price action indicates potential short-term weakness.  The mixed signals from technical indicators (RSI, PPO) and the volatile earnings and financial data necessitate cautious interpretation.  While the long-term potential remains linked to cryptocurrency adoption, the current market conditions and financial performance uncertainty warrant a careful assessment before investment.  Further due diligence, including a deeper analysis of the cryptocurrency market trends and Coinbase's competitive landscape, is crucial for informed decision-making.
