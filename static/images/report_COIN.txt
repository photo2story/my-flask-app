## Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) Investment Report

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  Over the reviewed period, COIN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 156.43%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 42.95%
* **Return Difference:** 113.5%
* **Relative Outperformance:** 76.0% (This means COIN's outperformance relative to VOO falls into the 76th percentile of its historical range of outperformance. It's not a statement of future performance).
* **CAGR (2021-2025):** 156.0%  This shows substantial growth, though it's crucial to consider the high volatility.
* **Alpha:** 113.0% (positive alpha indicates superior risk-adjusted return compared to the benchmark).
* **Beta:** 70.0 (High beta signifies high volatility and correlation with the market.  COIN's price movements will likely be more extreme than the overall market.)


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $281.14
* **Last Market Price:** $280.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $264.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $269.86
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $272.89

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend, but this is relatively close to the averages, implying a potential for consolidation or correction.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +8.1% (Positive, suggesting short-term upward momentum).
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.4% (This suggests that, while COIN has significantly outperformed VOO historically, long-term expectations relative to the S&P 500 are currently negative).  This is an important caveat to the strong historical performance.

The Last-market price of $280.64 is close to the closing price, indicating a relatively stable market at the time of reporting.  There is no evidence of a recent sharp uptrend or downturn.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility and inconsistencies.  Revenue is generally high but fluctuating, and EPS is highly erratic, moving between significant profits and losses, even between consecutive quarters.  This highlights significant risk associated with COIN.  Further investigation into the underlying drivers of this volatility is warranted.  More data points are needed for a definitive trend analysis.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue has shown a general downward trend from Q1 2024, though some fluctuations exist.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are generally high, but they show some decline in recent quarters, particularly in Q3 2023.
* **Equity:**  Equity has generally been increasing but with variability.
* **ROE:**  Return on Equity has been quite volatile, ranging from significant positive returns to negative returns, implying inconsistency in profitability and utilization of shareholder investments.

The financial information indicates instability, highlighting a need for cautious assessment of the companyâ€™s financial health and future prospects.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has demonstrated extraordinary growth compared to the S&P 500 historically, but this growth has been coupled with high volatility. Recent price action shows a near-term upward trend, but technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly positive outlook, but not overwhelmingly bullish. Earnings and financial information reveal substantial variability and some cause for concern regarding financial stability.  The projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is a key factor to consider.  Investors should be aware of the substantial risk involved with COIN due to its high volatility and the uncertainty surrounding the cryptocurrency market as a whole.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the drivers of revenue and profit fluctuations, is necessary before making any investment decisions.
