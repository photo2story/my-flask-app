## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return of COIN (187.75%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 47.47% over the analyzed period.  The difference is 140.3%, placing it at the 87.7th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500.  This indicates COIN has historically shown a high degree of outperformance compared to the broader market, although this is not a guarantee of future performance.  The Alpha and Beta analysis show high volatility and significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the periods analyzed.  However, the negative Alpha in 2021-2023 suggests that after accounting for market risk (Beta), the investment underperformed expectations.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last 2 days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this is not indicative of future performance.  Recent price action suggests some short-term weakness but a longer-term upward trend is possible.  Earnings have shown significant volatility, and while profit margins are generally high,  consistent revenue and EPS growth is not evident.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy may be suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance, given the expected excess return. However, thorough due diligence, considering the volatility and lack of consistent earnings growth, is crucial before making any investment decision.  More information on recent news and analyst opinions would significantly improve the overall assessment.
