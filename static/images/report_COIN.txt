**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a cryptocurrency exchange platform providing a variety of services for buying, selling, and trading digital assets.

The cumulative return of COIN is 169.49%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 44.89%.  The difference is 124.6%, placing it at the 80.8th percentile of its historical divergence from the S&P 500 based on the provided data (max: 168.3, min: -59.7).  This indicates a substantial outperformance relative to the market's historical performance.  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant growth, ranging from 86% to 238% across different periods.  However, the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values (43.5% to 70.4%) highlight substantial risk involved in investing in COIN. The alpha consistently being close to zero suggests COIN's returns are largely explained by market movements (high beta of 74).

* **5-day Moving Average:** $271.72
* **20-day Moving Average:** $269.08
* **60-day Moving Average:** $274.26

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend.  However, the relatively small difference between the averages indicates a less pronounced trend and potential volatility.  The recent price change of +4.92% from the previous close signals a recent positive price movement.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +11.9 – Shows a recent increase in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -2.9% – This indicates a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This is a significant finding and deserves further scrutiny of the underlying assumptions in this estimate.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There are instances of high EPS ($4.84 in Q1 2024) and periods with negative EPS. Revenue has generally been increasing, though the last two quarters show a decline.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers behind this volatility and the inconsistency in profitability.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown substantial growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, this performance comes with significant volatility and risk, as indicated by the high MDD and inconsistent earnings. The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  While short-term indicators suggest a potential uptrend, a comprehensive due diligence including a thorough analysis of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and regulatory risks is critical before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistent financial performance necessitates a deep dive into the underlying reasons for the volatility in revenue, profitability, and ROE. The projected negative alpha against the S&P 500 suggests a need to consider whether this outperformance is sustainable.
