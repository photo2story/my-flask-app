## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Report

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The following analysis is based on the provided data.  Significant discrepancies exist between the data points provided, requiring further investigation into data source accuracy and consistency.  The analysis below assumes the data's validity, but this should be confirmed independently.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 165.71%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 46.43%
* **Return Difference:** 119.3% (This is the raw difference; the relative divergence of 78.5% indicates its position within the historical range of divergence between COIN and VOO.  High relative divergence doesn't automatically imply superior performance).

The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta values show significant variation across different time periods, highlighting the volatility inherent in COIN.  The negative Beta for 2021-2023 is unusual and warrants further investigation.  The drastically increasing CAGR suggests that COIN's performance might be subject to significant market swings.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 43.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 62.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 211.0% | 24.9% | 151.0% | 0.1 | 72.9 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $291.33
* **Previous Close:** $301.30
* **Change:** -$3.31 (a decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $288.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $279.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $287.50

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend in the short term.  The recent price decrease of -$3.31 is notable.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 64.76 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions, but closer to overbought).
* **PPO:** 0.76 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum).
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7% (Indicates a recent short-term decline in relative performance compared to a benchmark; likely VOO).
* **Expected Return:** -2.6% (Long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to S&P 500. This suggests negative alpha over the long term, assuming this estimate is reliable.)

The conflicting signals from RSI and PPO warrant further analysis. The negative expected return contrasts with the historical high cumulative return, suggesting possible mean reversion.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30  | $1.21B      |

| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01 | $0.67B      |

There's a significant discrepancy in the data for October 30, 2024 and inconsistencies in EPS and revenue figures which require clarification. The high EPS in Q2 2024 is an outlier and needs further investigation to understand the underlying cause.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

COIN shows exceptionally high cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500.  However, the data reveals inconsistencies and volatility in earnings, technical indicators, and financial metrics.  The high CAGR is accompanied by significant MDD, suggesting substantial risk.  The negative expected return, despite the historically high cumulative return, suggests caution.  The considerable discrepancies within the provided data necessitate thorough validation before drawing definitive conclusions. Further investigation into the underlying causes of these variations is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, while the long-term outlook is uncertain and highly dependent on the cryptocurrency market's overall performance and COIN's ability to maintain its market share.  Due to the data inconsistencies, the analysis is limited, and additional research is strongly recommended.
