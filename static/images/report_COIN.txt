## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return of COIN is 169.79%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 46.49%. The difference is 123.3%, placing it at the 99.19th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates COIN's strong outperformance relative to the broader market over the measured period, though past performance is not indicative of future results.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -47.0% | 76.7%  | -82.0%| 2.8   | 35.6   |
| 2022-2024  | 29.3%  | 70.5%  | 0.4%  | 3.0   | 66.7   |

The high beta values (2.8 and 3.0) indicate COIN is significantly more volatile than the market.  The negative alpha in 2021-2023 suggests underperformance compared to the market-adjusted risk, while the positive alpha in 2022-2024 suggests outperformance.  The large swings in CAGR and MDD highlight the significant risk associated with investing in COIN.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 324.57
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 303.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 247.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 199.76

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend. However, the relatively large gap between the price and the 20 and 60-day moving averages indicates potential volatility and a recent sharp increase.  The difference between the last market price (324.51) and the closing price (324.57) is negligible and doesn't indicate any significant immediate market reaction.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (70.87):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70), suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (2.54):** Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (48.63, +):**  Strong positive divergence, indicating bullish momentum.
* **Expected Return (0.1%):**  A very low expected return, implying the potential for substantial gains relative to S&P 500 during a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon is currently modest. However, it is important to contextualize this given the stock's inherent volatility.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3    | $1.21 B       |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15   | $1.45 B       |
| 2024-05-02 | 4.84   | $1.64 B       |
| 2023-11-02 | -0.01  | $0.67 B       |
| 2024-10-30 | -0.01  | $0.67 B       |


The most recent earnings (October 30, 2024) show a positive EPS of $0.3 and revenue of $1.21B.  However, there is significant volatility in EPS and revenue figures across the reported quarters.  The substantial increase in EPS from $0.15 to $4.84 between August 1st and May 2nd 2024  indicates potentially significant events impacting profitability within that period, requiring further investigation.  The two entries for October 30th 2024 show discrepancies; this requires clarification and cross-referencing with other financial data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase (COIN) shows significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the given period, however this is coupled with high volatility and risk. Recent price action suggests a potential upward trend, supported by positive technical indicators, although RSI suggests caution.  However, the financial performance data reveals significant volatility and inconsistencies that need further clarification.  The provided expected return is exceptionally low, though this must be interpreted in context of the inherently higher risk and potential higher rewards compared to the S&P 500.  A complete analysis requires further investigation into the discrepancies in the financial statements, clarification on the recent earnings reports, and detailed review of the latest news and analyst opinions.  The high beta indicates considerable sensitivity to market movements.  Further research is needed before making any investment decisions.
