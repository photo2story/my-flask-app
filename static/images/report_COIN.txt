## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return of COIN is 159.54%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 49.2%. The difference is 110.34%, placing it at the 92.27th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates COIN's substantial outperformance compared to the broader market, although this is based on historical data and doesn't guarantee future performance.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -47.0%   | 76.7%  | -82.0%| 2.8   | 35.6   |
| 2022-2024  | 24.4%    | 70.5%  | -6.1% | 3.0   | 62.4   |

The high beta values (2.8 and 3.0) suggest COIN is significantly more volatile than the market.  The negative alpha values for 2021-2023 indicate underperformance relative to the market risk adjusted returns during that period. However, a positive alpha in 2022-2024 suggests outperformance during that timeframe.  The negative CAGR for 2021-2023 highlights the significant losses experienced during that period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $312.22 (Last Market: $312.45)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $311.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $267.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $207.62

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting upward momentum.  The significant difference between the short-term (5-day) and longer-term (20-day and 60-day) averages indicates a recent, relatively sharp price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 71.95 – Approaching overbought territory (generally considered >70). This suggests potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.17 – Negative value indicates bearish momentum.  This contradicts the upward trend implied by the moving averages.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +38.8 – Indicates strong short-term upward momentum over the past 20 days.
* **Expected Return:** 0.11% – This represents the projected long-term (2+ years) excess return relative to the S&P 500, assuming continued investment.  This low figure should be viewed cautiously considering the high volatility and uncertainty in the crypto market.  The $312.45 price doesn't seem to suggest a dramatic sudden jump or fall, but rather a consolidation following a recent upward trend.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500 historically. However, it also exhibits high volatility and a history of substantial losses.  While recent financial results show improvement and the price is currently showing upward momentum, technical indicators paint a mixed picture. The high RSI suggests caution, and the negative PPO implies bearish momentum.  The projected long-term excess return is low, but this is highly uncertain given the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.  Further investigation into recent news, earnings announcements (compared to expectations), and analyst ratings is critical before making any investment decisions.
