**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B)  |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|--------|---------|

| 2023-2025  | 184.0%   | 74.8%    | 142.0%   | 0.1    | 82.1    |

*   **Alpha:** Consistently high positive Alpha values indicate that Coinbase is significantly outperforming its benchmark (S&P 500).  This is the excess return achieved above what would be expected based on the market's return.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values close to 0 suggest very low correlation to the overall market (S&P 500). This implies that Coinbase's price movements are largely independent of the broader market trends.

**Analysis:** The price is currently above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, but below the 20-day moving average. The recent price increase suggests a potential short-term upward trend.

*   **Potential investors:** Should be aware of the significant risk and potential for large price swings. Further research into the reasons behind the recent EPS surge is warranted.
*   **Current holders:** Should consider the sell signal from the hybrid indicator and monitor the situation closely. Managing risk through diversification and position sizing is crucial.
