**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The provided data reveals significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), substantial volatility, and mixed recent financial performance. Further detailed analysis follows.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 165.71%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 46.43%
* **Return Difference:** 119.28%  (This represents the difference in cumulative returns between COIN and VOO as of the last date in the dataset.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 78.5% (Indicates COIN's performance is at the 78.5th percentile of its historical divergence from VOO, based on the provided min/max range).

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows extremely high returns for COIN, especially exceeding that of the S&P500.  However, the high Beta values suggest significant market sensitivity – COIN's price movements are heavily influenced by broader market trends. While Alpha is mostly positive, implying outperformance after adjusting for market risk,  it's crucial to consider the high volatility (MDD – Maximum Drawdown) experienced. The fluctuating Alpha and Beta highlight the risk and reward dynamics associated with COIN.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 42.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 61.1 |
| 2023-2025  | 211.0% | 24.9% | 151.0% | 0.1 | 71.8 |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $288.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $279.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $287.50

The price is currently slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a minor downward trend in the short term.  However, it sits above the 20-day moving average, indicating potential short-term support. The recent price drop of $4.73 might be considered a minor correction within a larger upward trend.

* **PPO:** 0.76 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7% (Indicates a recent slight weakening of the upward trend).
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -2.6% (This suggests that despite past outperformance,  long-term returns may lag behind the S&P 500 by this margin. This projection likely reflects the inherent volatility and uncertainty of the cryptocurrency market).  The large price change in the last market data (-1.62%) warrants further investigation into the underlying cause and could influence the overall outlook.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown remarkable past performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this has come with substantial volatility.  Recent financial results display inconsistency, with fluctuating revenue and EPS.  While technical indicators point to neither overbought nor oversold conditions, the recent price drop and negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggest caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the earnings volatility and the recent price drop is warranted before making any investment decisions.  The high Beta underscores the inherent risk associated with COIN, making it unsuitable for risk-averse investors. Long-term investors should carefully weigh the potential for high returns against the considerable risk and volatility.  A thorough due diligence considering broader market trends and cryptocurrency sector dynamics is essential.
