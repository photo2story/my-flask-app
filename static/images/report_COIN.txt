## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return for COIN is 153.25%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 48.47%. The difference is 104.78%, placing it at the 89.31st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates COIN has significantly outperformed the benchmark index over the measured period, though this outperformance may not be sustainable.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD  | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -47.0%  | 76.7% | -82.0%| 2.8   | 35.6   |
| 2022-2024  | 21.4%   | 70.5% | -8.7% | 3.0   | 60.5   |

The high beta values (2.8 and 3.0) suggest COIN's price is highly volatile and sensitive to market movements. The negative alpha in 2021-2023 indicates underperformance compared to the benchmark adjusted for risk, while the positive alpha in 2022-2024 shows improved performance relative to the benchmark.  The significant changes in CAGR highlight the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $304.64 (Last-market: $304.49)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $313.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $262.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $205.48

The price is currently above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, but below the 5-day moving average, hinting at recent price decline. This indicates some short-term weakness despite the longer-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (71.96):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term pullback.
* **PPO (0.19):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (40.43,+):** Shows a strong short-term upward movement relative to the comparison index.
* **Expected Return (0.22%):**  A long-term (2+ years) investment is projected to yield 0.22% above the S&P 500 return. This is a relatively low expected excess return compared to the historical outperformance.  Further investigation into this projection's basis is warranted.

The difference between the last market price and the closing price is negligible.  Therefore, no significant sudden price movements (sharp increases or decreases) are apparent.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown significant volatility and outperformance against the S&P 500 over the past period, but this high volatility and the recent downturn in revenue warrants caution.  High beta suggests significant market sensitivity. While recent earnings showed positive EPS, the declining revenue and profit margins need to be thoroughly analyzed.  Technical indicators show a potential short-term pullback, despite the positive momentum.  The provided long-term expected return is relatively low, given the historical outperformance.  A thorough review of the most recent earnings report, compared to analyst expectations, and current market sentiment is essential before making any investment decisions.  The analysis provided here is based on limited historical data and does not include current market dynamics and news.
