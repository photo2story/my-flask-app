2025-04-01 - Analysis Report
## Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Coinbase Global, Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  This report analyzes COIN's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering recent price movements, financial indicators, and earnings data to assess its investment potential.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

COIN's cumulative return (46.46%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's return (24.37%) over the analyzed period.  The relative divergence of 22.1 points places COIN in the 38.8th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 (max 151.0, min -59.7).

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across the periods, suggesting strong growth.  However, the consistently near-zero alpha suggests COIN's returns are largely explained by market movements (high beta values confirm this market sensitivity).  The high beta also indicates substantial risk.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 72.0% | 59.1% | 71.0% | 0.0 | 40.2 |
| 2022-2024  | 117.0% | 79.2% | 95.0% | 0.0 | 57.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 94.0% | 79.2% | 51.0% | 0.1 | 43.6 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

COIN's closing price is $188.58.  However, the last market data shows a recent decline: $171.6 (a -$1.34 change from the previous close of $173.93).  The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting bearish momentum:

* 5-day moving average: $195.93
* 20-day moving average: $197.06
* 60-day moving average: $244.75

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk) indicating moderate volatility.
* **RSI:** 38.36, suggesting the stock is potentially oversold, but not necessarily a strong buy signal.
* **PPO:** 1.27,  a positive value indicates bullish momentum, although the interpretation requires context within the broader market trend.
* **Relative Divergence:**  -3.8, indicating recent short-term downward price movement.
* **Expected Return:** -0.2%. The recent price drop (-$1.34) reflects market conditions.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy might yield above-market returns considering historical performance, but this is subject to significant cryptocurrency market volatility and regulatory risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown significant growth potential, outperforming the S&P 500. However, its high beta and volatile earnings indicate substantial risk. The recent price drop and the below-average moving averages signal a potential short-term bearish trend.  While long-term prospects might be positive given the cryptocurrency market's potential, investors should exercise caution due to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency sector and the significant risk associated with a high-beta stock.  Further investigation into regulatory changes and the broader cryptocurrency market outlook is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The accuracy of the provided data (especially the duplicate 2024-10-30 entry) should be independently verified.
