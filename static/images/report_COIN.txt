### 7. 종합 analysis

**Overall Assessment:**

Coinbase (COIN) has demonstrated substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, underscored by its high CAGR and Alpha. Financial health is reflected in fluctuating revenue and high profit margins. Additionally, increasing equity suggests that the company has maintained and grown its net assets, strengthening its balance sheet.

However, the stock's high MDD indicates significant volatility. The RSI currently suggests the stock is oversold, which may attract buyers. Furthermore, the recent hybrid signal of reducing holdings to a cash ratio of 69% signals caution in the short term. Recent news highlights volatility and significant market events, indicating it is important to monitor news and company announcements.

**Recommendation:**

Given the high growth potential and strong financial health, a cautious approach is advised. The hybrid signal indicates a need for risk management, suggesting that investors should consider reducing holdings while remaining alert to future developments. A long-term investment perspective may benefit from the potential 6.3% return and strong growth metrics, but should be balanced with an awareness of short-term volatility.
