2024-11-25 - Analysis Report
## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Report

This report analyzes Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN), a cryptocurrency exchange platform, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Coinbase's cumulative return (153.25%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) return (48.47%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 104.78%, placing it in the 89.31st percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500. This indicates COIN's performance has been substantially higher than the S&P 500 over the observed period, but the high relative divergence suggests a significant degree of volatility.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures show volatility: -47% for 2021-2023 and 21.4% for 2022-2024.  High maximum drawdown (MDD) values further highlight the substantial risk associated with this investment.  A high Alpha (3.0) suggests superior returns relative to the market, but a very high Beta (60.5) indicates extreme sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $304.64 (Last Market: $298.78)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $313.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $262.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $205.48

The price is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bullish trend, but below the 5-day, indicating a recent price pullback.  The gap between the short-term (5-day) and longer-term moving averages indicates potential price volatility.  The Last-Market price of $298.78 suggests a slight dip from the closing price, but this is not a significant drop.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (71.96):**  Approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (0.19):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but relatively low, which suggests the momentum might not be particularly strong.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (40.43+):**  Indicates a recent surge in relative performance against the S&P 500.

Considering the last market price ($298.78) is close to the closing price, there's no evidence of a sudden sharp increase or decrease.


**4. Recent Financial Performance & Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows significant volatility in earnings per share (EPS) and revenue.  While some quarters show strong revenue and high profit margins, others show losses.  The recent EPS of 0.3 for 2024-10-30 suggests some improvement, but requires comparison to analyst expectations for a thorough assessment.  The revenue figures also show variability. Further analysis including analyst forecasts and detailed financial statements is needed for a comprehensive outlook.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  High revenue figures are observed across most quarters, with profit margins generally above 70%. However, there's significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuation.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity fluctuates, and Return on Equity (ROE) is inconsistent, indicating variable profitability.  High ROE in Q1 2024 is noteworthy, but needs further investigation into the underlying drivers.

These financial metrics underscore the volatility and risk associated with Coinbase's business model.

Coinbase (COIN) exhibits strong performance relative to the S&P 500, but it's characterized by significant volatility and risk. The high Beta suggests extreme sensitivity to market fluctuations. While recent price action shows some bullish momentum, technical indicators suggest caution and the possibility of a short-term correction.  Financial performance has been inconsistent, showing both strong revenue and losses.  A thorough review of recent news, analyst opinions, and detailed financial statements is crucial to form a well-informed investment decision.  The high potential for reward comes with equally high potential for risk.  Long-term investors should consider its high volatility carefully.
