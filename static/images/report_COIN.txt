## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return of COIN (168.31%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (46.87%) by 121.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 79.4% indicates COIN's performance is considerably higher than the S&P 500 based on the historical data range.  However, it's crucial to note that this high relative divergence does not guarantee future outperformance.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2023-2025  | 237.0% | 43.5% | 166.0% | -0.0 | 74.0 |

The table shows exceptionally high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) for COIN,  but also significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  The Alpha is reported as -0.0. While beta is high (74.0), the reported alpha should be considered with caution.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $294.19
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $280.32
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $269.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $275.65

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, the recent closing price shows a slight decrease (-$0.44) compared to the previous close.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.24  (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.33 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 13.7% (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.

The slight price decrease (-$0.44) doesn't signal a significant immediate trend reversal, but it's important to monitor this along with the other technical indicators. The expected return of -3.0% suggests a pessimistic outlook in the short term.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not clearly stated but implied to be positive based on the overall strong past performance.
