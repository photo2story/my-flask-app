Here's a comprehensive analysis of Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) based on the provided data, formatted as a report.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO)**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a publicly traded American cryptocurrency exchange.  The cumulative return of COIN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last day in the dataset, COIN's cumulative return is 169.97%, while VOO's is 49.35%. The difference is 120.6 percentage points.  This places COIN at the 79.1 percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO, based on the provided min/max range. The alpha consistently shows a near-zero value, implying that the outperformance is not due to market-neutral strategies, but rather to higher market sensitivity (beta consistently around 75).

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $271.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $278.71

The current price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The recent price increase of $0.88 (from the previous close) reinforces this positive short-term momentum.

* **PPO:** 1.60 – Positive value indicates upward momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +5.7 – Indicates a recent increase in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** -2.9% – This suggests a negative expected return relative to the market over the long term (2+ years).  This contrasts sharply with the strong short-term performance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility:

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.3    | $1.21B         |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15   | $1.45B         |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84   | $1.64B         |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01  | $0.67B         |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01  | $0.67B         |


There's a clear outlier in Q2 2024 with exceptionally high EPS.  The other quarters show more consistent, though fluctuating, revenue and highly variable profitability.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of this volatility, potentially including market conditions specific to cryptocurrency trading. Note that there is a duplicate entry for 2024-10-30.

**5. Financial Information: Revenue and Profitability**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B     | 71.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B     | 74.99%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B     | 76.16%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B     | 71.13%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.67B     | 61.01%        |

Revenue shows a downward trend, though the profit margins remain relatively high, except for Q3 2023. The high variability in both revenue and profit margins points to the inherent volatility within the cryptocurrency market.

**Financial Information: Capital and Profitability**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE          |
|------------|------------|--------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B     | 0.86%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B     | 0.43%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B     | 14.57%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B     | 4.35%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $5.92B     | -0.04%       |

Equity is increasing, but ROE is inconsistent, highlighting the risk and reward associated with this sector.

**7. Overall Analysis**

COIN exhibits strong short-term performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term correction.  Earnings data is highly volatile, and the long-term expected return is negative relative to the market.  The high beta of 75 indicates high sensitivity to market movements, amplifying both gains and losses.  Investors should carefully weigh the significant risks associated with COIN's exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency market against its potential for high returns.  The negative long-term expected return warrants caution regarding long-term investment decisions without a much more in-depth understanding of the underlying business drivers and expected future market performance of the cryptocurrency markets.  Further analysis of the company’s specific activities and strategies is necessary to make a well-informed investment decision.
