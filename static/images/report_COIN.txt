## Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) Stock Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.

The cumulative return of COIN is 132.96%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 39.26%.  The difference is 93.7%, placing it in the 67.3rd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates COIN's performance has been substantially higher than the benchmark index over the analyzed period.  However, the high relative volatility is notable (max: 168.3, min: -59.7).

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 44.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | -0.0 | 62.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 179.0% | 24.9% | 125.0% | -0.0 | 64.0 |

The consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across the periods and significant Alpha values suggest strong outperformance against the market, although this is likely due to a higher beta (market sensitivity).  The relatively low MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates resilience despite market volatility.  However, the reported Alpha values appear erroneous as they should reflect the excess return above the market benchmark.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 historically. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  The high volatility and inconsistent earnings data require further investigation.  The projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern.  While long-term investment may be considered, thorough due diligence is crucial given the inherent risks in the cryptocurrency market and the company's performance volatility. The significant discrepancies in financial data (duplicate earnings report entries and extreme EPS swings) necessitates a careful review of COIN's financial statements and a deeper analysis of the drivers behind the reported figures.
