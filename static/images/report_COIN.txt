## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The provided data shows COIN's cumulative return significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 186.71%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 47.39%
* **Return Difference:** 139.3%  This places COIN at the 87.1st percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, based on the provided minimum and maximum divergence values.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Alpha/Beta analysis indicates high growth but also high risk, as reflected in the significant Maximum Drawdown (MDD). The negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market benchmark (after adjusting for beta).  The increasing beta implies growing market sensitivity over time.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Market Cap (B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-----------------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 44.0           |

The price is currently near its 20-day moving average, suggesting recent consolidation.  The price is significantly above its 60-day moving average, indicating a recent upward trend. The 5-day moving average being higher than the current price suggests a potential short-term downward correction.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which was not provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has demonstrated substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with significantly higher cumulative returns. However, this comes with high volatility and risk, as evidenced by the substantial MDD and erratic earnings.  The recent price movement shows some consolidation after a strong upward trend. Technical indicators present a mixed picture.  While the long-term expected return is high, the considerable volatility and inconsistent financial performance require careful consideration.  Further analysis incorporating current news, analyst sentiment, and a deeper dive into the drivers of revenue and EPS changes is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The lack of context around earnings beats/misses and the absence of recent news prevents a more complete assessment.
