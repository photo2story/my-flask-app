## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting substantial volatility.  Recent price action shows a slight downward trend, while financial performance shows mixed signals.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Coinbase's cumulative return of 152.30% vastly surpasses the S&P 500's 46.57% return.  The current divergence of 105.7 points, representing 72.5% of the historical range, indicates COIN's significant outperformance.  However, the high relative divergence should be viewed with caution given its volatility.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values across the periods, suggesting strong growth potential.  However, the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is substantial, highlighting considerable risk.  A negative Alpha value in the initial period implies underperformance relative to the market, which shifts to positive Alpha in subsequent periods.  The high Beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  Market cap has also been consistently increasing over time.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | -0.0 | 43.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 62.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 198.0% | 24.9% | 137.0% | 0.1 | 70.2 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $280.22
* **5-day Moving Average:** $276.12
* **20-day Moving Average:** $282.56
* **60-day Moving Average:** $290.49

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The recent price change ($2.09 increase) represents a small upward move relative to the previous close.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 42.05 (Slightly below the oversold threshold of 30, suggesting potential buying opportunities but not confirming a strong uptrend.)
* **PPO:** -0.47 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -2.9 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -2.6% (Indicates a potential negative return relative to the market over the long term (2+ years).  This negative expected return must be considered within the context of the higher risk profile of COIN compared to VOO.)


The recent price increase of $2.09, while positive, is not substantial enough to suggest a sharp rebound in a significant way.  Further price action is needed for a decisive signal.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.3     | $1.21B      |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15    | $1.45B      |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84    | $1.64B      |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01   | $0.67B      |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01   | $0.67B      |

There is significant variability in EPS, with a substantial spike in Q2 2024.  Revenue shows a general downward trend except for the outlier in Q2 2024.  Inconsistency in the data warrants further investigation.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.67B | 61.01%       |

Revenue shows a decline from Q1 2024 onward, although profit margins remain relatively high throughout.  This warrants further examination into the reasons for declining revenue.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE      |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43%    |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35%    |
| 2023-09-30 | $5.92B | -0.04%   |

Equity has generally increased, but ROE is volatile, with a significant peak in Q1 2024.  This needs further investigation to understand the underlying causes.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has shown exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial risk as indicated by its high Beta and MDD.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term downtrend, supported by technical indicators. While financial reports show high profit margins, inconsistent revenue trends and volatile profitability metrics necessitate deeper analysis to understand underlying drivers. The high past growth does not guarantee future success, and investors should carefully weigh the high risk against the potential reward.  Further research into the reasons behind the fluctuating earnings and revenue is critical before making any investment decisions.  The negative expected return, relative to the market, further underscores the need for caution.
