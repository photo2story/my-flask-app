## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Report

**0) Overview:** Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Coinbase (COIN) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for COIN is 146.98%, while VOO's is 48.36%. This results in a difference of 98.6%, placing it at the 69.4th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -59.7% and a maximum of 168.3%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) for COIN, ranging from 96% to 193% across different periods.  However, the Alpha values are close to zero, suggesting that the outperformance might primarily be driven by the high beta (market sensitivity) of COIN, ranging from 44.1 to 69.6.  A high beta indicates significant price volatility. The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) remains relatively consistent around 34.8%.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  Revenue fluctuates considerably, and while there were periods of high EPS (like in Q2 2024), there have also been substantial losses.  The October 2024 data shows a duplication, which should be investigated for accuracy.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3  | $1.21B        |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15 | $1.45B        |
| 2024-05-02 | 4.84 | $1.64B        |
| 2023-11-02 | -0.01| $0.67B        |
| 2024-10-30 | -0.01| $0.67B        |  *(Duplicate Data Point)*


**5) Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability show fluctuations.  While revenue is generally high, profit margins aren't consistently above 75%. Similarly, Equity and ROE (Return on Equity) are inconsistent, highlighting the volatility of the company's financial performance.  Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying drivers of these fluctuations.


| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.27B   | 75.56%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B   | 71.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B   | 74.99%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B   | 76.16%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B   | 71.13%        |

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE     |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.28B   | 12.56%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B    | 0.86%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B    | 0.43%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B    | 14.57%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B    | 4.35%   |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has demonstrated significant past outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this performance is coupled with high volatility (high beta), substantial risk (indicated by MDD and recent price action), and a negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500. The financial data reveals inconsistent revenue and profitability, adding to the overall risk profile.  The recent price drop and negative indicators suggest a bearish trend.  Investors should proceed with caution and carefully consider the high risk associated with this investment.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the earnings and financial data volatility is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated data point in the earnings report necessitates clarification.
