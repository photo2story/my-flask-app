The provided data shows COIN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a 50.5 percentage point higher cumulative return.  The high relative divergence (57.6%) indicates this outperformance is substantial compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 45.0% | -0.0 | 42.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 114.0% | -0.0 | 61.3 |
| 2023-2025  | 106.0% | 74.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 51.8 |

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across all periods highlights strong growth. However, the consistently high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) suggests significant volatility.  The near-zero alpha indicates COIN's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta), while the fluctuating Beta values reflect the changing market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $209.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $194.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $176.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $212.13

The price is above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  However, it's slightly below its 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance at this level. The recent price increase of $2.83 reflects a positive short-term momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 76.98 (Overbought)
* **PPO:** 3.32 (Positive momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +11.2% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.9% (Potential for underperformance relative to S&P 500 over the long term)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to a correction.  The positive PPO and upward relative divergence confirm short-term positive momentum.  However, the negative expected return flags a potential for underperformance against the S&P 500 in a longer-term outlook. The recent price increase indicates a short-term positive market sentiment.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30    | $1.21B         |

| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01   | $0.67B         |

Earnings are highly volatile.  Note the exceptionally high EPS in Q2 2024, which significantly skews the average.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers behind this volatility and the sustainability of future earnings.  There seems to be some duplication in the table; this needs clarification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase (COIN) has demonstrated substantial outperformance against the S&P 500 in the past, with consistently high revenue and profit margins. However, the high volatility in its price, earnings, and ROE highlights significant risk. The short-term indicators suggest positive momentum, but the overbought RSI and negative long-term expected return warrant caution.  A more in-depth analysis of the earnings volatility and a thorough understanding of the underlying drivers of the business are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high maximum drawdown across periods further reinforces the need for a cautious approach.  The duplicated data points in the earnings report require clarification and correction before drawing robust conclusions.
