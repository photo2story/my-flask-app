2024-12-10 - Analysis Report
## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**1) Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange.  Its cumulative return is reported as `nan` (Not a Number), indicating missing or unavailable data.  This contrasts sharply with the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 121.38%. The provided divergence data shows a maximum divergence of 168.4%, a minimum of -59.7%, and a current divergence of 168.4% (100% relative divergence).  This suggests COIN has significantly outperformed or underperformed the S&P 500 at different times, with a current significant outperformance. The missing cumulative return for COIN prevents a precise calculation.

**2) Recent Stock Price:**

The closing price is $343.62, with a last market price of $310.51.  This suggests a price increase since the last market close.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both revenue and EPS.

* **Latest Quarterly Results Comparison:** The most recent quarter (2024-10-30) shows a substantial drop in revenue ($1.21B vs $1.45B and $1.64B in previous quarters) and a decrease in EPS ($0.3 vs $0.15 and $4.84).  The previous quarter (2024-08-01) also showed a significant decrease in EPS compared to the quarter before (2024-05-02). There is also a duplicate entry for 2024-10-30, which could be an error in the provided data.

* **Revenue Growth Trends:** Revenue has a clear downward trend in recent quarters, indicating slowing growth or contraction.

* **EPS Trends and Significant Changes:** EPS has shown extreme volatility, with a large positive value in Q2 2024 ($4.84) followed by substantially lower values.  The significant drop in EPS from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024 is notable.  The negative EPS in Q4 2023 and what appears to be a duplicate entry for Q4 2024 warrant further investigation for data accuracy.

* **Beats or Misses:**  Without expectation data, it's impossible to determine whether these results beat or missed expectations.


**5) Financial Information:**

The provided financial data reveals interesting trends:

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a clear decline from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024.  Profit margins remain relatively high, fluctuating around 70%, except for a dip to 61% in Q3 2023.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown steady growth. ROE has fluctuated significantly, exhibiting high volatility with both substantial positive and negative values within a short period.  The extremely high ROE in Q1 2024 (14.57%) is notable and needs further investigation into the underlying drivers.

**Overall Financial Analysis:** Coinbase's financial performance shows strong profit margins but significant revenue decline and volatile EPS and ROE. The extreme fluctuations require further investigation into the underlying business factors driving this instability.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data needs clarification.

**6) News and Recent Issues:**  No recent (within the last 2 days) earnings news is provided.  Information regarding market outlook and analyst opinions is missing.

**7) Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase's performance is highly volatile. While profit margins remain relatively high, revenue is declining, and EPS and ROE show extreme fluctuations. The stock has significantly diverged from the S&P 500's performance, though the direction and extent are unclear due to the missing cumulative return data for COIN.  Further investigation is needed into the causes of the volatility, the accuracy of the provided data (especially the duplicate entry), and into recent news and analyst opinions to get a complete picture.  The missing data prevents a conclusive assessment of the company's current financial health and future prospects.
