## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

COIN's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While recent price action shows a short-term decline, key financial metrics reveal strong profitability and a substantial equity base. However, volatility remains a concern.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.

* **Cumulative Return:** COIN: 93.96%, VOO: 35.14%
* **Return Difference:** COIN outperformed VOO by 58.82 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 52.0% indicates COIN's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to VOO.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) but significant maximum drawdown (MDD). The high beta values indicate a strong correlation with overall market movements and increased volatility.  The alpha values fluctuate around zero, suggesting performance in line with or slightly better than market expectations in the provided periods.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 140.0% | 25.3% | 90.0% | 0.1 | 55.2 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $217.45
* **5-day Moving Average:** $214.47
* **20-day Moving Average:** $241.65
* **60-day Moving Average:** $268.83

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price increase (+$1.53) shows a small recovery, but the price remains significantly lower than its recent highs.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 24.67 (suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.79 (negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.2 (short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -2.3% (this indicates a potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, based on the current data. This is relative to the S&P 500 and not necessarily an absolute negative return).

The small recent price increase of $1.53 might be viewed as a minor bounce rather than a significant upward trend given the context of the moving averages and other indicators.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30   | $1.21B        |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15   | $1.45B        |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84   | $1.64B        |

| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01  | $0.67B        |

Earnings are highly volatile.  A significant jump in EPS in Q2 2024 is notable, followed by a substantial decrease in subsequent quarters. Revenue is generally high and fluctuating, though with less volatility than EPS.  The two entries for 2024-10-30 may indicate a data entry error.  Clarification on this data point is needed.

| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| 2024-12-31 | $10.28B | 12.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86% |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |

| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

COIN shows a strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, but significant volatility remains a key concern.  High profit margins and growing equity suggest a solid financial foundation. However, the highly volatile earnings and ROE, coupled with the currently bearish technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages), suggest caution.  The projected long-term underperformance against the S&P 500 (-2.3%) warrants careful consideration before investing.  Further investigation into the causes of earnings volatility and the data inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-10-30) is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high beta suggests COIN's price movements are heavily influenced by market sentiment, making it a riskier investment than the overall market.
