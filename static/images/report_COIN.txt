The provided alpha and beta analysis shows high volatility and inconsistent performance relative to the market (beta fluctuating significantly, alpha near zero, implying performance largely tracking the market, although with higher volatility).  Further investigation into market conditions and COIN's specific performance drivers during these periods is needed for a complete understanding.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $224.03

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.5% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (from current price):** -5.7% (Based on the provided `Last-market` data, indicating a recent price drop).  This is a short-term outlook.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not explicitly given and would require a more sophisticated model incorporating future market forecasts and COIN's projected growth.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  While Q2 2024 showed high EPS and revenue, subsequent quarters have seen a substantial drop, with negative EPS in Q4 2023 and Q4 2024 (data inconsistency, double entry of Q4 2024 needs clarification).  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes of this volatility.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3  | $1.21 B       |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15 | $1.45 B       |

| 2024-10-30 | -0.01 | $0.67 B       |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, though with some fluctuation. Profit margins are consistently high (70%+), indicating strong profitability. Equity has increased over time, suggesting overall financial health. ROE fluctuates, reflecting the volatility in earnings.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 over the analyzed periods, but this has been accompanied by substantial volatility.  Recent price action indicates a downward trend, supported by moving averages and short-term indicators.  Earnings have been highly volatile, with some quarters showing exceptionally strong performance followed by significant drops. While profit margins remain high, the inconsistency in earnings and the current negative short-term outlook warrant caution.  Further investigation into the drivers of the earnings volatility, and a more comprehensive long-term financial model, are needed to form a conclusive investment opinion.  The provided data suggests a high-risk, high-reward investment.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in COIN.  The conflicting data (duplicate Q4 2024 entry) needs to be clarified before a more robust conclusion can be reached.
