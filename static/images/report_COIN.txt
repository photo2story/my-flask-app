## Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a considerable divergence.  Recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, while longer-term prospects are less clear, depending on the cryptocurrency market.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 41.66%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 11.50%
* **Return Difference:** 30.2% (This is the difference in cumulative returns at the last data point.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 46.7% (This indicates COIN's performance is in the upper 46.7th percentile of its historical divergence from VOO, based on the provided min/max range).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta values indicate varying levels of risk and return relative to the market (presumably the S&P 500).  High Beta values suggest higher volatility than the market.  The inconsistent Alpha values (both positive and negative close to zero) suggest that COIN's returns are not consistently outperforming or underperforming the market.  Note that these are CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values. More data would be needed for robust conclusions.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 47.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 116.0% | 0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 80.0% | 74.8% | 69.0% | -0.0 | 44.8 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $176.58
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $170.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $179.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $226.03

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the 60-day MA indicates a significant price decline.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)  The MRI suggests a high-risk level, indicating potential volatility.
* **RSI:** 37.90 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions but not a definite buy signal).
* **PPO:** 1.01 (Positive, indicating a bullish momentum but needs further confirmation.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.1 (Short-term downward trend).
* **Expected Return:** -5.8% (This negative expected return suggests possible near-term losses, though the provided context indicates it’s for a specific short-term period. Long-term outlook is unclear)


The 0.62 price change from the previous close is a relatively small increase and not significant enough to indicate a rapid rebound on its own.  More context is needed to interpret this accurately.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data is inconsistent and shows significant volatility.  Revenue has fluctuated, and EPS has been both positive and negative.  Further investigation into the underlying factors driving this inconsistency is necessary.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3 | 1.21 B$ |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15 | 1.45 B$ |
| 2024-05-02 | 4.84 | 1.64 B$ |
| 2023-11-02 | -0.01 | 0.67 B$ |
| 2024-10-30 | -0.01 | 0.67 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows high revenue but fluctuating profitability.  The high profit margins are positive, but the inconsistent ROE suggests potential underlying challenges in leveraging equity effectively.  Further analysis is required to understand the causes of these fluctuations.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.27B | 75.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.28B | 12.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86% |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in terms of cumulative returns. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend.  The inconsistent earnings and ROE data indicate a need for deeper analysis of the company's financial health and future prospects.  The high-risk assessment from the MRI should be considered.  A long-term investment strategy should account for the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market and the company's dependence on it.  The -5.8% expected return is a short-term indication only;  the long-term outlook, particularly concerning S&P 500 outperformance, requires further in-depth analysis beyond the provided data.
