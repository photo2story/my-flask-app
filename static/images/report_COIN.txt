## Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Coinbase Global, Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  This report analyzes COIN's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), using provided financial data, technical indicators, and recent earnings.  COIN shows significant outperformance against the S&P 500 but exhibits volatility and mixed financial signals.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500.

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 143.44%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 47.15%
* **Return Difference:** 96.3% (Relative difference: 68.4% based on historical volatility)


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 44.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 63.9 |
| 2023-2025  | 189.0% | 24.9% | 128.0% | 0.1 | 69.6 |


The high CAGR demonstrates significant growth, but the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates substantial risk.  Alpha values suggest periods of both significant outperformance and underperformance relative to the market, reflecting the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Beta close to zero in earlier periods and close to 1 in the latest period indicate that volatility has decreased and the share price is closely correlated with the market.  Market capitalization has also grown substantially.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $270.37
* **Last Market Price:** $277.89 (+$2.78 change)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $280.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $280.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $291.16

The current price is slightly below recent moving averages, suggesting potential downward pressure.  The recent price increase may signal short-term recovery but the overall trend needs more monitoring.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 43.96 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.49 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -13.6% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.1% (Compared to S&P 500)

The technical indicators paint a mixed picture. While the RSI is close to oversold, the negative PPO and negative relative divergence suggest bearish momentum in the short term.  The negative expected return indicates a potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, however this needs to be viewed in light of the high volatility and possible periods of outperformance, as indicated in the Alpha analysis.  The recent price increase (+$2.78) is a minor upward correction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue          |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30  | $1.21B           |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15  | $1.45B           |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84  | $1.64B           |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01 | $0.67B           |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01 | $0.67B           |

Earnings show significant volatility, with both substantial profits and losses.  The outlier of $4.84 EPS in Q2 2024 needs further investigation to understand the underlying factors. There seems to be a reporting error as the 2024-10-30 date is listed twice.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13% |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.67B | 61.01% |

Revenue shows some fluctuation, while profit margins are generally high but also inconsistent.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86% |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35% |
| 2023-09-30 | $5.92B | -0.04% |

Equity is growing, but ROE is volatile and not consistently high.  This underlines the risk and uncertainty associated with this investment.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

COIN has shown remarkable growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this outperformance comes with substantial volatility and risk, reflected in the high MDD and fluctuating financial performance. While the high profit margins are encouraging, the inconsistency in earnings and ROE highlight significant uncertainty.  The technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish outlook, but the proximity to oversold territory on the RSI warrants close monitoring for potential reversal.  Long-term investors should be prepared for significant price swings and potentially lower returns than initially predicted relative to the S&P 500, though periods of substantial outperformance are possible.  Further analysis is recommended to delve deeper into the factors contributing to the volatile earnings and to understand the long-term growth prospects of the company.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate date and outlier EPS) need further clarification before definitive conclusions can be drawn.
