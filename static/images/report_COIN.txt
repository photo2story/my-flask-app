Coinbase has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500 historically, but this comes with considerable volatility.  High beta and fluctuating earnings suggest high risk.

While long-term potential exists given past outperformance,  the current high-risk profile and inconsistent financial results necessitate cautious consideration.  Further due diligence, including a thorough review of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The presence of data inconsistencies further emphasizes the need for more reliable data for a conclusive analysis.
