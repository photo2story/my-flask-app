The high risk indicator and recent price drop reinforce caution.  The long-term projected return remains positive, suggesting a potential investment opportunity for long-term investors with high risk tolerance, but careful monitoring is crucial due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market and Coinbase's sensitivity to market conditions.  Further investigation into the outlier data points (especially the 2024-05-02 earnings) is recommended.
