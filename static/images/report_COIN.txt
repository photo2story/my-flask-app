## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:** Coinbase Global, Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  This report analyzes COIN's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), incorporating recent price movements, financial indicators (RSI, PPO), earnings data, and financial statements.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase's cumulative return (87.64%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (39.38%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 48.3%, placing it in the 47.4th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 (based on a range of -59.7% to 168.3%).

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 133.0% | 27.8% | 80.0% | 0.1 | 52.9 |

**Analysis:**  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) indicates strong historical growth. However, the significant alpha values suggest that COIN's performance is not entirely explained by market movements (Beta near zero suggests low correlation with the market).  The relatively high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market and COIN's exposure to it.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $208.37
* **Previous Close:** $212.96
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $219.25
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $262.40
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $279.08

**Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent price change shows a decrease of -2.16%, indicating a short-term bearish signal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 28.63 (Below 30, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -2.95 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -14.9% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.8% (Expected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 for long-term investment)

**Analysis:** The low RSI and negative PPO suggest the stock is oversold and bearish momentum is present. The negative expected return indicates a lower projected return than the S&P 500 over the long term.  The recent price drop (-2.16%) reflects a potential short-term correction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30    | $1.21B        |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15    | $1.45B        |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84    | $1.64B        |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01   | $0.67B        |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01   | $0.67B        |

**Analysis:**  Earnings are highly volatile. There's a significant jump in EPS in Q2 2024 ($4.84), followed by a substantial decrease in subsequent quarters. Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains relatively stable.  Inconsistencies require further investigation.  Note the duplicate entry for October 30th, 2024 â€“ this needs clarification.

| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B   | 0.86%     |

| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B   | 4.35%     |

**Analysis:**  High and relatively stable profit margins are positive. However, ROE fluctuates significantly, requiring further investigation into the factors driving this volatility.  The substantial increase in equity in Q4 2024 is noteworthy and needs further context.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has demonstrated strong historical growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, its performance is highly volatile, exhibiting a high MDD. Current technical indicators (RSI, PPO) and recent price action suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  The inconsistent earnings data and fluctuating ROE require a more in-depth analysis. While long-term potential might exist given the company's position in the cryptocurrency market, the projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 warrants caution.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate earnings report, volatile ROE and earnings) is crucial before making any investment decisions.
