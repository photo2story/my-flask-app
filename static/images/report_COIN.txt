## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return of COIN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last data point, COIN's cumulative return is 162.46%, while VOO's is 44.14%. This represents a difference of 118.3 percentage points.  The relative divergence places COIN at the 78.1th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO (range: -59.7% to 168.3%).  This suggests COIN's performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500 over the measured period.

The provided CAGR data shows substantial growth, albeit with high maximum drawdown (MDD). The high beta values indicate significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  Alpha values near zero suggest performance largely tracks market movements, though the high CAGR overshadows this.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 44.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | -0.0 | 62.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 208.0% | 24.9% | 150.0% | -0.0 | 72.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $287.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $263.90
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $288.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $264.93

The price is currently slightly above its 20-day moving average, suggesting a relatively stable short-term trend.  However, it's significantly above its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, potentially indicating a recent surge.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 42.06 (Slightly below neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -1.00 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.8 (Positive, indicating short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.6% (This suggests a potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, despite the recent strong performance.)  The high current price ($287.76) needs further investigation to determine if a correction or sharp reversal is likely, as this could impact the long-term projection.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue          |

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13% |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.67B | 61.01% |

Revenue is showing a generally downward trend, although profit margins remain relatively high.  The data needs further investigation, to identify the reason for a drop in revenue given the high profit margin, and if the repeated entry for 2024-10-30 is an error.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86% |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35% |
| 2023-09-30 | $5.92B | -0.04% |

Equity is generally increasing, but ROE is highly volatile.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  The provided data lacks this crucial context.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown exceptionally strong performance relative to the S&P 500 in the past, indicated by a large cumulative return difference. However, recent earnings data reveals significant volatility and a concerning downward trend in revenue.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with a slightly bearish PPO but positive short-term momentum.  The projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 raises concerns, especially given the high current price and the need to clarify inconsistencies in the data. A thorough analysis requires additional data, including clarification on the duplicate 2024-10-30 earnings data, current market sentiment, and analyst projections.  The high volatility suggests a higher-risk investment.
