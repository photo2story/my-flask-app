This report analyzes Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN), a cryptocurrency exchange platform, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase's cumulative return (153.43%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (47.20%). The difference is 106.2%, placing it in the 72.8th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a historical range of 168.3% to -59.7%).  The provided CAGR data shows high growth, but also high maximum drawdown (MDD), suggesting significant volatility.  Alpha and Beta values fluctuate, suggesting the stock's performance isn't consistently correlated to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $274.41
* **5-day Moving Average:** $274.96
* **20-day Moving Average:** $302.30
* **60-day Moving Average:** $255.21

The price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 35.30 – Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -2.57 – Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -4.9% – Shows a recent short-term decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -4.6% –  This suggests that, based on current projections, long-term investment in COIN may underperform the S&P 500 by 4.6% over a period of 2 years or more.  This negative expectation should be considered in light of the high volatility suggested by other data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both revenue and EPS.

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates considerably. There's a notable drop from Q1 2024 ($1.64B) to Q3 2024 ($1.21B).
* **EPS:**  EPS is highly variable, ranging from a high of $4.84 in Q1 2024 to a low of -$0.01 in Q4 2023 and Q4 2024.  This indicates inconsistent profitability.  Note the inconsistency between the EPS in Q4 2024 and the provided Profit Margin data.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a generally downward trend from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024. Profit margins are high but also inconsistent. The drop in revenue is not entirely reflected in a proportional drop in profit margin, however.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows an upward trend, but ROE is highly volatile, indicating fluctuating profitability and efficiency.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **No recent earnings news (within the last 2 days) is provided.**  More information is needed to assess recent market outlook and analyst opinions.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has shown exceptional growth compared to the S&P 500 in the past, but recent data reveals significant volatility and inconsistencies in both price and financial performance.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the PPO and relative divergence point to bearish momentum.  Earnings reports show high variability in revenue and especially EPS, hindering consistent profit generation.  The projected negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests a cautious approach to long-term investment.  Additional data, such as news and analyst reports, would provide a more comprehensive view.  The high volatility observed in past performance should be considered a significant risk factor.  The provided data shows a disconnect between the high profit margins and the volatile EPS values, indicating a need for further investigation into underlying financial factors.
