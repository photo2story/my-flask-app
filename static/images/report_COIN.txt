**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  Over the period analyzed, COIN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a 26.5% higher cumulative return. However, the relative divergence suggests this outperformance is not exceptionally unusual historically.  The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility in yearly performance, ranging from 62% to 136%, with high maximum drawdown (MDD) figures.  The consistently near-zero alpha suggests COIN's returns are largely correlated to market movements (high beta values).

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | -0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 77.0% | 74.8% | -0.0 | 43.7 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent closing price of $172.21 shows a decline of $1.91 from the previous close.  The price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a bearish trend. The significant difference between the current price and the 60-day moving average indicates a substantial drop from its recent high.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 42.05 suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce. However, the negative recent relative divergence (-0.6) and the negative expected return (-7%) suggest caution.  The MRI of 0.41 indicates medium risk. The large price change (-$1.91) reflects a notable price drop, however, not a “crash” or “plummet”.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While Q2 2024 showed strong revenue and EPS, the recent quarters exhibit considerably lower numbers. Further analysis of the underlying reasons for this volatility is necessary.

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출       |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3   | 1.21 B$     |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15  | 1.45 B$     |
| 2024-05-02 | 4.84  | 1.64 B$     |
| 2023-11-02 | -0.01 | 0.67 B$     |
| 2024-10-30 | -0.01 | 0.67 B$     | *(Duplicate Data Entry Likely)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information reveals high profit margins consistently above 70%, indicating strong profitability. However, Equity and ROE show volatility,  suggesting potential challenges in capital management and efficiency in certain quarters. Further investigation into the causes of the fluctuations in ROE is recommended.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.27B | 75.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.28B | 12.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86% |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has shown strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However,  recent price action and indicators suggest a bearish trend. While high profit margins are positive,  the volatility in earnings, ROE, and price action raises concerns.  The negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 is a significant factor to consider. A deeper dive into the underlying drivers of earnings volatility and the reasons behind the current price decline is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the market conditions affecting the cryptocurrency sector is also warranted.  The data suggests a high-risk, high-reward investment profile.
