**1) Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), COIN has significantly outperformed over the analyzed period, exhibiting a 44.1% higher cumulative return.  The relative divergence suggests that this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical range against VOO.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | -0.0 | 42.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | -0.0 | 61.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 102.0% | 74.8% | -0.0 | 50.8 |

The high CAGR values indicate strong growth, though the significant Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlights considerable risk.  The near-zero alpha suggests COIN's returns are primarily driven by market movements (Beta), with high Beta values indicating substantial volatility.  Note that the Alpha is near zero likely due to data limitations in the analysis period.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $206.5
* **5-day Moving Average:** $200.86
* **20-day Moving Average:** $191.88
* **60-day Moving Average:** $200.38

The price is slightly above its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a relatively stable short-term trend. However, the price is significantly higher than the 20-day moving average which can be interpreted as a potential short-term upward momentum. The last market price shows a recent decrease of -3.48, signifying a potential short-term reversal.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 73.60 (Overbought territory, indicating potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.83 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -3.2% (Short-term negative expected return, reflecting the recent price drop)
* **Long-term Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):**  Requires further analysis. Data provided doesn't directly quantify long-term S&P 500 outperformance potential beyond the historical analysis.

The recent price drop of -3.48 could be interpreted as a minor correction within the overall upward trend.  The overbought RSI and relatively high Beta suggest caution is warranted.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2025-05-08 | 0.26    | $2.03 B      |
| 2024-10-30 | 0.30    | $1.21 B      |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15    | $1.45 B      |
| 2024-05-02 | 4.84    | $1.64 B      |
| 2025-05-08 | 4.84    | $1.64 B      |

There's an inconsistency in the data (duplicate entry for 2025-05-08 and 2024-05-02).  Assuming the first entry for each date is correct, revenue fluctuates, and EPS is highly volatile. A more thorough analysis of reported earnings is needed to draw meaningful conclusions.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31  | $2.03B  | 75.29%        |
| 2024-12-31  | $2.27B  | 75.56%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $1.21B  | 71.00%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $1.45B  | 74.99%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $1.64B  | 75.01%        |

Revenue shows some fluctuation. Profit margins are consistently high, indicating strong profitability.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE      |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-03-31  | $10.47B | 0.63%     |
| 2024-12-31  | $10.28B | 12.56%    |
| 2024-09-30  | $8.73B  | 0.86%     |
| 2024-06-30  | $8.37B  | 0.43%     |
| 2024-03-31  | $8.07B  | 14.57%    |

Equity is generally increasing, but ROE fluctuates significantly, suggesting variability in profitability.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown strong performance compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial volatility.  The high Beta reflects this risk.  While recent earnings show high profit margins, there's significant fluctuation in revenue and EPS, requiring more detailed analysis.  The short-term outlook is uncertain given the overbought RSI and recent price drop. A long-term investment might be considered if the investor has a high risk tolerance and believes in the long-term growth potential of the cryptocurrency market, however further analysis including sector-specific risk, interest rate risk, and regulatory risk should be conducted before investing. The provided data, however, does not allow for the quantification of a long-term outperformance against the S&P 500.  More comprehensive financial data and a deeper understanding of the cryptocurrency market are needed for a complete investment decision.
