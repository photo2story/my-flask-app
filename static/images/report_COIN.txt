**1. Performance Analysis:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a cryptocurrency exchange platform.  Over the analyzed period, COIN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 62.47% compared to VOO's 19.88%.  The relative divergence of 53.6% highlights this substantial outperformance, placing it in the upper range of historical performance relative to the S&P 500. However, this should be viewed in context of the historical volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 45.0% | -0.0 | 44.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 114.0% | -0.0 | 63.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 101.0% | 74.8% | 82.0% | -0.0 | 52.2 |

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures show strong growth, however, the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate significant risk. The Alpha values are unusually high, which warrant further investigation into their calculation methodology.  The beta close to zero suggests low correlation with the overall market, which is characteristic of high-growth, high-risk assets.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of COIN is slightly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term pullback.  The price is above both its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating positive short-term momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 75.98 indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction might be imminent. The positive PPO value confirms the bullish momentum, but the high RSI suggests caution. The negative change in relative divergence (-4.0) indicates a recent short-term decline.  The medium risk MRI (0.3776) is consistent with the overall picture of relatively high risk and reward.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3  | 1.21 B$     |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15 | 1.45 B$     |
| 2024-05-02 | 4.84 | 1.64 B$     |
| 2023-11-02 | -0.01| 0.67 B$     |
| 2024-10-30 | -0.01| 0.67 B$     |

Earnings show significant volatility.  A huge spike in EPS and revenue in May 2024 is followed by a decline in later quarters. This volatility highlights the inherent risk associated with COIN.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of this volatility.  Duplicate entries for Oct 30, 2024, need clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis. This missing information significantly limits the ability to assess the company's financial health and long-term prospects.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has demonstrated exceptional returns exceeding the S&P 500 over the specified period.  However, this high return is accompanied by significant volatility and risk, as evidenced by the high MDD, overbought RSI, and inconsistent earnings.  The missing financial data hinders a complete assessment.  The positive short-term momentum is tempered by the risk of a correction.  A long-term investment in COIN (as suggested by the -3.8% expected return against the S&P 500) should be approached with caution, given the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market and the lack of comprehensive financial data. Further investigation into the inconsistencies in the data provided is crucial before forming a definitive investment strategy.
