**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -47.0%   | 76.7% | -82.0% | 2.8  | 35.6  |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $302.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $236.04
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $195.85

The price is above all moving averages, suggesting an upward trend, although the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day MA suggests recent price consolidation.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (67.17):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally considered >70), suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (2.85):** Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (37.68% +):**  Shows a strong recent upward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.09%):**  A low expected return of 0.09% over the long term suggests a potential for lower returns compared to the risk. This is likely a conservative estimate given the volatility of COIN.
* **Price of $306.42:** This price is not unusually high given the recent upward trend; however, a sharp increase from a lower price would suggest a rapid price surge.
