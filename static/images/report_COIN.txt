## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  Over the period analyzed, COIN's cumulative return is 166.0%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 46.57%.  The difference is 119.43%, placing it at the 97.13th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  While this indicates strong relative performance,  the high volatility (as evidenced by the provided max and min values for the divergence) should be noted.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -47.0% | 76.7%  | -82.0%| 2.8   | 35.6   |
| 2022-2024  | 27.5%  | 70.5%  | -1.5% | 3.0   | 66.5   |

The high beta values (2.8 and 3.0) indicate COIN is significantly more volatile than the market.  The negative alpha in 2021-2023 suggests underperformance relative to the market's risk-adjusted return during that period. However, the positive alpha in 2022-2024, despite high volatility, implies it outperformed market expectations in that specific period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $320.01
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $310.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $253.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $201.79

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The significant difference between the short-term (5-day) and longer-term (60-day) averages indicates recent strong upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 79.04 (Overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.98 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** 50.77 (+), indicating a recent sharp increase in relative strength.

The high RSI value suggests the stock is overbought, raising concerns about potential near-term correction.  However, the positive PPO and strong relative strength change counter this to an extent.  The current price of $320.01, significantly above the moving averages, supports the recent sharp upward movement.  The expected return of 0.1% over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years) is significantly below the historical performance, suggesting caution. This low figure is likely a reflection of the inherent risk and volatility associated with the cryptocurrency market.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The recent earnings show significant volatility. The May 2024 quarter shows exceptionally high EPS, which needs further investigation for any one-off or unusual accounting practices.  Overall, there's significant fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  Further analysis of these earnings, including a comparison to analyst expectations, is necessary.


**5. Financial Information (Revenue & Profitability and Capital & Profitability):**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  The data shows a general trend of decreasing revenue from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024, with high profit margins throughout the periods. However, further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the revenue decline and the impact on future profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** The ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates wildly, suggesting high volatility and inconsistency in profitability.  A more in-depth analysis, including consideration of leverage and asset composition, is needed.

**7. Overall Analysis (Summary of Points 1-6):**

COIN has shown strong performance compared to the S&P 500 but with significant volatility.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially overbought market, despite strong recent upward momentum.  Financial performance is highly erratic.  The high beta and fluctuating profitability suggest high risk.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough examination of the recent earnings report (including analyst expectations), news, and overall market conditions for cryptocurrencies is crucial.  The seemingly inconsistent financial performance suggests the need for a deeper dive into the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future prospects.  Furthermore, the dependence on cryptocurrency market conditions introduces a level of risk not present in more traditional investments.
