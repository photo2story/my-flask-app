2025-01-12 - Analysis Report
## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return for COIN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 136.07%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 38.71%
* **Return Difference:** 97.4%
* **Relative Divergence:** 68.9% (This indicates COIN's performance is in the top 68.9% percentile relative to its historical performance compared to VOO).

The provided CAGR data shows consistently high returns for COIN, significantly outperforming the benchmark. However,  the high Alpha values (though reported as -0.0, which needs further investigation for accuracy) and Beta suggest high volatility and market sensitivity.  The large Maximum Drawdown (MDD) further supports this observation, highlighting the considerable risk associated with COIN.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $258.78
* **5-day Moving Average:** $268.31
* **20-day Moving Average:** $279.36
* **60-day Moving Average:** $269.03

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  However, a definitive trend cannot be established with limited data.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 42.05 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so.)
* **PPO:** -0.89 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.3 (Indicates a short-term upward trend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -4.5% (This suggests a potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. This number should be viewed with caution and considered in the context of the high volatility of COIN).

The current price of $258.78, being below the moving averages, doesn't necessarily indicate a sharp drop or rebound. Further analysis is needed to determine if this is a consolidation phase or a continuation of a bearish trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicates (2024-10-30 appears twice).  There appears to be significant fluctuation in EPS and revenue, possibly indicating volatile profitability.  The high revenue figures in Q1 and Q2 2024 are notable, but need further investigation given the inconsistencies.  A more reliable dataset is needed for a proper analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with significant volatility and risk.  The data suggests a potential short-term bearish trend, but long-term prospects are uncertain, especially given the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 and inconsistent financial performance.  The provided data inconsistencies require further investigation before drawing definitive conclusions.  A more complete and consistent dataset, including more detailed financial statements and a clearer understanding of the reported Alpha values, is necessary for a thorough and reliable analysis.
