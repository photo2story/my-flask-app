However, the high Beta values suggest substantial market sensitivity.  The Alpha values fluctuate around zero, indicating COIN's performance isn't consistently outperforming the market after adjusting for risk.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While Q1 2024 showed strong performance, recent quarters have seen a decline. The inconsistent performance raises concerns about the company's financial stability and predictability.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3   | $1.21 B     |

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

COIN has shown exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500 in the past, but recent performance and indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The high Beta highlights significant market risk. While the RSI indicates oversold conditions, potentially signaling a short-term bounce, the negative PPO, declining revenue, and volatile earnings raise significant concerns.  The -2.9% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a cautionary sign.  Further fundamental analysis and consideration of the cryptocurrency market's overall outlook are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data provided contains inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) which needs to be addressed for a more robust analysis.
