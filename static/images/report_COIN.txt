## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a publicly traded American cryptocurrency exchange.  The cumulative return of COIN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last data point, COIN's cumulative return is 171.78%, while VOO's is 48.68%. This represents a difference of 123.1 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 80.2% indicates that COIN's performance is considerably above the S&P 500, considering the historical range of divergence.  The high alpha values in the provided table further support this outperformance, particularly in the later periods. However, the beta is quite high which indicates the high sensitivity to the market's overall movements.


**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | 43.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 62.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 218.0% | 24.9% | 155.0% | 74.6 |

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across all periods indicates strong growth.  However, the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) also demonstrates significant risk.  The consistently high alpha values imply that COIN's returns exceed what would be expected based solely on market movements.  The increasing beta signifies increasing market sensitivity over time.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $298.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $295.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $273.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $280.26

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, but the recent price increase could mean a potential temporary deviation from a longer term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.51 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.60 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +4.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -2.7% (Compared to S&P 500)


The RSI is near overbought territory, indicating potential for a price correction.  The positive PPO and upward relative divergence support the short-term upward trend. However, the negative expected return suggests that COIN is expected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term (2 years or more), even with its recent strong showing. The price change of $0.67 (0.23%) from the previous close is not significant enough to signal a sudden sharp upward or downward move.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30   | $1.21B       |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15   | $1.45B       |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84   | $1.64B       |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01  | $0.67B       |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01  | $0.67B       |

Earnings are volatile, with significant swings in both EPS and revenue.  The high EPS in Q2 2024 is a noteworthy outlier.  The data seems to contain an error as the same date (2024-10-30) and financial data shows up twice.  Further investigation into the reliability and accuracy of this data is required.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.67B | 61.01%       |

Revenue shows a general upward trend, although there's volatility. Profit margins are consistently high, indicating strong profitability.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86% |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35% |
| 2023-09-30 | $5.92B | -0.04% |

Equity is growing, but ROE (Return on Equity) is volatile, suggesting variability in profitability relative to shareholder equity.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in the short-term.  However, the high beta indicates substantial risk, and the long-term expected return is negative compared to the market.  Earnings are volatile, but profitability is consistently high.  Technical indicators suggest a short-term upward trend, but the RSI is approaching overbought levels, signaling a potential correction.  The provided earnings data shows inconsistencies that need clarification.  Investors should exercise caution and consider the high risk associated with COIN before making investment decisions.  Further research and due diligence are critical before considering any investment in COIN.
