2025-01-26 - Analysis Report
## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform providing a range of services for buying, selling, transferring, and storing cryptocurrencies.

The cumulative return of COIN (171.78%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (27.08%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 144.7%, placing it at the 81.8th percentile of the historical range of divergence (max: 189.8%, min: -57.7%). This indicates COIN's substantial outperformance relative to the broader market.  However, this high divergence should be viewed with caution, as it suggests a potential for mean reversion.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), reflecting strong growth, but also high Maximum Drawdown (MDD), indicating significant volatility.  The alpha is reported as 0.0 across all periods, which might be due to limitations in the calculation method or the data used.  The beta, however, is significantly higher than 1, suggesting that COIN is considerably more volatile than the market (S&P 500).  The increasing Beta values over time indicate growing market sensitivity.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 0.0 | 43.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 0.0 | 62.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 218.0% | 24.9% | 0.0 | 74.6 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $298.0
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $295.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $273.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $280.26

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an uptrend.  However, the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average might indicate a potential short-term consolidation or slight correction.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 67.51 -  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.60 - Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +4.4 - Shows short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** -1.1% - This indicates a negative expected return compared to the overall market, which may be impacted by the overall uncertainty of the crypto-market.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500, considering this is a growth sector still establishing itself, may be much higher.  But this should not be read as a guarantee.

The recent price change (0.67%) is not significant enough to be classified as a sharp uptrend or downtrend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  While there were periods of substantial EPS and revenue growth, there are also instances of significant losses.  The most recent quarter (2024-10-30) shows a decreased revenue compared to the previous quarter, which should be looked at.  Further investigation into the reasons for this volatility is needed.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30 | $1.21B       |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15 | $1.45B       |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84 | $1.64B       |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01| $0.67B       |

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information reveals high profit margins but fluctuating profitability and equity.  ROE (Return on Equity) is inconsistent, highlighting the volatility of the business. The significant drop in revenue from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024 is notable and requires further analysis to understand the underlying factors.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B   | 71.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B   | 74.99%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B   | 76.16%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B   | 71.13%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.67B   | 61.01%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE     |
|------------|----------|---------|

| 2023-09-30 | $5.92B   | -0.04%  |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown remarkable growth exceeding the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by high volatility and risk.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity. While recent price action is positive, technical indicators signal potential near-term correction.  Earnings show inconsistency, and deeper investigation into the causes of volatility is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high profit margins are positive, but the fluctuating ROE and revenue raises concerns.  Long-term investors might consider COIN's potential for growth in the cryptocurrency sector, but should be prepared for substantial price swings.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment is strongly advised.  Consider the high risk before investing.
