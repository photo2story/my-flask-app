**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return of COIN significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) by 28.5 percentage points. This places COIN at the 46.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, suggesting a relatively strong performance, considering its historical volatility.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 45.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 114.0% | -0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 79.0% | 74.8% | 68.0% | -0.0 | 44.4 |

*Note: Alpha values appear to be incorrect.  Alpha is typically a measure of excess return relative to the market (beta represents market sensitivity); an alpha of near zero indicates performance closely tracking the market, contradicting the significant outperformance shown in the cumulative return comparison.  This requires further investigation.*  The high Beta values suggest significant market sensitivity, which is expected for a cryptocurrency-related company.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $175.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $174.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $177.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $219.99

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend in the short to medium term. The 5-day average is very close to the closing price, indicating recent price stability.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 50.60 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.33 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +1.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -6.5% (This suggests COIN is expected to underperform the S&P 500 over the long term by 6.5%, assuming current market conditions remain consistent. More investigation is needed to validate this estimation).

The recent price change of $1.64 shows a small positive movement; not a substantial "jump".


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30  | $1.21 B     |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15  | $1.45 B     |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84  | $1.64 B     |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01 | $0.67 B     |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01 | $0.67 B     | *(Duplicate entry - likely a data error)*

Earnings show significant volatility.  The May 2024 EPS is exceptionally high compared to other periods.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers behind this fluctuation and whether itâ€™s a one-off event or a trend.  The duplicated entry needs correction.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.27B | 75.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13% |

Revenue and profit margins generally show a healthy trend.  However, the significant drop in revenue in Q3 2024 warrants attention.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.28B | 12.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86% |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35% |

Equity growth is substantial, but ROE fluctuates considerably, indicating potential issues with profitability consistency.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the measured period, however, this needs to be considered within the context of higher volatility.  The provided data reveals inconsistencies (especially the Alpha values and duplicate earnings entry) which need clarification.  While recent financial performance indicates strong revenue and profit margins, there's significant volatility in both earnings and ROE. The short-term price movement suggests a possible downward trend, while longer-term projections indicate potential underperformance against the S&P 500 (-6.5% expected return).  A deeper dive into the drivers of the earnings volatility and a review of the discrepancies in the provided data are crucial before forming a conclusive opinion on the investment prospects of COIN.  Given the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrency investments, a thorough due diligence process is recommended before any investment decision is made.
