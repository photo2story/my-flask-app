## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The following analysis summarizes key performance indicators and recent trends.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 40.52%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 12.05%
* **Return Difference:** 28.47%
* **Relative Deviation:** 46.4% (This indicates COIN's performance is significantly higher than VOO, sitting in the upper 46.4% percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO.  It does *not* imply a 46.4% outperformance.)

The provided data shows COIN significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the measured period. However,  the historical max and min deviations suggest significant volatility.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 45.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 114.0% | -0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 79.0% | 74.8% | 68.0% | -0.0 | 44.4 |

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values demonstrate strong growth, however, the substantial MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights significant risk.  A beta near zero suggests low correlation with the overall market, meaning its price movements are not heavily influenced by broader market trends.  The Alpha values seem unusually high, which might be due to data limitations or calculation errors.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $175.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $174.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $177.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $219.99

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend. The significant difference between the current price and the 60-day moving average indicates a more substantial decline over the past two months. The recent price increase (Last-market data showing a $1.64 increase) shows a slight upward momentum, but it's too early to determine if this is a sustainable trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4223 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 50.60 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.33 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Deviation Change:** +1.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -6.5% (This suggests a potential negative return over a longer term compared to the market.  However, without more details about the calculation methodology this result needs further context.)

The indicators present a mixed picture.  While RSI is neutral, PPO and the relative deviation suggest upward momentum. The negative expected return warrants caution.  The recent price increase of $1.64 indicates a small but noticeable upward movement, not enough to indicate a 'sharp rebound'.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30    | $1.21B        |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15    | $1.45B        |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84    | $1.64B        |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01   | $0.67B        |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01   | $0.67B        |

There's significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  The exceptionally high EPS in Q2 2024 needs further investigation to understand the underlying factors.  The negative EPS in two quarters suggests periods of losses.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.27B | 75.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.28B | 12.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86% |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35% |


The financial information shows high profit margins and relatively strong ROE (Return on Equity) in certain quarters, indicating a potentially profitable business. However, the substantial quarter-to-quarter fluctuations highlight significant volatility and the need for further analysis to understand the underlying drivers.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Coinbase (COIN) has demonstrated strong growth relative to the S&P 500, but this growth comes with considerable volatility and risk.  The high CAGR is tempered by a substantial MDD and inconsistent earnings.  While the recent price movement shows a slight upward trend, the technical indicators present a mixed signal.  The high profit margins are positive but the significant fluctuations raise concerns about sustainability.  Further detailed analysis, including a deeper dive into the drivers of the Q2 2024 EPS surge and the reasons for significant quarter-to-quarter variance in revenue and profitability, is crucial before making any investment decisions. The negative expected return against the S&P 500 over the long term suggests caution, and the investor should carefully consider their risk tolerance.
