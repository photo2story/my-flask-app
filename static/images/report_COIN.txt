* **Closing Price:** $278.71
* **5-day Moving Average:** $291.89
* **20-day Moving Average:** $306.70
* **60-day Moving Average:** $250.41

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (42.98):**  Approaching oversold territory (below 50), potentially indicating a short-term bounce but not a strong buy signal.
* **PPO (-2.80):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (-11.0):** Shows a recent downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (51.3%):**  Indicates significant long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500, *assuming* this trend continues.  This is a high estimate and should be viewed cautiously.  The current price of $278.71 is below recent moving averages, suggesting a possible near-term correction might adjust this expectation downward.  A sharp price drop is a distinct possibility.
