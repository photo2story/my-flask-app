**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.

| Metric                     | COIN   | VOO     | Difference | Relative Difference |
|-----------------------------|--------|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Cumulative Return (%)       | 104.47 | 43.80   | 60.67       | 52.8%                |


The provided alpha/beta analysis shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)  and significant alpha in some periods, indicating outperformance compared to the market (though the 2021-2023 alpha is 0, suggesting market-aligned performance in that specific period).  High beta values signify higher volatility compared to the market.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 150.0% | 24.9% | 92.0% | 0.1 | 57.6 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $227.07
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $248.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $273.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $283.79

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent closing price shows a significant drop (-$3.53 or -1.5%) from the previous close, indicating a potential short-term downward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 29.44 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce)
* **PPO:** -2.05 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -16.6% (Short-term bearish divergence)

The significant price drop of -$3.53 reflects a notable negative change.  Given the current market conditions and the indicators, the expected return is -3.5% in the short term.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is difficult to predict precisely without a more comprehensive model but the high historical CAGR and significant outperformance in some periods suggest potential for continued outperformance, albeit with considerable volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30  | $1.21B        |

| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01 | $0.67B        |

Earnings are highly volatile.  Note the discrepancy in the Oct 30th data â€“ likely a data entry error needs clarification.  The significant jump in EPS in Q2 2024 needs investigation to understand the underlying factors.

COIN has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500 in the past,  but current market conditions show a bearish trend.

The high profit margins and increasing equity are positive signs, but inconsistencies in earnings data require further investigation and clarification.  Investors should monitor key metrics closely and consider diversifying their portfolio to mitigate risk.  A thorough examination of the inconsistent data points in the earnings reports is crucial before making any investment decisions.
