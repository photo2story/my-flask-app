## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Coinbase Global, Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  This report analyzes COIN's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), using provided financial and technical indicators to assess its current status and potential future performance.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Coinbase's cumulative return (89.59%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (35.51%) over the analyzed period.  The current divergence of 54.1% places it in the 49.9th percentile of its historical range of divergence (max 168.3%, min -59.7%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures across the periods, indicating strong growth, but also significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  The alpha values suggest periods of outperformance (positive alpha) and underperformance (negative alpha) relative to the market, while the high beta values indicate significant market sensitivity.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 135.0% | 25.3% | 86.0% | 0.1 | 54.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

COIN's closing price is $212.55, a 3.30% increase from the previous close.  The price is below both its 5-day ($211.05) and 20-day ($250.25) moving averages, indicating a possible short-term downtrend.  It's further below the 60-day moving average ($274.51), suggesting a more sustained downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (31.36):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-2.19):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (2.4,+):** Shows a short-term upward trend in relative strength.  However, this should be interpreted cautiously in light of the negative PPO and lower prices relative to moving averages.
* **Expected Return (-3.0%):**  This suggests an expected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), even with a long-term buy-and-hold strategy.  The recent price increase, though positive, is not sufficient to counteract this long-term outlook.

The significant price increase from the previous close (3.30%) could be a short-term rebound and should be viewed within the context of the overall downtrend indicated by the moving averages.  This requires further investigation of the underlying causes of this price jump.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant variability.  While Q2 2024 shows exceptionally high EPS, other quarters show mixed results, including negative EPS.  Revenue generally appears to be trending upwards, but this needs further analysis to determine if it's sustainable.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3 | 1.21 B$ |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15 | 1.45 B$ |

| 2023-11-02 | -0.01 | 0.67 B$ |
| 2024-10-30 | -0.01 | 0.67 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has been fluctuating but mostly increasing.  Profit margins are consistently high (above 70%), suggesting strong profitability.  Equity has generally increased, but ROE (Return on Equity) is inconsistent, indicating potential volatility in profitability.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.27B | 75.56% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has shown periods of significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial risk as indicated by high betas and MDDs. While recent price action suggests a potential short-term bounce, the current indicators and long-term expected return suggest caution.  The inconsistent earnings and ROE highlight the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market and COIN's dependence on it.  Further investigation into the drivers of revenue growth and the sustainability of high profit margins is necessary before making investment decisions.  Investors should carefully consider the risks associated with COIN before investing.
