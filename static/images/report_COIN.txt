## COIN (Coinbase Global Inc) Stock Analysis

**1. Relative Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc (COIN), a cryptocurrency exchange platform, significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  The cumulative return for COIN is 187.75%, while the S&P 500 returned 47.47%, resulting in a difference of 140.28%. The relative overperformance is high (87.7 on a scale of 100, relative to historical data).

Alpha and Beta analysis reveals high alpha (excess return compared to the benchmark) and near-zero beta (correlation with the market), suggesting that COIN's returns are driven by factors independent of the broader market.  However, the negative beta in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 is unusual and warrants further investigation.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is attractive, but the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates substantial volatility.


**2. Recent Price Action:**

COIN's recent price action shows slight weakness. The current price ($303.80) is below the last closing price ($311.64) and slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages ($312.86 and $312.06, respectively).  However, it is significantly above the 60-day moving average ($245.18), indicating a positive medium-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

**7. Summary:**

COIN has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by high alpha. However, its recent performance shows some weakness, with declining revenue and volatile profitability. While the high profit margins are positive, the declining revenue and volatile ROE raise concerns. Technical indicators suggest neither overbought nor oversold conditions but weakening momentum.  Further research into recent news and analyst opinions is essential before making any investment decisions.  Clarification is needed on duplicate entries in the earnings table.  The negative beta values are unusual and should be investigated further.


**8. Recommendation:**

Further investigation is required before making any investment decision.  The conflicting signals from strong past performance, declining revenue, volatile profitability, and unusual negative beta require careful consideration. Pay close attention to upcoming earnings reports and analyst opinions for clearer direction.  The high MDD indicates considerable risk, making it crucial to understand the volatility inherent in this investment.
