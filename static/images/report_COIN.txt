**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The analysis shows COIN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period, with a cumulative return of 138.27% compared to VOO's 49.00%.  The relative divergence of 65.4% suggests that this outperformance is relatively high compared to historical performance relative to VOO.  However, the expected long-term return is negative compared to the S&P 500.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 184.0% | 24.9% | 121.0% | 0.1 | 67.2 |

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values indicate strong growth, although the Alpha values suggest that a significant portion of this growth might not be attributable to market performance (potentially due to idiosyncratic factors or the risk involved in cryptocurrency).  The relatively low Beta values suggest less sensitivity to overall market movements compared to the S&P 500. The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values however point to considerable risk associated with COIN. Note that there appears to be an inconsistency in the Alpha values compared to the overall return difference.  Further investigation into the methodology used for calculating Alpha is recommended.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($264.63) is below all three moving averages (5-day: $275.77, 20-day: $283.57, 60-day: $288.24), suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (43.78):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but is leaning towards the oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.47):** Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change (-7.1%):**  Shows a recent decline in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30  | $1.21 B        |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15  | $1.45 B        |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84  | $1.64 B        |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01 | $0.67 B        |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01 | $0.67 B        |


There's significant volatility in EPS and Revenue. The unusually high EPS in May 2024 requires further investigation to determine the cause.  The data for October 2024 is duplicated and should be clarified.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing data is a critical gap and needs to be addressed.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase (COIN) has shown exceptional growth compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with significant volatility and risk (high MDD).  Current technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) suggest a bearish short-term trend.  The inconsistent Alpha values and missing financial data necessitate further investigation before drawing definitive conclusions. The high expected long-term loss compared to VOO warrants careful consideration.  Investors should be aware of the inherent risks in the cryptocurrency market and the company's dependence on cryptocurrency market conditions.  Additional financial information is crucial for a more thorough assessment.
