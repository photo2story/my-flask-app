## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The following analysis is based on the provided data, which has limitations due to missing key financial information (see section 5).

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 62.47%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 19.88%
* **Return Difference:** 42.6%
* **Relative Divergence:** 53.6% (This indicates COIN's performance is significantly above the S&P 500,  falling within the upper 53.6% of its historical divergence range against the S&P 500.)

The provided CAGR data shows COIN significantly outperforming the market over various periods. However, the high maximum drawdown (MDD) indicates considerable risk.  The near-zero alpha suggests its returns are largely correlated with the market (high beta), with potentially limited additional return (alpha) beyond market movements.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 0.0   | 44.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 0.0   | 63.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 101.0% | 74.8% | 0.0   | 52.2 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $204.93
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $204.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $184.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $205.26

The price is slightly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend, but above the 20-day moving average which could be interpreted as somewhat bullish.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 75.98 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term correction)
* **PPO:** 2.06 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.0% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -3.8% (Long-term negative expected return compared to the S&P 500)

The high RSI and negative expected return raise concerns about potential near-term price corrections.  The relatively high PPO still signals momentum, however.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicate entries.  Analyzing this data requires clarification and a consistent data set.  Without a clear picture of revenue trends, meaningful analysis is not possible.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-05-08 | 0.26 | 2.03 B$     |
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3  | 1.21 B$     |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15 | 1.45 B$     |
| 2024-05-02 | 4.84 | 1.64 B$     |
| 2025-05-08 | 4.84 | 1.64 B$     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of crucial financial data like Total Revenue and Gross Profit significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  Without this data, assessing the company's financial health and long-term prospects is impossible.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown impressive returns exceeding the S&P 500,  but this comes with substantial risk (high beta and MDD).  The current technical indicators suggest potential short-term corrections.  However,  the crucial missing financial information prevents a conclusive assessment of its long-term prospects.  A more detailed and reliable financial data set is needed for a more informed investment decision.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk and volatility inherent in cryptocurrency-related investments. The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 is a significant concern.
