## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return of COIN is 145.45%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 45.56%. The difference is 99.89%, placing it at the 85.71st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  While this shows strong relative performance, the high relative volatility (max: 126.92, min: -62.29) should be noted.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -47.0%  | 76.7%  | -82.0% | 2.8   | 35.6   |
| 2022-2024  | 17.6%   | 70.5%  | -12.0% | 3.0   | 65.6   |

The high beta (2.8-3.0) indicates significant volatility and correlation with the overall market. Negative alpha in 2021-2023 suggests underperformance relative to market expectations, but positive alpha in 2022-2024 shows improved performance relative to the benchmark.  Note that these are backward-looking figures.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 295.23
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 314.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 257.68
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 203.54

The price is above the 20 and 60-day moving averages but below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term pullback from a recent peak.  The 295.29 (Last-market) price is close to the closing price, indicating minimal change between the last market price and closing price.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 71.32 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.85 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** 34.38 (+) (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.23% (Long-term S&P 500 outperformance)

The RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, warranting caution. The PPO confirms upward momentum, but the RSI suggests potential for a correction. The positive relative divergence supports the short-term bullish trend.  The 0.23% expected return is a long-term projection and should be considered within the context of overall market risk.  The fact that the last market price (295.29) is very close to the closing price does not suggest any dramatic recent price swings (like a sharp uptrend or downtrend).

**4. Recent Financials:**

| Date        | EPS   | Revenue     |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30  | 0.3   | 1.21 B$     |
| 2024-08-01  | 0.15  | 1.45 B$     |
| 2024-05-02  | 4.84  | 1.64 B$     |
| 2023-11-02  | -0.01 | 0.67 B$     |
| 2024-10-30  | -0.01 | 0.67 B$     |

There's significant volatility in EPS and revenue.  The most recent earnings (0.3 EPS and $1.21B revenue) shows a substantial improvement in profit compared to the previous quarter but still exhibits fluctuations. Further analysis is needed to determine if the high EPS in 2024-05-02 is sustainable or anomalous.  A comparison with analyst expectations for the latest quarter would provide a more complete picture.

**6. Financial Statements Analysis:**

**1) Revenue and Profitability:**  High profit margins are evident across the quarters, indicating strong profitability. However, there's a decline in revenue from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024.

**2) Capital and Profitability:** ROE is highly volatile, ranging from a negative value to over 14%.  This volatility is typical for a high-growth company operating in the cryptocurrency market.
