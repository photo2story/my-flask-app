2025-04-22 - Analysis Report
## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform offering a range of services for buying, selling, and trading digital assets.  This report analyzes COIN's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key financial indicators, and earnings data.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 40.48%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 9.67%
* **Return Difference:** 30.81%
* **Relative Divergence:** 47.6% (Indicates COIN's performance is significantly higher than VOO, sitting at the 47.6th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO's performance.  This is not necessarily indicative of future outperformance.)

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis show high CAGR figures, particularly over the 2022-2024 period. However,  the Alpha consistently remains at or near 0, suggesting COIN's returns are largely explained by market movements (high Beta values support this).  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) highlights the significant risk associated with investing in COIN.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 0.0% | 44.2 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 0.0% | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 79.0% | 74.8% | 0.0% | 44.4 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $175.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $174.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $176.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $217.97

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates limited recent volatility.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 51.55 (Slightly above neutral; not significantly overbought or oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.38 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -6.1% (Negative short-term expected return)
* **Long-Term Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):**  The provided data doesn't directly give a long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500. This would require more sophisticated forecasting models considering various factors beyond the scope of this report.  However, given the high volatility and dependence on market sentiment (demonstrated by the Beta), long-term outperformance is not guaranteed. The recent price decline of -$0.02 does not reflect a significant market event.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While some quarters show strong revenue figures, profitability has fluctuated considerably. The large EPS figure in 2024-05-02 is an outlier that warrants further investigation for unusual items affecting the earnings report.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30 | $1.21B       |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15 | $1.45B       |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84 | $1.64B       |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01| $0.67B       |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01| $0.67B       |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue has shown variability, although the profit margins are consistently high, generally exceeding 70%. The equity shows an upward trend, however the Return on Equity (ROE) is inconsistent, indicating fluctuations in profitability relative to the invested capital.  Further analysis is required to understand the drivers behind these fluctuations.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.27B | 75.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.28B | 12.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86% |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase's performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500 over the periods analyzed, but this comes with considerable volatility and risk.  The high Beta indicates strong correlation with market movements. While recent price action shows a bearish trend, the positive PPO suggests some underlying bullish momentum. The company demonstrates high profit margins but inconsistent profitability and ROE, requiring further investigation into the underlying drivers of these fluctuations.  A long-term investment requires a thorough understanding of the cryptocurrency market's inherent risks and COIN's dependence on its performance.  The -6.1% short-term expected return suggests caution.  More detailed financial modeling is needed to provide a robust long-term forecast of its performance relative to the S&P 500.
