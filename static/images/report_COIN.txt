**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return of COIN (60.06%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a negative cumulative return of -4.19%. The difference is substantial (64.25%), indicating COIN's strong performance relative to the broader market.  However, the relative divergence of 37.4% suggests this outperformance isn't entirely unprecedented historically.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 132.0% | 79.1% | 121.0% | -0.1 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 171.0% | 99.7% | 155.0% | -0.1 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 51.0% | 99.7% | 49.0% | -0.2 | 40.8 |

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across all periods reflects strong growth, albeit with substantial maximum drawdown (MDD).  Negative alpha values suggest COIN underperformed its benchmark adjusted for risk (beta).  High beta values, particularly in 2022-2024, indicate substantial price volatility relative to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $160.55
* **Previous Close:** $170.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $172.20
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $184.40
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $235.61

The closing price is below all three moving averages, indicating a possible downtrend.  The recent price drop of $5.98 (Last-market data) shows a significant negative change, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.6333 (High Risk) - Suggests increased market volatility.
* **RSI:** 35.37 (Below 40, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.31 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 54.1% (Over two years, exceeding S&P 500 returns)


The conflicting signals from RSI (oversold) and PPO (bearish) warrant caution.  The recent price drop of $5.98 (-3.5%) does not appear to be a dramatic change for COIN, but it contributes to the bearish momentum.  The high expected return should be interpreted with caution given the high-risk MRI.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출       |
|------------|---------|------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30   | $1.21B     |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15   | $1.45B     |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84   | $1.64B     |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01  | $0.67B     |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01  | $0.67B     |

Earnings show significant volatility.  The exceptionally high EPS in Q2 2024 ($4.84) is an outlier, requiring further investigation.  Revenue has generally been consistent, excluding Q4 2023's low point.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |

| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B      | 14.57%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B      | 4.35%         |

Revenue and profit margins are generally high and stable. However, ROE fluctuates significantly, suggesting inconsistent profitability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with high growth potential indicated by a high expected return.  However, the high risk indicator (MRI), negative PPO, price action below moving averages, and volatile earnings/ROE warrant caution. The substantial recent price drop and generally high beta value signal high volatility.  Further investigation into the outlier Q2 2024 EPS and the reasons for ROE fluctuations is crucial.  While the long-term outlook might be positive based on the high expected return, investors should be aware of the significant short-term risk and volatility associated with COIN.  A thorough understanding of the cryptocurrency market and Coinbase's specific business model is crucial before making any investment decisions.
