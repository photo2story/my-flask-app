Over the analyzed period, COIN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (represented by VOO), with a cumulative return 12.2% higher than VOO's.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 72.0% | 59.1% | 71.0% | 0.0 | 45.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 117.0% | 79.2% | 95.0% | 0.0 | 65.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 82.0% | 79.2% | 41.0% | 0.1 | 46.0 |

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across the periods indicates strong growth.  However, the significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values highlight the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market and COIN's exposure to it.  The alpha values exceeding 40% in all periods signify substantial outperformance against a benchmark (although the beta near zero suggests low correlation with the market).

* **5-day Moving Average:** $180.64
* **20-day Moving Average:** $191.40
* **60-day Moving Average:** $240.75

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent jump to $181.35 shows a potential short-term bullish reversal, but further observation is needed to confirm a trend change.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.64 (approaching oversold territory)

* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -9.7% (short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 0.4% (over 2 years)  This indicates a modest outperformance potential compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. The recent price increase of 3.91% from the previous close suggests a potential short-term bullish reversal, warranting further monitoring.

While the data suggests long-term outperformance potential relative to the S&P 500, investors should be prepared for significant price swings.  Further due diligence, including a deeper analysis of the Q2 2024 earnings anomaly, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
