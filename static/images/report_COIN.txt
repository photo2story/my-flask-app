## Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The following analysis provides a comprehensive overview of its recent performance against the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 41.38%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 11.28%
* **Return Difference:** 30.1% (COIN outperformed VOO by 30.1 percentage points).
* **Relative Divergence:** 46.6% (COIN's performance is in the 47th percentile relative to its historical performance vs VOO, based on a range of -61.9% to 135.4%).  This suggests COIN's current outperformance is moderately strong compared to its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures show significant variability over the periods.  High CAGR numbers are offset by equally high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).  Alpha is consistently close to zero, suggesting that COIN's returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta is significantly greater than 1).  Beta values, indicating sensitivity to market fluctuations, are high across all three periods.  This implies high risk.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 47.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 116.0% | 0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 80.0% | 74.8% | 69.0% | -0.0 | 44.6 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $175.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $166.19
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $179.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $227.78

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase (Last-market: +3.47) shows a small bounce, but needs further confirmation to signal a trend reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.96 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.63 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but needs to be interpreted in context with the price action and other indicators)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.4 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -6.0% (COIN is expected to underperform the S&P 500 by 6% over the long term, based on current projections).  This is a significant underperformance, suggesting caution. The recent price increase of 3.47 should be considered in the context of this long-term negative projection.  It's a short-term bounce in a longer-term bearish outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility and inconsistency.  While some quarters show high EPS and revenue, others exhibit losses. This unpredictability highlights the inherent risk associated with COIN.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3   | $1.21 B       |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15  | $1.45 B       |
| 2024-05-02 | 4.84  | $1.64 B       |
| 2023-11-02 | -0.01 | $0.67 B       |
| 2024-10-30 | -0.01 | $0.67 B       | *(Duplicate data point, likely an error)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, with high profit margins. However, equity and ROE fluctuate significantly, signaling operational instability and risk.

| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown periods of strong outperformance against the S&P 500, but this is coupled with significant volatility and high risk (as indicated by high Beta and MDD).  While recent earnings show high profit margins, the inconsistency in EPS and revenue, along with fluctuating equity and ROE, suggests considerable operational instability.  The negative expected return (-6%) against the S&P 500 over the long term presents a significant concern.  The recent small price bounce is not enough to alter this long-term bearish outlook.  Investors should proceed with caution and carefully consider the inherent risks before investing in COIN.  Diversification within a well-defined investment strategy is highly recommended.  Further investigation into the causes of the earnings volatility and the factors driving the high Beta are necessary for a more informed investment decision.
