## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:**

Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  This report analyzes COIN's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), its recent price movements, key financial indicators, and recent earnings.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500.

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 62.07%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 17.75%
* **Return Difference:** 44.3%
* **Relative Divergence:** 54.5% (This indicates COIN's performance is in the upper 54.5th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO.)

The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta data shows high volatility and strong performance over varying periods:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 45.0% | -0.0 | 44.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 114.0% | -0.0 | 63.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 100.0% | 74.8% | 83.0% | -0.0 | 51.7 |

While the CAGR is impressively high, the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights significant risk associated with COIN investment.  The near-zero Alpha suggests that the outperformance is largely due to high Beta (market sensitivity), rather than unique management skill.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $202.89
* **Previous Close:** $206.13
* **Change:** -$1.57 (-0.76%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $205.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $181.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $207.75

The price is slightly below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, and considerably above its 20-day moving average, suggesting recent consolidation after a period of growth.  The recent price drop is relatively small and may not signify a significant trend reversal.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3721 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 69.92 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.74 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -3.9% (Short-term expectation)
* **Long-Term S&P 500 Outperformance:**  The provided data does not directly address long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500 beyond the CAGR figures which show significant outperformance in specific periods.  More data would be needed to make a definitive prediction.  The high Beta suggests that the outperformance is strongly tied to overall market performance.

The recent price decrease of -$1.57 is relatively small and doesn't signal a significant shift.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30   | $1.21B         |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15   | $1.45B         |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84   | $1.64B         |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01  | $0.67B         |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01  | $0.67B         |

There's significant volatility in EPS and revenue. The May 2024 quarter shows exceptionally high EPS, which needs further investigation to understand the underlying factors.  A deeper dive into the financials is necessary to explain this fluctuation.  There appears to be a possible data error with two entries for October 30th, 2024.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.27B | 75.56%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE    |
|---------|---------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.28B | 12.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B  | 0.86%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B  | 0.43%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B  | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B  | 4.35%  |

Revenue and profit margins are generally high and stable.  However, ROE shows considerable volatility, suggesting fluctuating profitability and possibly significant reliance on external factors.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Coinbase shows strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, exhibiting high growth but also considerable risk (high Beta and MDD). Recent price action indicates consolidation, with indicators suggesting a near-term bullish trend but also approaching overbought conditions (RSI). Earnings show significant volatility, needing further investigation to understand the drivers. While the long-term outlook isn't explicitly addressed by the provided data, the high historical Beta indicates its performance is highly correlated to overall market conditions.  Further due diligence is required before making any investment decision, including investigation of the inconsistencies noted in the provided data.
