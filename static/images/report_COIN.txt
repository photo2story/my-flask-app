**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $320.57
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $311.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $304.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $225.19

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.  However, the significant gap between the 60-day and shorter-term averages indicates recent volatility. The last market price of $320.18 shows minimal difference to the closing price and does not indicate any significant sudden price changes.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.97 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.13 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** NaN (-), indicating a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 14.7% above the S&P 500. This is a long-term prediction and should be considered with caution given the high volatility of COIN.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both revenue and EPS.  While revenue generally increased, EPS fluctuated dramatically, including a substantial negative EPS in Q4 2023 and Q4 2024.  The large EPS in Q2 2024 is a significant outlier and needs further investigation beyond the data provided to understand the drivers.  Notably, there's a discrepancy between the provided Oct 30, 2024 entries with different reported figures.  Revenue showed an increase in Q2 2024 compared to Q1 2024, but then experienced a significant decrease in Q3 2024. There are inconsistencies requiring further data clarifications.

**Table 2: Recent Earnings Data**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3      | 1.21          |

Revenue has shown some fluctuation, with a peak in Q1 2024 followed by a decline in subsequent quarters. Profit margins are generally high but have also shown some variability. Equity has been increasing, but the Return on Equity (ROE) is highly volatile, indicating significant changes in profitability.  A deeper dive into the underlying causes of the ROE fluctuations is needed for a comprehensive analysis.
