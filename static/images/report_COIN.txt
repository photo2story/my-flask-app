## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

This report analyzes Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN), a cryptocurrency exchange platform, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase's cumulative return (129.36%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (41.61%).  The difference is 87.8%, placing it at the 64.7th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500, indicating relatively strong performance compared to its historical volatility against the benchmark.  However, this high relative percentile does not guarantee future outperformance.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) but also substantial maximum drawdown (MDD). The negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market, while the high beta indicates significant volatility correlated with the market.  The increasing Beta and CAGR from 2021-2023 to 2022-2024 shows a general trend toward increased risk and volatility, and potentially, higher returns.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $248.30
* **Last Market Price:** $256.85
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $264.72
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $295.30
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $259.73

The stock is trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The difference between the last market price and the closing price ($256.85 vs. $248.30) indicates a potential slight upward pressure, though not substantial considering the moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (27.24):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound, but it's not a guarantee.
* **PPO (-2.77):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-6.5):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-5.6%):**  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term suggests underperformance against the benchmark if the current trend continues.

**The last market price of $256.85 is higher than the closing price,** indicating a recent price increase, though this is minor in relation to the substantial differences to the moving averages. This does not suggest a significant "bounce" or dramatic price shift without further context.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility. Revenue was highest in Q1 2024 ($1.64B) and decreased in subsequent quarters.  EPS fluctuated wildly, with a significant jump to $4.84 in Q1 2024 followed by substantial decreases in subsequent quarters, showing significant inconsistency in profitability. There is no context provided for comparison to expectations, which would offer a deeper analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:** Shows a decline in recent quarters, with a noticeable dip in Q3 2023.
* **Profit Margin:** While generally high, it also fluctuates, suggesting inconsistencies in profitability.
* **Equity:** Shows overall growth, although there are some fluctuations.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):**  Highly volatile, suggesting inconsistent profitability and efficiency in utilizing shareholder equity.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **No recent (within 2 days) earnings news is explicitly provided in the dataset.**  Further information is needed to comment on market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase exhibits significant growth potential but also substantial risk. Its performance significantly exceeded the S&P 500 historically, but recent price action and technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) suggest a bearish trend.  Earnings data reveals highly volatile revenue and EPS, and financial information highlights significant fluctuations in profitability and return on equity.  The high beta indicates substantial market correlation and risk.  Without additional context (analyst expectations, market news, and specific factors driving the price changes), a definitive long-term outlook is difficult to provide.  The negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 raises concerns.  Further investigation into the causes of the earnings and price volatility is crucial before making any investment decisions.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the data, a cautious approach is advised.  Further research is needed to understand the reasons behind the earnings volatility and recent price decline.  Consider diversifying investments to mitigate risk. A long-term investment strategy, while potentially profitable given historical high growth, should account for the volatility inherent in this stock.  Consult a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
