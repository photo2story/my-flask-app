The table below shows CAGR, Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta and market capitalization.  Note that Alpha near 0 suggests the stock's performance is largely explained by market movements, while a Beta above 1 suggests higher volatility than the market.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 72.0% | 59.1% | 71.0% | 0.0 | 44.4 |
| 2022-2024  | 117.0% | 79.2% | 95.0% | 0.0 | 63.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 81.0% | 79.2% | 40.0% | 0.1 | 44.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $172.23
* **Last Market Price:** $173.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $186.58
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $193.30
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $242.13

The price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent slight increase from the previous close ($0.57) is minimal compared to the overall trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 39.15 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** 0.25 (Positive, but relatively low indicating weak momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -10.1% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 0.2% (This suggests a modest long-term outperformance of the S&P 500 over two years or more).  This figure needs clarification regarding its methodology.  A 0.2% expected return is extremely low and should be reviewed.

The small price increase is not a significant factor given the downtrend indicated by moving averages and other indicators.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue        |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30  | $1.21B         |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15  | $1.45B         |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84  | $1.64B         |

| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01 | $0.67B         |

Earnings are highly volatile.  The significant spike in EPS in Q2 2024 needs further investigation. The negative EPS figures in the earlier quarters are concerning.  Consistency and predictability in earnings are lacking.

| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16% |

| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B  | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B  | 4.35%  |

Equity has increased, indicating a strengthening financial position.  ROE shows significant volatility, highlighting the risk associated with the company.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has shown strong cumulative returns exceeding the S&P 500, but this outperformance is heavily influenced by volatility.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, and the earnings data reveals considerable inconsistency.  While the company shows high profit margins and increasing equity, the volatile nature of its earnings and price movements poses significant risk.  Investors should proceed with caution, carefully considering the risk tolerance before investing in COIN.  The provided expected return of 0.2% over the long term is exceptionally low and warrants further investigation into its calculation methodology. Further due diligence and a thorough understanding of the cryptocurrency market are crucial before making any investment decisions.
