2024-12-13 - Analysis Report
## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return for COIN is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns between COIN and VOO is 141.1%, placing it at the 88th percentile of historical divergence based on the provided data. This indicates that COIN's performance has substantially outpaced the S&P 500.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 44.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 219.0% | 34.8% | 179.0% | -0.0 | 79.0 |

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and significantly positive alpha indicate strong performance relative to the benchmark. However, the negative Beta in both periods is unusual and warrants further investigation.  Typically a negative beta indicates an inverse correlation to the market,  and it is quite unusual to see this consistent negative beta for two full years.  This negative beta might be an artifact of the short time-frame analyzed and the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market.  Further analysis with longer-term data is advised.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $309.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $235.53

The price is currently below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it is above the 20-day and significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.55  (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.62 (Slightly bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -7.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 41.7% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming continued performance and market conditions).
* **Market-Price Impact:** The last market price of $314.56 is relatively close to the closing price, so no significant recent jump or drop is evident.  The slight divergence between the closing and last market price requires additional data to properly interpret.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals significant volatility:

* **Revenue:** Shows significant fluctuation, peaking in Q1 2024 and then decreasing. This suggests market sensitivity and potentially cyclical business performance.
* **EPS:** Exhibits extreme volatility, with large positive and negative values across consecutive quarters. This signals inconsistency and substantial susceptibility to market forces.
* **Notable Points:**  There's a significant jump in EPS from Q2 2024 to Q1 2024, and substantial drop in revenue from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024.  The massive swing in both EPS and revenue warrants further investigation into the underlying business factors driving these fluctuations.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is highly volatile, while profit margins generally remain high but fluctuate considerably quarter-to-quarter.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has increased but the Return on Equity (ROE) is unstable, reflecting the volatile nature of the company’s performance. The significant jump in ROE in Q1 2024 needs to be investigated in terms of the underlying reasons for this sudden spike.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News:**  The provided earnings data is the most recent information available within the provided context.  Additional news sources are required to analyze very recent market outlooks and analyst opinions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has exhibited exceptionally high growth compared to the S&P 500, yet this performance is characterized by substantial volatility in both price and earnings. The negative beta is unusual and needs further analysis. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook, but the long-term outlook, based on the expected return, is significantly bullish. The high volatility underscores the inherent risks associated with the cryptocurrency market and Coinbase’s position within it.  The financial data indicates strong revenue and profitability in some quarters, but with inconsistent performance, making consistent investment predictions challenging.  Additional data, beyond what has been provided, is needed to thoroughly interpret the presented data.
