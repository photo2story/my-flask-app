## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), but with considerable volatility.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Coinbase's cumulative return (62.87%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's return (16.09%). The provided data shows a current gap of 46.8%, representing a relative deviation of 55.7% based on historical maximum and minimum deviations.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across the periods, suggesting strong growth, but also high Maximum Drawdown (MDD), indicating substantial risk. The near-zero Alpha suggests performance largely mirrors market movements (Beta), while the increasing Beta implies increasing market sensitivity over time.  The fluctuating Beta across the different periods suggests fluctuating market sensitivity over time.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 45.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 114.0% | -0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 101.0% | 74.8% | 86.0% | -0.0 | 51.8 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The closing price is $203.87,  a $4.66 increase from the previous close. This represents a significant daily jump.  The stock price is currently above its 5-day ($187.74) and 20-day ($175.88) moving averages, but below its 60-day ($213.49) moving average. This suggests potential short-term upward momentum, but a possible trend reversal in the longer term. The price sits below its 60-day average, suggesting a possible downward trend could be forming.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.4053 indicates a medium risk level.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 67.35 suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 2.92 indicates upward momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent increase in relative divergence (10.3%) further supports short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:**  The predicted return of -4.3% is concerning.  This negative value, paired with the high volatility in the historical data, must be considered seriously. The high risk and uncertainty around the cryptocurrency market itself should be acknowledged.  Long-term investment requires careful evaluation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's a notable jump in EPS and revenue in 2024 Q2, followed by a significant decrease in Q3 and a recovery in Q4. The extremely high Q2 figures are a significant outlier, potentially skewing the overall trend.  Further investigation into the cause of these variations is needed.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3 | 1.21 B$ |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15 | 1.45 B$ |
| 2024-05-02 | 4.84 | 1.64 B$ |
| 2023-11-02 | -0.01 | 0.67 B$ |
| 2024-10-30 | -0.01 | 0.67 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, although Q1 2024 represents a peak. Profit margins are consistently high, averaging above 70%.  However, Equity and ROE (Return on Equity) show volatility, particularly a significant drop in ROE in Q2 and Q3 of 2024 despite high revenue in those periods, suggesting inefficiencies or potential headwinds in profitability.  Further analysis is required to understand the factors driving these fluctuations.


| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.27B | 75.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13% |

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.28B | 12.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86% |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has demonstrated significant growth and outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with substantial volatility and risk. While recent price action suggests short-term upward momentum, the stock is currently below its 60-day moving average and nearing overbought territory (RSI).  The inconsistent earnings and ROE figures raise concerns about long-term sustainability. The negative expected return (-4.3%) warrants caution.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for high returns against the significant risks inherent in the cryptocurrency market and Coinbase's volatile performance.  A deeper dive into the causes of the fluctuations in EPS, ROE, and revenue is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further research into the macroeconomic factors affecting the cryptocurrency market is also recommended.
