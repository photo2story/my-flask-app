## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Investment Report

**1. Performance Overview and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  As of the last data point, COIN's cumulative return is 179.25%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 47.03%. The difference is 132.2%, placing it at the 84.1st percentile of the historical range of divergence between COIN and VOO.  While this indicates strong outperformance, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows substantial growth, though this is highly influenced by the volatility of the cryptocurrency market.  High Alpha values indicate superior performance compared to the benchmark, while Beta reflects the volatility relative to the market. The high Beta suggests COIN's price is highly sensitive to market fluctuations.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 46.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 209.0% | 34.8% | 170.0% | -0.0 | 79.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $302.42 (Last Market: $316.70)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $321.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $309.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $233.00

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend.  However, it's significantly above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential long-term strength. The drop from the last market price to the closing price reflects a recent downturn.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.65 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -1.57 (Negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.6% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 43.2% (This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term, consistent investment.)

The RSI and PPO indicators both signal bearish sentiment. The negative relative divergence change reinforces this.  The significant gap between the last market price ($316.70) and closing price implies a sharp recent decline, potentially due to market events not reflected in the provided data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals significant volatility in both revenue and EPS.

* **Revenue:** Shows inconsistency. While there's a peak in Q1 2024,  the subsequent quarters show decline.
* **EPS:**  Highly volatile, moving from substantial positive EPS in Q1 2024 to negative EPS in Q4 2023 and Q4 2024. This suggests a significant dependence on market conditions.  The substantial change in EPS between Q1 2024 and subsequent quarters is noteworthy and warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.
