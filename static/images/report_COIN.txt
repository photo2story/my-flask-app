## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  This report analyzes its recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and evaluating key financial metrics and indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Coinbase's cumulative return (55.71%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's return (13.78%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 41.9%, placing it at the 53.2nd percentile of its historical range (max: 133.7%, min: -62.6%).  While this indicates strong relative performance, the high volatility is notable.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 45.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 114.0% | -0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 94.0% | 74.8% | 81.0% | -0.0 | 49.5 |

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) demonstrates substantial growth, but the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights significant risk.  The near-zero alpha suggests the returns are largely explained by market movements (high beta). Market capitalization fluctuates considerably.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has demonstrated strong growth and outperformance against the S&P 500, particularly in the short term. However, this comes with considerable volatility and risk, as reflected in the high MDD, fluctuating earnings, and variable ROE.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, despite recent outperformance, warrants caution.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with this stock, given the cryptocurrency market's inherent volatility and Coinbase's dependence on it. Further investigation into the drivers of earnings and revenue fluctuations is crucial before making any investment decisions.
