## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return of COIN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last data point, COIN's cumulative return is 129.16%, while VOO's is 38.99%. This represents a difference of 90.2 percentage points. The relative divergence of 65.7% indicates that COIN's performance is in the upper 65.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this is a relative measure and doesn't imply consistent outperformance.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures for COIN, but also a high Maximum Drawdown (MDD).  The Alpha values are near zero, suggesting the returns are largely driven by market movements (Beta is high). Capitalization has increased, reflecting growth.  It's crucial to remember past performance doesn't guarantee future results.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 44.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | -0.0 | 62.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 175.0% | 24.9% | 122.0% | -0.0 | 63.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The closing price is $251.20.  The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day ($264.42), 20-day ($276.23), and 60-day ($269.94) moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (41.53):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.99):**  Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Divergence (-6.1%):**  Indicates a recent weakening in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-4.8%):** A negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) suggests underperformance compared to the market benchmark. The current price of $251.20, being below its moving averages, doesn't indicate any sharp upward or downward movements, but rather a consolidation phase after a period of decline.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings have been volatile.  While Q1 2024 showed strong EPS and revenue, subsequent quarters exhibit a decline in both.  The significant drop in revenue and EPS from Q1 to Q2 2024, and Q3 2024 is notable and warrants further investigation into underlying reasons.  A further investigation into specific factors affecting revenue and profit is required to fully understand the current earnings picture.


| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 0.3   | $1.21 B     |
| 2024-08-01 | 0.15  | $1.45 B     |
| 2024-05-02 | 4.84  | $1.64 B     |

| 2024-10-30 | -0.01 | $0.67 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has been declining since its peak in Q1 2024. Profit margins remain relatively high, though they have fluctuated. Equity has generally increased, but ROE (Return on Equity) has shown significant volatility, suggesting inconsistent profitability.  The significant drop in ROE between Q1 and Q2 2024 necessitates closer examination.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $1.21B   | 71.00%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $1.45B   | 74.99%        |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has demonstrated significant growth in the past, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent financial performance shows a considerable decline in revenue and earnings. While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, the negative PPO and declining relative strength indicate bearish momentum. The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent earnings decline is critical before making any investment decisions.  The high historical volatility and the significant MDD should also be considered.  A thorough due diligence process, encompassing a deeper analysis of the cryptocurrency market and COIN's competitive landscape, is essential.
