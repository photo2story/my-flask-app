## Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) is a publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange.  The cumulative return of COIN (165.41%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (46.46%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 119.0 percentage points.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, is at the 78.4th percentile.  This indicates COIN's performance has been substantially higher than the S&P 500, historically.  However, the high beta values (43.5 - 72.8) in the provided CAGR analysis suggest significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The near-zero alpha suggests that the outperformance is not due to skillful management but may be attributed to the high-risk nature of the cryptocurrency market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $291.0
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $288.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $274.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $283.65

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential uptrend.  The recent price increase (from $281.82 to $291.0) signifies a notable, but not necessarily unsustainable, upward movement.  Further observation is needed to confirm the trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 63.96 (Neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting potential for further upward movement, but not guaranteeing it.)
* **PPO:** 0.75 (Positive value indicates bullish momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.2 (Short-term bearish signal, contradicting the positive price action.  This warrants further investigation and monitoring.)
* **Expected Return:** -2.7% (This suggests a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years).  This contradicts the historical outperformance and highlights the inherent risk in COIN.  This projected return should be viewed cautiously.)
* **Recent Price Change:** The significant price change of $9.18 reflects a strong positive movement. Although positive,  it should be interpreted in light of the relatively high volatility of the asset.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue. While there are periods of high revenue and profit (e.g., Q1 2024), there are also periods of loss (Q3 & Q4 2023). This inconsistency highlights the risk associated with investing in COIN. The large discrepancy in EPS from Q1 2024 to subsequent quarters requires additional investigation to understand the underlying causes.  There appears to be a significant data error with two entries of  2024-10-30.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals fluctuating revenue and profitability. While profit margins are generally high (above 60%), they show a downward trend from Q1 2024. Equity has also experienced growth, but ROE fluctuates significantly, indicating inconsistent profitability and potentially high operational risks.  A deeper dive into the financial statements is needed for a comprehensive understanding.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase's performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically. However, this is accompanied by high volatility and beta values, indicating substantial risk. The recent price increase is positive but should be evaluated cautiously given conflicting short-term indicators (Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence) and the projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500.  The earnings data reveals significant volatility and inconsistency in both EPS and Revenue. The financial information further confirms a pattern of fluctuating profitability. Overall, while Coinbase has demonstrated periods of strong growth, the investment carries significant risk due to its volatility and inconsistent financial performance.  Further due diligence is required before making any investment decisions.  The conflicting signals from the short-term price movement and the long-term expected return warrant a comprehensive risk assessment.  This analysis is based on limited data, and further investigation and updated data is recommended.
