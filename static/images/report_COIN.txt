**1. Company Overview & Performance Comparison:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  Over the period reviewed, COIN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a 51.5% higher cumulative return.  The provided data shows substantial volatility in the relative performance of COIN compared to VOO, ranging from a maximum difference of 168.3% to a minimum of -59.7%.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 45.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 64.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 140.0% | 25.3% | 83.0% | 0.1 | 56.1 |

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across all periods reflects strong growth.  However, the significant alpha values (especially in the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods) suggest periods of substantial outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  Note that the high alpha values and high volatility may reflect the inherent risk of investing in a cryptocurrency-related company.  The beta values are relatively high, indicating higher volatility than the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $215.62
* **Last Market Price:** $221.24 (increase of $2.62)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $215.30
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $258.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $277.74

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend. The recent price increase could be a short-term fluctuation.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 30.14 (suggests the stock is in oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -2.67 (indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.8% (short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -3.4% (relative to the S&P 500)


The low RSI and negative PPO indicate bearish sentiment. The recent price increase, while positive, is not substantial enough to significantly alter this assessment considering the overall market context. The negative expected return relative to VOO suggests a potential underperformance in the long run compared to the broader market.  However, the large variance in the past could indicate high volatility, making it hard to determine long-term relative performance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has demonstrated strong growth and high profitability in certain periods, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 in some periods.

The recent technical indicators suggest bearish sentiment in the short term, and the long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with cryptocurrency-related investments and the significant volatility inherent in COIN's performance before making any investment decisions. Further investigation into the Q2 2024 earnings surge and the causes of the large fluctuations in relative performance compared to the market is warranted.
