2024-12-31 - Analysis Report
## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return of COIN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns between COIN and VOO is 93.6%, which represents the 67.2nd percentile of the historical range of divergence (max 168.3%, min -59.7%).  While this indicates strong outperformance, it's crucial to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) further emphasizes the significant growth, especially from 2022-2024 (165%). However, the negative alpha suggests that the returns were not entirely attributable to superior management compared to the market.  The high Beta (44.0-64.0) signifies higher volatility than the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $255.56
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $268.69 (Price is below the 5-day MA, suggesting a short-term downward trend)
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $298.00 (Price is significantly below the 20-day MA, reinforcing a downward trend)
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $258.44 (Price is slightly below the 60-day MA)


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO (-2.66):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.

**7.  Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase (COIN) shows a history of strong outperformance relative to the S&P 500 but currently exhibits negative momentum.  The stock is trading below key moving averages and shows bearish technical indicators (RSI, PPO). Though the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and downward trend indicate caution. Recent earnings show a dramatic decline in both EPS and revenue after a very strong Q1 2024, highlighting the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market and its impact on Coinbase. The provided expected return (-5.3%) over a long-term horizon suggests that despite previous high growth, future returns may underperform the S&P 500.  Further analysis is required to determine the cause of this performance divergence, whether this underperformance is justified, and the potential risks and rewards associated with future investment in COIN.  Additional information on recent news, analyst opinions, and market outlook is crucial for a more informed decision.
