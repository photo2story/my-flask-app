2025-01-18 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) based on the provided data, presented in a report format.

**Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Investment Report**

**1. Performance Summary and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO)**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.

The cumulative return for COIN is 169.49%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 44.89%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 124.6%, placing it at the 80.8th percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500. This indicates COIN's performance has been substantially higher than the benchmark index over the measured period.  However, the high relative divergence (80.8%) suggests a potential for reversion to the mean, indicating future performance may not necessarily continue at the same pace.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 86.0% | 70.4% | 78.0% | -0.0 | 74.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 137.0% | 67.5% | 115.0% | -0.0 | 74.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 238.0% | 43.5% | 169.0% | -0.0 | 74.0 |

The consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) across the periods suggests strong growth, although the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures warn of significant potential for price drops. The Alpha values are not consistent with a Beta of 74.  An investigation into the calculation methodology for Alpha and Beta is needed to ensure these values are accurately reported. A beta of 74 suggests extremely high volatility compared to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $295.48
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $271.72
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $269.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $274.26

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  However, this needs to be considered in conjunction with other indicators.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.19  (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.97 (Positive; suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +11.9% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -2.9% (vs. S&P 500)

The current price ($295.48) is significantly above the recent moving averages. This could signal a potential short-term pullback, although the positive PPO suggests continuing upward momentum.  The negative expected return highlights the inherent risks associated with COIN and the need to consider the high volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30 | $1.21B       |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15 | $1.45B       |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84 | $1.64B       |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01| $0.67B       |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01| $0.67B       |

There's significant volatility in EPS, with a very high value in Q2 2024 ($4.84).  This needs further investigation to understand the underlying drivers. Revenue is relatively stable, though there is a downward trend recently. The inconsistency between the October 30th entries requires clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99%      |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16%      |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13%      |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.67B | 61.01%      |

Profit margins are generally high but show a declining trend.  Revenue also shows a decline in the most recent quarters.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B | 0.86% |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B | 0.43% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B | 4.35% |
| 2023-09-30 | $5.92B | -0.04% |

Equity is increasing, but ROE is highly volatile.  The significant drop in ROE in the last two quarters is a concern.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has demonstrated significant growth, substantially outperforming the S&P 500. However, this performance is accompanied by considerable volatility, reflected in the high beta, maximum drawdown, and fluctuations in earnings and financial metrics.  The extremely high beta value needs further investigation into the data source and calculation methodology. The data suggests a potential short-term pullback, but longer-term prospects are uncertain, particularly given the negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 and the recent declines in revenue and ROE.  Further due diligence is required, focusing on the causes of the volatile earnings and the extremely high beta value before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistencies in the reported data also need clarification.
