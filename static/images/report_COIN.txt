Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.

The cumulative return of COIN is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative return between COIN and VOO is 120.6 percentage points, placing COIN at the 79.1 percentile of its historical relative performance against VOO (based on provided min/max range).  This indicates strong outperformance compared to the broader market.

| Year       | COIN CAGR | VOO CAGR (Implied) | Alpha | Beta |
|------------|------------|--------------------|-------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 86.0%      | N/A                | -0.0  | 74.0  |
| 2022-2024  | 137.0%     | N/A                | -0.0  | 74.0  |
| 2023-2025  | 239.0%     | N/A                | -0.0  | 74.0  |


**Note:**  VOO CAGR is not directly provided and can't be calculated without additional data. The Alpha of -0.0 suggests that COIN's returns aren't significantly different from what would be expected given its beta (74.0, indicating high market sensitivity).  This high beta explains a substantial portion of COIN’s performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $296.01
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $292.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $271.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $278.71

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day MA indicates limited recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 69.33 – Approaching overbought territory (generally considered above 70). This suggests potential for a short-term correction.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 1.60 – Positive value indicates upward momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +5.7 – Shows a recent increase in relative strength.

* **Expected Return:** -2.9% –  This indicates a negative expected return relative to the market over the long term (2+ years).  This is contradictory to the strong historical performance and needs further investigation to determine the reliability of this forecast. The discrepancy may arise from differing forecasting methodologies or underlying assumptions.

The small price change of $0.054 does not indicate a significant rapid increase or decrease.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COIN exhibits substantial volatility, both in terms of price and financial metrics.  While historical performance against VOO has been remarkably strong, the projected long-term expected return is negative.  Significant inconsistencies and outliers in the earnings and financial data raise concerns about data quality and require further investigation. The high beta suggests that a large portion of COIN’s risk and return is directly tied to overall market movements. Investors should carefully consider the inherent risks associated with investing in COIN, given its high volatility and sensitivity to market conditions.   Before making any investment decisions, further due diligence, including examining the sources of the reported earnings data, is strongly recommended.  The high beta alone warrants caution.
