## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Summary:**

Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The following analysis uses provided data to assess its performance.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 51.98%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 12.13%
* **Return Difference:** 39.85%  (COIN outperformed VOO significantly)
* **Relative Deviation:** 52.2% (indicates COIN's performance is in the upper 52nd percentile of its historical range relative to VOO).

The provided data shows COIN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  However, the relative deviation highlights that such outperformance isn't consistently maintained.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 45.0% | -0.0 | 44.2 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 114.0% | -0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 90.0% | 74.8% | 79.0% | -0.0 | 48.2 |

The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) suggests strong growth, but the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates significant risk.  Alpha values are unusually high and inconsistent, potentially indicating data errors or non-standard calculation methods. Beta near zero suggests low correlation with the market, which is unusual for a large-cap company.  Market cap fluctuated considerably during these periods.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $190.0
* **5-day Moving Average:** $177.56
* **20-day Moving Average:** $175.85
* **60-day Moving Average:** $216.17

The closing price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average, implying a potential longer-term downward trend reversal.  The significant price increase from the previous close ($175 to $190) indicates a sharp upward move, possibly driven by short-term market factors.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.57 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 1.94 (Positive value indicates bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +6.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -5.1% (Below S&P 500 expectation)


The indicators suggest a relatively neutral-to-bullish outlook.  The positive PPO and RSI above 50 support the upward price movement. However, the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises concerns about long-term potential. The significant price change from the previous close warrants further investigation into the driving factors of this recent surge.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30 | $1.21B        |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15 | $1.45B        |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84 | $1.64B        |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01| $0.67B        |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01| $0.67B        |

Earnings are highly volatile.  The extremely high EPS in Q2 2024 is an outlier and needs further investigation.  Otherwise, revenue shows some fluctuations, but the negative EPS in two quarters points to inconsistent profitability.

Equity has increased substantially. ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates significantly, mirroring the volatile earnings.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a high CAGR. However, this is accompanied by high risk, as evidenced by substantial MDD and volatile earnings.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture; while short-term momentum is positive, the long-term outlook is less certain given the negative expected return relative to the market.  The recent sharp price increase necessitates investigation into the underlying factors.   The high profit margins are a positive sign, but the inconsistent earnings and volatile ROE indicate a high-risk, high-reward investment.  Further investigation into the unusually high Q2 2024 EPS and inconsistencies in the Alpha and Beta values is crucial before drawing definitive conclusions.  A long-term investment decision should be based on a deeper dive into the causes of earnings volatility and the sustainability of the company's high profit margins.
