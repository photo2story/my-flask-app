**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  Its cumulative return (147.66%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (44.19%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 103.5 percentage points, placing it at the 71.5th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 (based on a range of -59.7% to 168.4%).  While the alpha is reported as near zero, the significantly higher beta (45.0 - 70.0) indicates a much higher volatility than the market benchmark.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is also significantly higher than the S&P 500 over the given periods, further highlighting the substantial outperformance.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 45.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $268.15
* **Last Market Price:** $279.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $282.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $304.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $251.69

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it's above its 60-day moving average, indicating potential longer-term support.  The significant difference between the last market price and the closing price ($279.62 vs $268.15) requires further investigation for potential reasons behind this discrepancy. This could be due to after-hours trading or other market events.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 38.04 (Approaching oversold territory, potentially signaling a bounce)
* **PPO:** -2.98 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence:** -17.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 55.1% (Significant outperformance of the S&P 500 expected)

The RSI suggests the stock may be oversold, potentially leading to a price rebound. However, the negative PPO and negative relative strength divergence indicate bearish momentum in the short-term.  The high expected return is contingent upon the long-term growth of the cryptocurrency market and COIN's ability to maintain its market share.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility. Revenue fluctuated considerably across the quarters, peaking at $1.64B in Q1 2024 and falling to $1.21B in Q3 2024. EPS followed a similar erratic pattern, with a high of $4.84 in Q1 2024 followed by significant drops. Notably, there is a repeated entry for 2024-10-30, indicating a possible data error or reporting inconsistency requiring clarification.  Without further context, it is impossible to definitively assess whether the results were "beats" or "misses" against analyst expectations.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue declined from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024.  Profit margins were consistently high, above 70%, except for Q3 2023 which showed a lower margin of 61.01%. This fluctuation necessitates further analysis to understand the underlying drivers.
* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity increased steadily over the period, reflecting the companyâ€™s overall financial health. The Return on Equity (ROE) shows considerable fluctuation, reaching a high of 14.57% in Q1 2024, but also exhibiting periods of low or negative ROE.  This high variability is a cause for concern.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**  No recent news (within the last 2 days) was provided.  Information on market outlook and analyst opinions is needed for a more complete analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

COIN has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term. However, the recent price action, technical indicators, and erratic earnings results paint a mixed picture. The substantial volatility in both price and fundamentals indicates a high-risk, high-reward investment. The long-term projected return is encouraging, but investors need to be prepared for significant price swings.  More information on recent news, analyst sentiment, and a clarification on the duplicated earnings data point are crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.
