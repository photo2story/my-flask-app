## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Investment Review

**1. Performance Overview & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The cumulative return for COIN from the start date to the end date of the provided data is 179.25%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 47.03%.  The difference in returns is 132.2%, placing it at the 84.1st percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided minimum and maximum divergence data.  While the high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in the provided analysis indicates strong past performance, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. The Alpha values close to zero suggest COIN's returns are largely in line with market movements, indicating significant exposure to market risk (high Beta).

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 45.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 209.0% | 34.8% | 170.0% | -0.0 | 78.0 |

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.6% – Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 43.2% – This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.  This is a significant figure, but the reliability depends heavily on the model used for the projection.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions which was not provided in the original prompt.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase (COIN) shows significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the provided period, with a substantially higher cumulative return.  However, the high volatility in both price and earnings suggests significant risk.  Technical indicators are mixed, and the relatively low RSI coupled with a negative PPO hints at potential further short-term downward pressure. The high expected return (43.2%) is promising for long-term investors, but requires verification of the underlying model and assumptions.  Further investigation is needed into recent news, market sentiment, and analyst predictions to form a more complete picture.  The inconsistent financial performance highlights the inherent risks associated with investing in COIN.  A thorough due diligence process considering all factors is crucial before making any investment decisions.
