The 50.5% difference highlights COIN's outperformance, though the high relative divergence (57.6%) suggests this outperformance is relatively high compared to its historical range.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 45.0% | -0.0 | 42.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 114.0% | -0.0 | 61.3 |
| 2023-2025  | 106.0% | 74.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 51.8 |

The high CAGR values indicate strong growth, while the consistently high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) suggests significant volatility.  The alpha values, though listed as -0.0, seem to be incorrect and should be re-examined.  Beta values suggest high sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $209.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $194.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $176.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $212.13

The price is above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term uptrend, but below the 60-day moving average, suggesting potential resistance at higher levels. The recent price change of $2.83 indicates a modest positive move, not a dramatic surge.

**3. Technical Indicators and Divergence:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk) suggests a moderate level of risk.
* **RSI (76.97):**  Indicates overbought conditions, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (3.32):** Shows positive momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +11.2%, signifying a short-term upward trend.

The combination of overbought RSI and positive PPO suggests a potential short-term pullback might occur despite the positive relative divergence.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30  | $1.21B      |

| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01 | $0.67B      |

There is significant variability in EPS, with a surprisingly high EPS in May 2024 ($4.84). This needs further investigation to understand the drivers. Revenue figures show some fluctuation but overall positive trend.  The repeated entry for October 30th, 2024 should be verified for accuracy.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase (COIN) has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO),  demonstrated by high cumulative returns and positive PPO. However, high volatility (indicated by MDD and RSI), along with a negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500, raises concerns. The inconsistent earnings data requires further investigation. While the company exhibits strong profitability and increasing equity, the high relative divergence and overbought RSI suggest a potential correction might be imminent.  A long-term investment strategy should carefully consider the high volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market and the company's dependence on cryptocurrency market conditions.  Further due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The provided alpha values need further clarification.
