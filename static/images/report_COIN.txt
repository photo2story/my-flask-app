**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The provided data shows COIN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While the cumulative return of COIN is considerably higher, the relative divergence suggests this outperformance is within the range of historical variability.

The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta analysis reveals substantial volatility and varying performance across different periods:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 45.0% | -0.0 | 44.3 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 114.0% | -0.0 | 63.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 103.0% | 74.8% | 86.0% | -0.0 | 52.5 |


High CAGR is offset by significant Maximum Drawdown (MDD), indicating substantial risk.  Alpha consistently near zero suggests the returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta).  Capitalization (Cap) fluctuates.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $206.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $203.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $180.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $209.11

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent short-term upward momentum.  However, it's below the 60-day average, indicating a potential short-term overbought condition.  The significant difference between the 20-day and 60-day averages suggests recent volatility.  The small daily price change of $0.42 doesn't indicate a significant surge or drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.379 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 81.36 (Overbought)
* **PPO:** 3.10 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** +3.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -3.9% (Negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term â€“ needs further elaboration on the calculation methodology)


The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, potentially indicating a correction is due.  The positive PPO confirms the short-term upward momentum.  The negative expected return needs further clarification.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30    | $1.21B        |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15    | $1.45B        |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84    | $1.64B        |

| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01   | $0.67B        |

There's significant volatility in EPS and revenue. The extremely high EPS in Q2 2024 is an outlier and requires further investigation to understand the underlying factors.  The negative EPS in other quarters highlights the inconsistency in profitability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase (COIN) has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 historically, but this is accompanied by high volatility and risk.  Recent price action suggests short-term upward momentum, but indicators like RSI point to potential overbought conditions.  Earnings are highly volatile, and while profit margins are generally high, revenue and profitability lack consistency. The long-term outlook is uncertain, and the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises concerns.  Further investigation into the outlier EPS figure in Q2 2024 and clarification on the expected return calculation are crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  Investors should carefully weigh the high potential returns against the inherent risk associated with this volatile stock.
