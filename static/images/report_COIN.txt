2025-03-24 - Analysis Report
## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  This report analyzes COIN's performance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), considering its recent price movements, financial statements, and key market indicators.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

COIN's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500.

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 71.14%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 31.50%
* **Return Difference:** 39.6%
* **Relative Divergence:** 43.8% (This indicates COIN's outperformance relative to its historical performance range against VOO.)

The provided CAGR data shows highly volatile growth for COIN, significantly exceeding the VOO's returns in the periods analyzed. However, the high Beta values (44.1-63.0) indicate that COIN's price is highly sensitive to market fluctuations.  The Alpha values, while mostly near zero, suggest limited outperformance relative to the market risk after adjusting for beta.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 90.0% | 33.7% | 84.0% | 0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 158.0% | 33.7% | 125.0% | 0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 115.0% | 26.0% | 70.0% | 0.1 | 48.2 |


**2) Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $189.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $188.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $200.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $249.72

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price change (-$0.27) reflects a slight decrease compared to the previous closing price.


**3) Market Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.50 (Slightly below neutral; suggests potential for further downside)
* **PPO:** 0.29 (Positive, but relatively low; indicates weak momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.0 (Short-term upward trend, but needs confirmation)
* **Expected Return:** 0.1% (This low figure suggests that the market does not anticipate significant returns in the near term relative to the S&P 500.  A long-term investment strategy is implied, relying on a significant growth opportunity over 2+ years.)

The negative price change and relatively low RSI and PPO values suggest a cautious outlook in the short term.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  While there are periods of high EPS and revenue, there are also periods of losses.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes of this volatility.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.3   | $1.21B        |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15  | $1.45B        |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84  | $1.64B        |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01 | $0.67B        |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01 | $0.67B        |  *(Duplicate entry - likely a data error)*


**5) Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability tables show significant quarter-to-quarter fluctuations.  While revenue is generally strong and profit margins are high, the ROE fluctuates considerably, indicating inconsistent profitability and potentially vulnerability to market conditions.  Further investigation into the causes of this volatility is recommended.


| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.27B    | 75.56%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B    | 71.00%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B    | 74.99%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B    | 76.16%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B    | 71.13%        |

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE    |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.28B    | 12.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B     | 0.86%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B     | 0.43%  |

| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B     | 4.35%  |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

COIN exhibits significant growth potential but also considerable volatility. Its high historical returns compared to the S&P 500 are noteworthy, but this performance is associated with a high beta, indicating substantial market risk.  Recent price movements suggest a bearish trend, supported by relatively low RSI and PPO values.  The inconsistent earnings data and fluctuations in ROE require further investigation to understand the underlying drivers of this volatility.  While a long-term investment strategy might be considered, given the potential for significant growth, a cautious approach is warranted due to the inherent risks associated with the cryptocurrency market and COIN's high sensitivity to market fluctuations.  A deeper dive into the specific reasons behind the revenue and profitability swings is crucial before making any investment decisions.
