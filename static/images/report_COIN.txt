## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:** Coinbase Global, Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  This report analyzes its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering recent price movements, financial indicators, and earnings data to assess its current status and long-term investment potential.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Coinbase's cumulative return (138.27%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (49.00%). The difference (89.3%) places it at the 65.4th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 (max difference: 168.3%, min difference: -59.7%).  While this shows strong relative performance, it's crucial to remember this is relative to historical volatility.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 184.0% | 24.9% | 121.0% | 0.1 | 67.2 |

**Analysis:**  Coinbase demonstrates high Compound Annual Growth Rates (CAGR) significantly exceeding the S&P 500, indicating strong growth.  However, high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight substantial risk.  The positive Alpha values (particularly in the later periods) suggest outperformance relative to the market.  A beta near 0 implies low correlation with the overall market.  The increasing market capitalization reflects growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $264.63
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $275.77
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $283.57
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $288.24

**Analysis:** The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The significant gap between the closing price and the short-term moving averages highlights a recent price decline.  The large negative change from the previous close (-3.53%) indicates a substantial drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.78 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.47 (Negative value indicating bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -7.1% (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** -2.7% (This is a short-term outlook. Long-term expected returns are likely higher due to the companyâ€™s growth potential, and should outperform S&P 500).


**Analysis:** Both RSI and PPO indicate bearish sentiment. The negative relative divergence confirms a short-term downtrend. The -2.7% expected return suggests negative short-term performance. However, the substantial long-term growth shown in the CAGR should be considered.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.3   | $1.21B        |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15  | $1.45B        |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84  | $1.64B        |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01 | $0.67B        |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01 | $0.67B        |


**Analysis:** Earnings are volatile.  There's a significant jump in EPS in Q2 2024 ($4.84), followed by a drop in subsequent quarters. Revenue also shows some volatility but generally remains in the $1B+ range except for 2023-11-02 and 2024-10-30. This requires further investigation for the reasons for the volatility.

**5. Financial Information:**

| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B  | 14.57% |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B  | 4.35%  |

**Analysis:** Revenue fluctuates, while profit margins remain consistently high (above 70%).  Equity shows growth, but ROE is highly volatile, suggesting potential instability in profitability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase exhibits substantial growth potential, reflected in its high CAGR and outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, significant risks are present, evidenced by high MDD and volatile earnings and ROE.  The recent price decline and bearish technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend.  A long-term investment approach, considering the company's growth potential and its position in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market, might be considered alongside diversification and risk management strategies.  Further investigation into the reasons behind earnings volatility is crucial before making any investment decisions.
