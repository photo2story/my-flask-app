**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Coinbase Global, Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The following analysis summarizes its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) using provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 165.71%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 46.43%
* **Return Difference:** 119.3%
* **Relative Divergence:** 78.5% (This indicates COIN's performance significantly outpaces VOO, positioned at the 78.5th percentile of its historical relative performance range.)

The table below shows CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta, and Market Cap.  Note that Alpha and Beta are highly variable and depend on the specific time period considered.  A positive alpha indicates outperformance relative to the benchmark (market), while Beta measures volatility relative to the benchmark (market).


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 96.0% | 34.8% | 90.0% | -0.0 | 43.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 159.0% | 34.8% | 126.0% | 0.0 | 62.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 211.0% | 24.9% | 151.0% | 0.1 | 72.9 |


**Analysis:**  COIN significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the periods analyzed, showcasing substantial growth. However, the high volatility (reflected in the MDD and Beta values), especially before 2023-2025, warrants careful consideration.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $291.33
* **Previous Close:** $301.30
* **Change:** -$3.30 (Price dropped significantly in the last day.)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $288.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $279.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $287.50

**Analysis:** The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages but above the 20-day moving average, suggesting recent price weakening; this is confirmed by the significant one day drop.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 64.76 (Slightly above neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** 0.76 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term, 2+ years):** -2.6% (Relative to S&P 500. This implies that whilst COIN has outperformed historically, future returns may be lower compared to the broader market.)

**Analysis:** While the technical indicators suggest a slightly bullish trend, the significant recent price drop and negative expected return warrant caution.  The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 suggests a potential risk of underperformance in the long term.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30  | $1.21B         |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15  | $1.45B         |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84  | $1.64B         |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01 | $0.67B         |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01 | $0.67B         |

**Analysis:**  Earnings show significant volatility. Note the outlier of $4.84 EPS in Q2 2024; understanding the factors behind this is crucial.  Revenue has generally been declining recently though Q2 2024 was particularly high.  This inconsistency necessitates further investigation into the underlying drivers of revenue and profitability.

| 2023-09-30 | $5.92B | -0.04% |

**Analysis:** Profit margins are generally high, but revenue shows volatility.  ROE (Return on Equity) also shows significant fluctuation, indicating potential instability in profitability and the efficiency of capital usage.  More investigation into the causes of these fluctuations is needed.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase has shown remarkable historical growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this performance is accompanied by considerable volatility.  Recent price movements suggest a weakening trend, supported by a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 and inconsistent earnings.  The financial data also reveals volatility in revenue, profitability, and ROE.  Further investigation is needed to assess the sustainability of COIN's growth and understand the underlying factors driving the volatility observed across all metrics.  A deeper dive into the causes of the fluctuating revenue and earnings, especially the exceptional Q2 2024 numbers, and  a more thorough risk assessment are crucial before making any investment decisions.
