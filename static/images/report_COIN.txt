| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta  | Market Cap (B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 2021-2023  | -19.1%  | 76.7%   | -29.6%| 5.2   | 35.6           |
| 2022-2024  | 7.4%    | 70.5%   | -2.0% | 5.5   | 60.1           |

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant volatility.  A negative CAGR in 2021-2023 highlights the risks associated with the cryptocurrency market. The high maximum drawdown (MDD) further underscores this volatility.  The high beta (significantly above 1) indicates COIN is substantially more volatile than the overall market.  The alpha values need more context (what benchmark is used?) to interpret meaningfully.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $310.98 (Last Market: $310.84)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $303.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $276.11
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $212.16

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The significant difference between the short-term and long-term moving averages indicates potential momentum.

The closing price near the last market price ($310.84) doesn't indicate any extreme price swings (no significant rapid increase or decrease).
