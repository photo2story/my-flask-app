## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The following analysis utilizes provided data to assess its performance.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **COIN Cumulative Return:** 41.79%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 11.67%
* **Return Difference:** 30.1%
* **Relative Divergence:** 46.6% (This indicates COIN's outperformance relative to its historical range against VOO;  it is not a measure of absolute superiority.)


The table below shows a high CAGR for COIN across different periods, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, the high maximum drawdown (MDD) highlights significant risk.  The beta values suggest high sensitivity to market movements.  Alpha near zero indicates the returns are mostly explained by market movements.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 62.0% | 73.9% | 47.0% | -0.0 | 44.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 136.0% | 73.9% | 116.0% | 0.0 | 63.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 80.0% | 74.8% | 69.0% | -0.0 | 45.0 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $177.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $163.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $180.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $230.87

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price jump from the previous close ($151.47 to $177.09, a $16.91 increase) indicates a significant, sudden upward movement which may be influenced by short-term market events and should be considered when assessing the provided data.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.21 (Slightly below neutral; not oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.1653 (Negative; bearish signal)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.4% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -6.3% (Expected to underperform S&P 500 over the long term)


The high MRI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence change all suggest a bearish outlook.  The significant recent price increase might be temporary, and the negative expected return reinforces the potential risk.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $0.30   | $1.21B        |
| 2024-08-01 | $0.15   | $1.45B        |
| 2024-05-02 | $4.84   | $1.64B        |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.01  | $0.67B        |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.01  | $0.67B        |

There is significant volatility in EPS.  The extremely high EPS in Q2 2024 warrants further investigation. The large swings in revenue also need explanation.   The negative EPS in two quarters reflects fluctuating profitability.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.27B | 75.56%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.21B | 71.00%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.45B | 74.99%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.64B | 76.16%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.95B | 71.13%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE      |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.28B  | 12.56%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $8.73B   | 0.86%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $8.37B   | 0.43%    |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B   | 14.57%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.28B   | 4.35%    |

Profit margins are consistently high, indicating strong profitability.  However, ROE is volatile.  The significant increase in equity and ROE in Q4 2024 needs further scrutiny.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Coinbase exhibits high growth potential (as shown by its CAGR), but also carries substantial risk (high MDD and beta).  The recent price surge might be a temporary phenomenon, not necessarily indicative of sustainable long-term growth.  The conflicting signals from technical indicators and the volatile earnings data suggest caution.  While the company demonstrates strong profitability, the erratic nature of its financial performance requires a thorough investigation of underlying factors before making any investment decisions.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  Further due diligence, including an analysis of the reasons behind the dramatic EPS and revenue fluctuations, is crucial before any investment strategy is formulated.
