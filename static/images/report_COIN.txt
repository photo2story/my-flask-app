## Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) Investment Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Coinbase Global Inc. is a leading cryptocurrency exchange platform.  The provided data shows a significant outperformance of COIN compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for COIN is 141.12%, while VOO's is 29.13%. This results in a raw difference of 112.0 percentage points.  The relative outperformance, considering the historical range of the difference between the two, places COIN at the 71st percentile.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided CAGR figures for COIN substantially exceed those implied by the beta.  This suggests significant alpha generation, especially considering the Beta (market risk sensitivity) which is considerably high.  However, the analysis period is short, limiting the reliability of these figures.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $264.33
* **Last Market Price:** $260.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $265.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $284.07
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $266.59

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term trend that might be slightly more positive. The difference between the closing price and the last market price reflects minor intraday volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 34.31 – This indicates that the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.93 – This negative value confirms bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +2.4 – Shows short-term upward movement, contradicting the RSI and PPO. This divergence should be treated with caution.
* **Expected Return:** -5.4% – This projects a negative return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  The discrepancy between this figure and the historical CAGR should be examined in the context of market conditions and inherent risk.

The Last-market price of $260.36 is lower than the closing price, which doesn't show significant negative news.  A larger gap would warrant further investigation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates considerably, with a peak of $1.64B in Q1 2024.  Revenue decreased significantly in Q4 2023 and then started to recover. The most recent quarter indicates a continued decrease.
* **EPS:** EPS is highly volatile, ranging from a high of $4.84 to a low of -$0.01.  There is no clear trend.  The significant drop in EPS from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024 is notable and demands further analysis beyond the data provided.  The reported Q4 2024 EPS is similar to Q3 2024.

The provided data does not give sufficient context to assess whether these numbers beat or missed expectations.
