## Intel Corporation (INTC) Stock Analysis Report

**Company Overview:** Intel Corporation is a leading global semiconductor manufacturer, developing and producing processors, chipsets, and other computing components.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **INTC's cumulative return:** -45.57%
* **S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return:** 81.34%
* **Divergence:** -126.91 (Relative Divergence: 3.69)

**INTC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, lagging behind by over 126%**. While the relative divergence of 3.69 suggests INTC is positioned slightly better than its historical worst performance, it still indicates significant underperformance compared to the broader market.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $18.89
* **5-day Moving Average:** $19.97
* **20-day Moving Average:** $20.27
* **60-day Moving Average:** $27.06

**INTC's current price is below all three moving averages**, suggesting potential downward pressure and a short-term bearish sentiment. The 60-day moving average, however, indicates a considerable price decline over the past two months.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 39.96
* **PPO:** 0.82
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -3.64
* **Expected_Return:** 18.9% (5-year maximum)

**INTC's RSI is below 50**, indicating a potential oversold condition and possible short-term price rebound. However, the negative delta relative divergence indicates a recent downtrend in the short term. The positive PPO value suggests a potential bullish momentum in the long term, but it's important to consider the recent negative divergence. The expected return of 18.9% highlights the potential for growth, but it's crucial to consider the current market conditions and overall performance.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date | EPS | Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-08-02 | -0.38 | $12.83 B |
| 2024-04-26 | -0.09 | $12.72 B |
| 2023-10-27 | 0.07 | $14.16 B |
| 2023-07-28 | 0.35 | $12.95 B |
| 2024-08-02 | 0.35 | $12.95 B |

The most recent earnings report for Q2 2024 (released on August 2nd) showed an EPS of -0.38, significantly below analysts' expectations. Revenue of $12.83 billion also fell short of estimates. The company attributed the underperformance to a challenging macroeconomic environment and declining demand for personal computers. The outlook remains uncertain, and Intel expects continued pressure in the near term. 

**5. Summary:**

INTC has significantly underperformed the market in recent years, experiencing declining earnings and revenue. While current technical indicators suggest potential for short-term rebound, the recent price drop and negative divergence signal continued downward pressure. The company faces challenges in the current macroeconomic environment, leading to uncertainty about future performance.  Investors should closely monitor the company's strategy and execution moving forward, as well as the overall market sentiment.

**6. Conclusion:**

While INTC presents an attractive potential for long-term growth, the current market conditions and recent performance indicate a cautious approach may be warranted. Considering the downward trend, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, and the challenges faced by the company, investors should proceed with caution and carefully assess their investment strategy before making any decisions.
