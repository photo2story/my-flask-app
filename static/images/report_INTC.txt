Investors should carefully consider the current market conditions and the company's future growth prospects before making any investment decisions. It's crucial to monitor the company's future performance and assess the impact of its strategic initiatives on its overall business.  While a long-term investment may be worthwhile given INTC's position in the semiconductor industry, short-term trading should be approached with caution due to the company's current struggles.
