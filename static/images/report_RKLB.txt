**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출        |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.13 | 0.14 B$    |

| 2024-08-08 | -0.08 | 0.11 B$    |
| 2025-08-07 | -0.08 | 0.11 B$    |

**Analysis:** EPS is consistently negative, suggesting the company is not yet profitable. However, revenue is showing growth. The significant growth in revenue from 0.10B in 2024-11-12 to 0.14B in 2025-08-07 is promising, as the company might have stronger profit later on.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------- |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.14B   | 32.10%          |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.12B   | 28.76%          |

**Analysis:** Revenue is growing, and profit margins are improving. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is negative, which means the company is losing money as a ratio of equity investments. The increase in equity between 2024-12-31 and 2025-06-30 suggest the company might be trying to raise equity by issuing stocks.

**7. Overall Analysis and Conclusion**

Rocket Lab (RKLB) exhibits significant growth potential, as reflected in its outperformance compared to the S&P 500 and positive analyst ratings. Recent news and contract wins (e.g., JAXA, NASA) support this outlook. The current high stock price indicates strong market momentum. However, the RSI indicates that the stock is overbought, which could be the signal of price retracements. While revenue growth and improving profit margins are encouraging, the company's current lack of profitability (negative EPS and ROE) is a point of concern. The analysis shows a bullish outlook, but it's recommended that investors proceed with caution, as short-term corrections could occur.
