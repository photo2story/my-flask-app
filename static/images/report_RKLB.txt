**6) Overall Analysis:**

RKLB shows significant potential, evidenced by its strong recent performance relative to the S&P 500. However, several red flags exist.  Consistently negative EPS and ROE raise serious concerns about long-term sustainability.  High volatility and a fluctuating beta indicate significant risk. The recent price increase is puzzling given the negative long-term expected return.  More in-depth analysis is required to determine if the company's recent performance is sustainable and whether the risks outweigh the potential rewards.  Clarification on the meaning of the "-23.3% expected return" and the duplicate entry in the earnings data are crucial for a complete assessment.  Investors should carefully consider all available information before making any investment decisions.
