**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Rocket Lab (RKLB) is a high-growth company in the space industry with significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this comes with considerable risk, as reflected in the high maximum drawdown. The provided Beta is highly suspect and needs further verification.

The company's revenue is growing, and its profit margin is improving, suggesting that it is on a path towards profitability. Analyst sentiment is generally positive. However, the recent news headlines highlight the volatile nature of the stock and the uncertainty surrounding its future performance. The news indicates caution for 2026, while others express optimism about the breakout year.

The recent decline in relative divergence suggests a short-term underperformance. While the MRI suggests a buy opportunity, investors should consider all the data points and their own risk tolerance. It's a speculative investment with high potential, but also high risk.  Investors need to do their own research and consider the negative EPS and ROE, as well as the mixed analyst opinions and recent news.

**In summary: RKLB presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. While there are positive signs of revenue growth and improving profitability, the company is not yet profitable, and its stock price is subject to volatility and varying analyst opinions.**
