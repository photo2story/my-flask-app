**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| 2020-2022  | -39.0%  | 70.8%  | -0.37 | 1.8   | 1       |
| 2021-2023  | 0.0%    | 71.5%  | -0.19 | 2.6   | 1       |
| 2022-2024  | 189.0% | 74.7%  | 1.69 | 12.0  | 1       |

The table shows high volatility (MDD) and significant beta, indicating high sensitivity to market movements.  The positive CAGRs in recent years are notable, but the negative alphas suggest underperformance relative to the market risk.  The large swings in beta suggest substantial changes in the companyâ€™s market sensitivity over time. Note that Cap(B) might be incorrect, possibly indicating market capitalization that is not directly comparable between rows.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $19.04
* **Previous Close:** $18.65
* **Daily Change:** +2.09%
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $19.70
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $18.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $21.88

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend despite the recent positive daily change.  The price is above the 20-day moving average, suggesting some short-term support.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 52.91 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.04 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -7.4% (This suggests that even with long-term investment (2+ years), the expected return is likely to underperform S&P 500, relative to the current analysis.)

The recent price change of +2.09% suggests a small upward bounce but is not significant enough to be considered a rapid surge.  The negative expected return is concerning, especially considering the previously high returns, potentially signaling a reversion to the mean.

| 2024-11-12 | -0.08 | $0.07 B       | *(Duplicate entry - likely a data error)*

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.13B    | 27.81%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.10B    | 26.71%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.11B    | 25.56%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE          |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B   | -13.69%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.42B   | -12.37%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B   | -9.15%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B   | -9.24%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B   | -9.11%        |

Revenue shows moderate growth, and profit margins are relatively stable and healthy. However, the negative ROE consistently points to a lack of profitability on the invested capital. This is a major concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown exceptional past performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, several red flags exist: consistently negative EPS, negative ROE, high volatility, and a projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500. While the company exhibits healthy revenue and profit margins, the lack of profitability on invested capital and negative earnings raise serious questions about its long-term sustainability.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative EPS and ROE, along with a thorough review of the company's future growth prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The recent price movement should be viewed cautiously within the context of these fundamental weaknesses.  The high past performance should not be taken as a guarantee of future returns.
