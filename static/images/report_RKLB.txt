**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) is a space launch and satellite manufacturing company.  Over the periods shown, RKLB significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 154.33% compared to VOO's 49.06%. The difference of 105.3% places it in the upper 55.3% percentile of historical return differentials compared to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  However, the alpha consistently remains near zero, suggesting that the outperformance might be primarily due to high beta (market sensitivity).  The significantly increasing beta over the years indicates increasing market sensitivity. High volatility is also evident in the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures.  The extremely high return in 2022-2024 is noteworthy but potentially unsustainable.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of $18.94 is slightly below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term downward trend.  However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a more substantial decline from recent highs. The recent price increase of 2.21% (from $18.53) shows a minor positive short-term change.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (51.21):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in a neutral territory.
* **PPO (0.97):** A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum.
* **Relative Strength:**  The recent increase in relative strength (0.2) suggests short-term upward momentum.
* **MRI (0.42):** Indicates a medium level of market risk.
* **Expected Return (-29.3%):**  This indicates a significant negative expected return relative to the investment horizon (2 years or more).  This contrasts sharply with the past performance and suggests caution. The high Beta reflects this risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently reported negative EPS, although revenue has shown a slight upward trend.  The recent earnings suggest that profitability isn't yet a strong feature of the business, despite increasing revenue.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-12 | -0.1 | 0.10 B$ |
| 2024-08-08 | -0.08 | 0.11 B$ |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has been steadily increasing, showcasing growth in the company's top line.  However, profit margins, while positive, aren't exceptionally high, and the negative ROE is a major concern, suggesting the company isn't effectively generating returns on its equity.  The decreasing Equity figure over time further supports this concern.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown remarkable past performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this performance is characterized by high volatility and a high beta, indicating significant market sensitivity. The consistently negative EPS and ROE raise serious concerns about the company's long-term profitability and sustainability. While revenue is growing, the negative ROE and projected negative expected return suggest caution.  The high past returns may not be indicative of future performance, and investors should proceed with caution, considering the inherent risks associated with this stock.  Further investigation into the company's future growth prospects and profitability is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current price action indicates potential short-term downward pressure.
