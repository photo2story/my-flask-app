## Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) Stock Analysis Report

**0) Executive Summary:** Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB), a provider of launch services and space systems, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. However, recent financial data reveals consistent losses despite growing revenue.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of its growth and profitability.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Rocket Lab's cumulative return (358.22%) drastically exceeds the S&P 500's (63.99%).  The divergence is substantial (294.2 percentage points), placing it at the 91st percentile of its historical range (max 331.1%, min -79.2%). This highlights significant outperformance relative to the broader market, though the sustainability of this difference is questionable.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -52.0%  | 30.6% | -47.0% | 0.0 | 1.7   |
| 2021-2023  | -18.0%  | 30.6% | -42.0% | 0.0 | 2.5   |
| 2022-2024  | 328.0%  | 30.6% | 295.0% | -0.0 | 11.4  |
| 2023-2025  | 393.0%  | 28.5% | 332.0% | 0.0 | 13.0  |

The high Beta values (especially in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025) indicate high sensitivity to market movements. The dramatic shift from negative CAGR to extremely positive CAGR needs further investigation to understand the drivers behind this change and the likelihood of its continuation.  The negative Alpha values initially suggest underperformance relative to the market, but this dramatically changes, which needs further investigation.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $29.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $28.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $27.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $23.80

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, the relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages implies relatively limited momentum.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (55.56):** Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (-0.32):** Suggests bearish momentum, although it's relatively close to zero.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-4.5):** Shows a recent slight weakening of upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (-11.2%):**  A negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) implies underperformance.  However, this should be considered in light of the already significant outperformance observed.  The relatively small change in closing price (1.82$) compared to the previous close, doesn't suggest significant recent volatility, either positive or negative.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.10  | $0.10 B       |
| 2024-08-08 | -$0.08  | $0.11 B       |
| 2024-05-06 | -$0.09  | $0.09 B       |
| 2023-11-08 | -$0.08  | $0.07 B       |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.08  | $0.07 B       | *(Note: Duplicate entry.  Likely an error in the data)*

The company consistently reports negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses despite increasing revenue.  The revenue growth is positive, but profitability remains a major concern.

| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B | -9.11%    |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.59B | -6.93%    |

Revenue is growing, but profit margins are relatively stable and ROE remains significantly negative, suggesting ongoing losses and inefficient capital allocation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

RKLB shows exceptional past performance relative to the S&P 500. However, this performance is not reflected in consistent profitability. The company's consistent negative EPS and negative ROE raise significant concerns about long-term sustainability. While revenue growth is positive, the lack of profitability and high beta indicate substantial risk.  Investors should carefully consider the inherent volatility and the need for significant improvement in profitability before making any investment decisions.  Further research into the drivers of the recent surge in performance and the company's plans to achieve profitability are crucial.  The provided data suggests caution is warranted.
