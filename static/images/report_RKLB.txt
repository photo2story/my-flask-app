**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -47.0%  | 51.0%   | -0.38 | -0.1  | 1.6    |
| 2021-2023  | -10.0%  | 51.0%   | -0.28 | -0.0  | 2.4    |

The company showed significant negative returns in the earlier periods (2020-2023), but experienced remarkable growth in the latter periods (2022-2025).  The high beta values indicate significant market sensitivity.  The negative alpha values in earlier years suggest underperformance relative to the market, but this reverses in the most recent years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $18.42
* **Last Market Price:** $17.635 (a decrease of -5.29% from the previous close of $18.62)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $19.456
* **20-day Moving Average:** $18.8718
* **60-day Moving Average:** $24.2174

The recent price shows a short-term decline, falling below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but still significantly above the 60-day average.  The sharp -5.29% drop warrants further investigation for underlying causes.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 48.29 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.6457 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.1 (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** -22.4% (Short-term negative expectation)

The -5.29% price drop in the last market suggests a possible short-term correction. The negative expected return supports the short-term bearish sentiment.  However, the long-term outlook, assuming a two-year plus investment horizon, should consider the significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.1    | $0.10 B       |
| 2024-08-08 | -$0.08   | $0.11 B       |
| 2024-05-06 | -$0.09   | $0.09 B       |
| 2023-11-08 | -$0.08   | $0.07 B       |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.08   | $0.07 B       |

The company consistently shows negative EPS, indicating that it is not yet profitable. Revenue is growing, but at a relatively slow pace compared to the dramatic increase in stock price. This suggests that the market may be pricing in future growth rather than current profitability.  The duplication of the 2024-11-12 entry suggests a data error and requires clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.13B    | 27.81%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.10B    | 26.71%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.11B    | 25.56%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.09B    | 26.06%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.06B    | 25.82%        |

Revenue is showing a steady increase. Profit margins are relatively stable and healthy.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE          |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B    | -13.69%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.42B    | -12.37%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B    | -9.15%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B    | -9.24%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B    | -9.11%        |

Negative ROE across all quarters indicates that the company is not generating returns on equity.  This, in conjunction with the negative EPS, highlights the need for further investigation into the sustainability of the current high valuation.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

RKLB has shown extraordinary growth in the past year, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this growth is accompanied by consistently negative EPS and ROE. The recent price drop signals a potential short-term correction. The high beta suggests significant market risk. While revenue is growing and profit margins are healthy, the current valuation seems to be driven primarily by expectations of future growth rather than current profitability.  Further due diligence is crucial before making any investment decision, focusing on the company's path to profitability and the sustainability of its growth trajectory.  The data discrepancies (duplicate entry in earnings) require correction and clarification.
