**7. Comprehensive Summary**

Rocket Lab (RKLB) has experienced significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by strong recent growth, as reflected in its high CAGR and Alpha. However, this outperformance comes with high volatility, as evidenced by the significant Maximum Drawdown. The technical indicators suggest the stock is currently overbought. The company is not yet profitable, as demonstrated by negative EPS and ROE, but revenue is growing and profit margins are stable. Recent news and analyst discussions point to increased activity and volatility surrounding the stock.

**Overall:** RKLB presents a high-growth, high-risk investment opportunity. While it has demonstrated strong outperformance, the lack of current profitability and high volatility warrant caution.

The negative expected return suggests caution for long-term investment at the current price.
