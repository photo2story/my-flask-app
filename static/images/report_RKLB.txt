**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

RKLB has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  The cumulative return difference highlights this substantial outperformance. However, the Alpha values consistently remain negative, suggesting underperformance relative to the market after adjusting for risk (Beta).  The high Beta values indicate significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  While recent periods show exceptionally high CAGR,  the historical volatility (MDD) is substantial and needs to be considered.  The increasing Beta suggests increasing market sensitivity over time.


| Year       | CAGR      | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -39.0%    | 70.8% | -37.0% | -0.1 | 1.7   |

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $20.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $20.98

The recent closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The significant daily change of 3.93% (Last-market data) indicates a recent sharp price increase (likely a 급반등).

* **RSI:** 65.33 (Approaching overbought territory)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.6 (Short-term uptrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -4.6% (Expected to underperform S&P 500 in the long term)


The combination of a relatively high RSI and positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, but the RSI is nearing overbought levels, implying potential for a correction.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern for long-term investors.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown impressive growth in recent periods, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, this performance comes with significant volatility and negative alpha, suggesting that this outperformance may not be sustainable.  The consistently negative ROE and negative expected return relative to the market are major red flags. While revenue is growing, the company is not yet profitable and has a high beta indicating considerable market risk. Investors should carefully consider the high volatility and the lack of profitability before investing.  The recent price surge warrants caution, and a potential correction should be anticipated given the RSI levels.  Further due diligence, including a thorough analysis of the company's long-term growth prospects and business model, is strongly recommended.
