## Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) is a space launch and satellite company.  The company has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period, but recent price action suggests a potential correction.  While long-term prospects appear promising based on revenue growth and improving margins, profitability remains a concern, highlighted by negative ROE.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Rocket Lab's cumulative return (151.38%) drastically exceeds the S&P 500's (35.27%). The difference (116.1%) places it at the 65.2nd percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, according to the provided data.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -12.0% | 79.7% | -3.0% | -0.1 | 1.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 33.0% | 79.7% | 15.0% | -0.0 | 2.5 |

| 2023-2025  | 147.0% | 86.3% | 110.0% | 0.0 | 8.1 |

**Analysis:**  High volatility (MDD) is evident.  While recent years show impressive CAGR, the negative alpha in earlier periods suggests underperformance relative to the market.  The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  The substantial increase in Beta from 2020-2022 to 2022-2024 reflects increasing market sensitivity.

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downward trend.  The significant negative change (-7.5%) from the previous close suggests a potential short-term correction.

| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B | -9.15% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B | -9.24% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B | -9.11% |

**Analysis:** Revenue is showing consistent growth. Profit margins are relatively stable and healthy. However, the negative ROE across all quarters is a significant concern, indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown remarkable growth compared to the S&P 500, largely driven by revenue growth.  However, the company is still unprofitable (negative EPS and ROE), and the recent price drop and high beta suggest significant risk. The high market risk indicator reinforces this.  While the long-term outlook might be positive given growing revenue and improving margins, investors should exercise caution due to the current lack of profitability and high volatility.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative ROE and the sustainability of revenue growth is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A thorough due diligence process is warranted given the high risk/reward profile.
