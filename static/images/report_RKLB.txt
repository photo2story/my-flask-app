RKLB demonstrates high growth potential but carries significant risk.

Long-term investors should carefully consider the company's path to profitability before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is strongly recommended.  The inconsistent and incomplete financial data provided requires further verification.
