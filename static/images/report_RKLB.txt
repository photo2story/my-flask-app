    | Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
    |------------|--------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
    | 2020-2022  | -38.0% | 82.7%  | -19.0%  | 0.1   | 2.0    |
    | 2021-2023  | 3.0%   | 82.7%  | 2.0%    | 0.1   | 3.0    |
    | 2022-2024  | 210.0% | 82.7%  | 189.0%  | 0.0   | 13.6   |
    | 2023-2025  | 226.0% | 79.6%  | 166.0%  | -0.0  | 21.5   |

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR varies wildly, with negative returns in 2020-2022 and substantial growth in recent periods (2022-2025). This highlights the volatile nature of the stock.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The MDD is consistently high (around 80%), indicating significant risk of loss over the observed periods.
    *   **Alpha:** High alpha values in the recent periods demonstrate significant outperformance relative to the market.
    *   **Beta:** The beta values are close to zero, suggesting that RKLB's price movements are largely independent of the overall market (S&P 500). It is very unusual for a company in a growth sector to have a Beta so low. It seems there is an error in the Beta Calculation.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Cap in Billions have sharply increased in the most recent periods.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close Price:** \$40.30. Recent price movement suggests a slight uptick compared to the previous close.
*   **5-day SMA (41.90) < 20-day SMA (52.57) < 60-day SMA (53.87):** The stock price is currently below its moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend or recent correction. The large drop in the 5-day SMA suggests downward pressure in the last week.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Other Indicators:**

*   **MRI (0.8):** Suggests Medium Investment recommended.
*   **RSI (14.36):**  Extremely oversold. This *could* indicate a potential for a rebound, but should be interpreted with caution in the context of other indicators and news.
*   **PPO (-3.26):** The PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is significantly below the long-term moving average, reinforcing the downtrend signal.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests buying 100% with the available cash, viewing the stock as Very Safe (with MRI:0.9). This recommendation seems contradictory to other indicators and should be cautiously evaluated.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (-8.4):** Indicates a short-term decrease in relative performance compared to the comparison stock.
*   **Expected Return (16.2%):** A high expected return suggests potential long-term profitability, contingent on the company's future performance.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Many of the news headlines reflect concerns about downside risk and potential recovery challenges. The "Shares Slammed 40%" article suggests a significant recent drop in the stock price.
*   **Vanguard Selling Shares:**  Vanguard Group Inc.'s sale of shares adds further negative pressure.
*   **Positive Indicators:** Articles about Rocket Lab's second mission and why the stock is trading up provide some counterbalancing positive signals.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** The analyst consensus is "Buy" with a mean rating of 1.79, implying general optimism.
*   **Target Price:** The average target price of \$65.67 suggests substantial upside potential. However, there's a wide range between the high and low targets, highlighting uncertainty among analysts.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** The lack of information about recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess shifts in analyst sentiment.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Rocket Lab (RKLB) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Strengths:** High growth potential, reflected in strong alpha, increasing revenue, growing profit margins, increasing equity, and positive analyst ratings.
*   **Weaknesses:** High volatility (high MDD), current downtrend (SMA analysis), negative earnings (EPS and ROE), negative news sentiment, and a seemingly erroneous very-low Beta value.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** The "Hybrid Signal" contradicts the negative indicators, suggesting caution in relying solely on that signal.
*   **Key Takeaways:** RKLB is a high-risk, high-reward investment. While the long-term expected return is attractive, the current technical and news environment suggests potential for further short-term downside. Investors should weigh the potential for future growth against the inherent volatility and current negative market sentiment. A small allocation may be more appropriate than a large, concentrated position. The MRI may not be correct.
