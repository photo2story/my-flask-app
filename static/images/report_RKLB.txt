RKLB has shown exceptional growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this growth has been accompanied by substantial volatility and periods of negative Alpha.  Recent negative EPS, while revenue is growing, raises concerns about profitability and long-term sustainability. The recent sharp price drop (-11.21%) signals a significant negative event impacting the stock price.  A thorough fundamental analysis considering the company's growth strategy and path to profitability is necessary before making any investment decisions. The high Beta and negative ROE also caution against significant risk exposure. While the long-term outlook might be positive, given the company's position in a growing market, short-term volatility remains a significant concern.  Further research into the cause of the recent price drop is crucial.
