The high relative return difference suggests this outperformance is exceptionally high compared to its historical volatility.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD (%) | Alpha | Beta | Cap (B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|------|---------|
| 2020-2022  | -52.0%   | 30.6%   | -47.0% | 0.0   | 1.7     |
| 2021-2023  | -18.0%   | 30.6%   | -42.0% | 0.0   | 2.4     |
| 2022-2024  | 328.0%   | 30.6%   | 295.0% | -0.0  | 11.2    |
| 2023-2025  | 393.0%   | 28.5%   | 332.0% | 0.0   | 12.8    |

**Analysis:**  The company experienced significant losses in the earlier years (2020-2023), followed by dramatic gains in subsequent periods. The Beta values suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements, particularly in later periods. The negative alpha in the initial period but substantial positive alpha in the later periods points to periods of both under and outperformance. Note that a negative MDD (maximum drawdown) doesn't make sense unless it is based on a calculation that may not represent MDD correctly.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $29.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $28.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $27.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $23.80

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent sideways movement.  It is significantly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating an upward trend in the last two months. The recent price decrease of -$1.58 shows a short-term price correction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.56 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.32 (Negative value suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** -4.5% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -11.2% (This negative expected return, relative to the S&P 500, seems contradictory to the very high past performance. This needs further clarification.)

The recent price drop is reflected in the negative PPO and the negative change in relative divergence.  The negative expected return likely reflects market sentiment and potential risk given the company's volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue    |
|------------|---------|------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.10  | $0.10B     |
| 2024-08-08 | -$0.08  | $0.11B     |
| 2024-05-06 | -$0.09  | $0.09B     |
| 2023-11-08 | -$0.08  | $0.07B     |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.08  | $0.07B     |  *(Appears to be a duplicate entry)*

**Analysis:** The company is currently reporting negative EPS, indicating losses. However, revenue is generally increasing.  The repeated entry for 2024-11-12 suggests an error in the data.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.10B  | 26.71%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.11B  | 25.56%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.09B  | 26.06%       |

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|---------|------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.42     | -12.37% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46     | -9.15%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.48     | -9.24%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.55     | -9.11%  |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.59     | -6.93%  |

**Analysis:** Revenue is growing, but the company is experiencing negative ROE, indicating it's not yet generating profits on its equity.  Profit margins are relatively stable, suggesting some efficiency in operations.  The declining equity suggests potential investment needs or losses.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB demonstrates a history of extreme volatility, with periods of significant losses followed by massive gains. While the historical return significantly outperformed the S&P 500, the company is currently unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE. The recent price drop and negative technical indicators suggest caution. The high beta indicates substantial market risk.  The provided -11.2% expected return needs further investigation as it contradicts the historical outperformance.  Further analysis including a detailed risk assessment and investigation into the accuracy of the provided data (especially the repeated earnings date and negative MDD) is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Thorough due diligence is essential given the high volatility and current unprofitable state.
