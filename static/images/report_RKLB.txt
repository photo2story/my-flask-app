Rocket Lab has experienced impressive growth and significantly outperformed the S&P 500, driven by a high beta and a positive Alpha, but it has been volatile. Recent indicators suggest a potential short-term pullback amid an overall uptrend.  Analyst consensus remains positive, but concerns about cash flow and some cautionary AI forecasts warrant attention. The company is growing in revenue and improving its profit margin, but it needs to achieve sustained profitability. The high expected return should be balanced against the inherent risk and volatility associated with the stock. Insider sales are also something to watch closely.
