## Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:** Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) is a space launch and satellite company.  While exhibiting significant growth potential (266% cumulative return), it also displays high volatility and considerable risk, as reflected in its negative ROE and beta significantly exceeding 1.  Recent price action suggests a bearish trend, warranting cautious consideration.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

RKLB has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 266.02% compared to VOO's 62.39%.  The current divergence is 203.6%, placing it at the 68.9th percentile of historical divergence (relative to the historical range of -79.2% to 331.1%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and risk:

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha  | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -52.0%   | 30.6%   | -47.0% | 0.0    | 1.7    |
| 2021-2023  | -18.0%   | 30.6%   | -42.0% | 0.0    | 2.5    |
| 2022-2024  | 328.0%  | 30.6%   | 295.0% | -0.0   | 11.4   |
| 2023-2025  | 301.0%  | 28.5%   | 242.0% | 0.0    | 10.6   |

Note the significant swings in CAGR, highlighting the inherent risk.  The consistently high Beta indicates strong price correlation with the overall market, amplified by volatility.  The negative Alpha values in the early years suggest underperformance relative to the market during those periods.  However, the positive alpha in more recent years highlights the significant outperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $23.55
* **Previous Close:** $25.26
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $26.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $28.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $26.40

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price drop of -6.77% indicates a sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 30.13 (Suggests oversold conditions, but not a reliable buy signal in isolation)
* **PPO:** -2.367 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -17.2% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -20.2% (This suggests that, despite past outperformance, the expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative in the long-term. This needs careful scrutiny given the volatility and possible inaccuracies in the projection).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |

| 2024-11-12 | -$0.08   | $0.07B        |


The company consistently reports negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses. While revenue is increasing, the profitability remains a significant concern. The repeated -$0.08 entry for 2024-11-12 suggests a data entry error.

Negative ROE consistently points to a lack of profitability, despite revenue growth. This is a significant red flag.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB's past performance has been exceptional, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this has come with substantial volatility and risk.  The company is currently unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE.  Recent price action shows a bearish trend, supported by technical indicators.  While the long-term potential might be attractive, the considerable risk, negative expected return relative to the market, and the current negative trend necessitates a cautious approach.  Further investigation into the company's future prospects, including its growth strategy and its path to profitability, is crucial before making any investment decision.  The provided long-term expected return projection should be treated with caution due to the high volatility inherent in RKLB.
