## Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) Stock Report

This report analyzes Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB), a space launch and satellite manufacturing company.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

RKLB has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for RKLB is 182.95%, while VOO's is 22.31%.  This represents a substantial difference of 160.6 percentage points.  The relative divergence, considering historical maximum and minimum differences, places RKLB at the 90.3rd percentile relative to VOO. However, this high relative divergence might not be sustainable.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and varying performance depending on the period. Negative Alpha values across periods suggest underperformance relative to the market's risk-adjusted return.  The Beta values show high market sensitivity, especially in the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods, indicating significant price swings correlated with the overall market.  The substantial increase in Beta from 1.7 to 11.8 in the 2022-2024 period indicates a considerable jump in market sensitivity. This change must be investigated further.  The increase in Market Capitalization (Cap) also reflects market perception and potential growth.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

RKLB's recent earnings show consistent negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses. However, revenue is generally increasing, although at a relatively slow pace. Further analysis is needed to assess whether this revenue growth is sufficient to support future profitability.

|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2025-05-08 | -$0.12 | $0.12 B     |

| 2024-08-08 | -$0.08 | $0.11 B     |

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This lack of data is a significant limitation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB exhibits a high degree of volatility and has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the past. However, the negative Alpha values, coupled with the high Beta and the consistent negative EPS, raise concerns about long-term sustainability. The high RSI suggests a potential near-term pullback.  The missing key financial data (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) prevents a solid assessment of the company's financial health.  The significant jump in Beta warrants careful investigation of external factors and market conditions influencing this change.  Investors should proceed with caution and perform thorough due diligence, considering both the high growth potential and substantial risks associated with RKLB.  The long-term expected return of -4.6% relative to the S&P 500 must be considered carefully in light of past performance.  This negative expected return may simply reflect a reversion to the mean, given the unusually high previous performance.
