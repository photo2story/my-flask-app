## Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB), a provider of launch services and space systems, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period.  However, recent earnings show ongoing losses, and limited financial data hinders a comprehensive assessment.  The stock's high relative strength index (RSI) suggests potential overbought conditions.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Rocket Lab's cumulative return (182.95%) vastly surpasses the S&P 500's return (22.31%) over the analyzed period. The large divergence (160.6%) places it at the 90.3rd percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500.  However, this performance is volatile, as indicated by the CAGR and MDD data below.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -39.0%   | 70.8%   | -0.37   | 1.7    |        |
| 2021-2023  | 0.0%    | 71.5%   | -0.19   | 2.5    |        |
| 2022-2024  | 189.0%  | 74.7%   | -0.01   | 11.8   |        |
| 2023-2025  | 202.0%  | 74.7%   | -0.01   | 10.6   |        |

**Analysis:**  The high beta values (1.7-11.8) indicate significantly higher volatility than the S&P 500.  While recent years show extremely high CAGR, the negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market risk taken.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $22.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $20.25

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 65.33 (Approaching overbought territory; above 70 is generally considered overbought)

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date        | EPS      | Revenue      |

| 2024-11-12 | -$0.08   | $0.07 B      | *(Duplicate entry likely an error)*


**Analysis:**  Consistent negative EPS indicates ongoing losses.  Revenue is growing modestly, but profitability remains elusive.  The duplicate entry for November 2024 needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided, limiting a thorough financial analysis.  This lack of data significantly hinders a complete evaluation of the companyâ€™s financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has exhibited exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, but this performance comes with high volatility and negative alpha.  The company is not currently profitable, and the absence of crucial financial data restricts a complete assessment.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term uptrend, but the high RSI warns of overbought conditions.  Further investigation into the company's financials and future growth prospects is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The -4.6% expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term suggests that investors should carefully consider the risk-reward profile before investing.  The high volatility further emphasizes the need for a thorough due diligence process.
