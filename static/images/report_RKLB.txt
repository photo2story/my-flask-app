**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Rocket Lab USA Inc. is a provider of launch and space systems.  The provided data shows RKLB significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, with a final cumulative return difference of 81.2%.  However, the relative difference of 67.5% highlights that this outperformance was not consistently maintained throughout all past periods.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a high beta (ranging from 1.7 to 11.6), indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market movements. Negative alpha values suggest underperformance relative to the market benchmark, especially in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023.  The dramatic shift in beta and CAGR from 2022-2024 suggests a significant change in the company's performance and risk profile during this period.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -31.0% | 75.1% | -34.0% | 1.7 |  |
| 2021-2023  | 8.0%  | 77.8% | -20.0% | 2.5 |  |
| 2022-2024  | 164.0% | 97.8% | 149.0% | 11.6 |  |
| 2023-2025  | 106.0% | 97.8% | 103.0% | 7.4 |  |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $16.37
* **5-day MA:** $17.93
* **20-day MA:** $18.48
* **60-day MA:** $23.32

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The significant drop from the previous close (-8.5%) suggests a potentially sharp downward correction.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 37.74 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** 0.20 (Slightly positive, suggesting some upward momentum, but weak.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -5.0 (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** -10.9% (Significant negative expected return)
* **MRI:** 0.6333 (High Risk)


The combination of a low RSI, negative PPO, negative relative divergence, and a high market risk indicator paints a picture of considerable risk. The substantial price drop (-8.5%) from the previous close reinforces this view. The negative expected return suggests potential for further losses.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company consistently reports negative EPS, although revenue has shown a general upward trend. This suggests operational challenges in translating revenue growth into profitability. Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying drivers of these losses.

**5. Financial Information:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, this outperformance is not consistent across all timeframes, and recent indicators suggest substantial risk. The high beta, negative alpha, negative expected return, and negative ROE raise concerns about the company's financial health and future prospects. While revenue is growing, profitability remains a challenge.  The high market risk indicator and recent price drop warrant caution.  A long-term investment strategy would require careful consideration of the company's ability to achieve sustainable profitability and improve its ROE.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
