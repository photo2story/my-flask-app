Rocket Lab USA Inc. is a leading provider of launch services and space systems.  Over the period analyzed, RKLB significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return exceeding VOO by 130.9%. However, the relative divergence of 76.6% suggests this outperformance is high compared to its historical volatility.  The provided alpha and beta analysis shows highly volatile performance with varying betas (leverage to the market) across different time periods.  High beta in recent periods indicates substantial market sensitivity.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -39.0% | 70.8% | -36.0% | 0.0 | 1.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 0.0% | 71.5% | -17.0% | 0.0 | 2.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 189.0% | 74.7% | 170.0% | 0.0 | 11.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 164.0% | 74.7% | -0.0 | 8.9 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of $19.63 is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change of 0.0 indicates no change from the previous close, and needs further investigation to ensure the absence of significant news driving the price.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 47.79 is near the neutral level (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.  A positive PPO of 1.85 indicates upward momentum. The recent relative divergence shows a short-term upward trend (+14.3). The MRI of 0.47 suggests high risk. The expected return of -6.6% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is negative. This needs further evaluation of the underlying drivers of this projected shortfall.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data show consistent negative EPS, although revenue is growing steadily. This suggests the company is experiencing revenue growth but not yet translating that into profitability.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind this trend.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-12 | -0.1 | 0.10 B$ |
| 2024-08-08 | -0.08 | 0.11 B$ |
| 2024-05-06 | -0.09 | 0.09 B$ |
| 2023-11-08 | -0.08 | 0.07 B$ |
| 2024-11-12 | -0.08 | 0.07 B$ |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is steadily increasing, indicating growth. Profit margins are consistently high, suggesting operational efficiency. However, the negative ROE across all quarters indicates the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  Further investigation is needed to assess the cause of negative ROE despite high profit margins.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.13B | 27.81% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.10B | 26.71% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.11B | 25.56% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.09B | 26.06% |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown exceptional past performance compared to the S&P 500, but recent price action and projections suggest potential near-term weakness.  While revenue is growing, the company is not yet profitable, and the negative ROE is a significant concern. The high beta indicates substantial market sensitivity.  The high Market Risk Indicator further emphasizes the volatility.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of negative ROE and the long-term sustainability of its revenue growth before making any investment decisions.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500, warrants caution.  A deeper dive into the company's financials and future projections is crucial before forming a conclusive opinion.
