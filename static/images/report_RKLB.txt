**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Volatile.  The CAGR varies significantly across the periods, with substantial losses in 2020-2022 but very high growth in the more recent 2022-2025 period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High.  Drawdowns are significant across all periods, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Large positive alpha in the more recent periods (2022-2025) suggests that RKLB's performance isn't solely explained by market movements. Negative alpha in the earlier period (2020-2022) indicates underperformance relative to its risk.
*   **Beta:** Very low or slightly negative. A beta near zero suggests that RKLB's price is not strongly correlated with the overall market.  This could be due to company-specific factors driving the stock price.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Cap):** Increasing. The market capitalization has grown significantly over the observed periods, reflecting investor confidence and/or stock appreciation.

RKLB is a high-growth, high-risk stock.  Its strong historical performance and potential for future growth are attractive, but its current lack of profitability and high volatility are significant risks.

The RSI shows it is oversold, which could be a buying opportunity for a short-term bounce, but long-term investment requires a deep understanding of the company's path to profitability and space sector business opportunities. The recent news headlines highlight the need for careful consideration of both the potential and the risks associated with RKLB.
