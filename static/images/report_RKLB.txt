**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -39.0%  | 70.8%   | -37.0%  | -0.1   | 1.7    |
| 2021-2023  | 0.0%    | 71.5%   | -19.0%  | -0.1   | 2.5    |

| 2023-2025  | 198.0%  | 74.7%   | 182.0%  | -0.1   | 10.2   |

Analysis:  Early years show negative CAGR and substantial Maximum Drawdowns (MDD). However, recent years (2022-2025) exhibit exceptionally high CAGR, suggesting a significant turnaround. Negative alpha values generally indicate underperformance relative to the market benchmark,  but the exceptionally high recent CAGR overshadows this.  The fluctuating beta suggests varying sensitivity to market movements.  Market capitalization has significantly increased.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $22.38
* **5-day Moving Average:** $20.45
* **20-day Moving Average:** $19.25
* **60-day Moving Average:** $21.50

Analysis: The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an uptrend.  The relatively small gap between the 5-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a recent period of relatively steady increase. The recent price increase of 2.29% (from $21.88) shows a slight upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 70.79 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.26 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +11.8% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -4.8% (Expected to underperform S&P 500 over the long term)

Analysis:  The RSI suggests the stock might be overbought, potentially indicating a short-term correction.  However, the positive PPO and upward relative divergence suggest continued bullish momentum in the short term.  The negative long-term expected return, despite past outperformance, warrants caution.  The recent 2.29% price increase aligns with the short-term bullish indicators.

| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B   | -9.11%    |

Analysis:  Revenue is growing, and profit margins remain relatively stable and high.  However, negative ROE across all quarters indicates the company is not generating returns on equity, despite positive profit margins. This requires further investigation into the companyâ€™s capital structure and investment strategy.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

RKLB has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by substantial growth in recent years. However, current financial data show negative EPS and ROE, raising concerns about the sustainability of its growth. The stock shows signs of short-term bullish momentum, but the long-term outlook is less certain due to the negative expected return and negative ROE.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for future growth against the current financial realities and risks before making investment decisions.  Further due diligence, including a thorough analysis of the reasons behind negative EPS and ROE, is crucial before any investment is considered.
