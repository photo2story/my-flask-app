*   The PPO confirms the upward trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a strong buy signal.
*   The negative relative divergence indicates a recent short-term dip in performance relative to the S&P 500, despite the overall outperformance. The recent 10.14 price change likely outweighs this signal and should be examined.
*   The Expected Return suggests modest long-term outperformance potential.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Headlines:** The news is overwhelmingly positive, citing a fresh high, praise from Jim Cramer, a successful launch, and a reiterated "Buy" rating from Needham.

RKLB shows high growth potential and significant recent positive momentum driven by successful launches and positive analyst sentiment.

The stock may be overbought in the short term. Investors should carefully weigh the growth potential against the risks before investing. The Beta = 0 should be verified
