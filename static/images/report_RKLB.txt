**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB exhibits a complex picture. While it has shown remarkable returns exceeding the S&P 500, this performance is highly volatile and its long-term prospects, as indicated by the negative expected return, are uncertain.  The company's continued negative EPS despite growing revenue raises concerns.  The negative ROE suggests the company is not effectively utilizing its equity to generate profits.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with RKLB before investing, particularly given the inconsistent historical performance and negative long-term expected return relative to the market.  Further investigation into the drivers of revenue growth and the reasons for continued losses is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
