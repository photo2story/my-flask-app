*   **Beta:** The beta values are very low, hovering near zero or even negative. This means RKLB is not closely correlated with the overall market.

*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The positive change in relative divergence indicates a short-term increase compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 9.1% is promising, suggesting potential long-term profitability, but it should be viewed in the context of the company's inherent risk.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events Analysis**

*   **Mixed News:** The news headlines present a mixed picture. Some articles highlight the stock's plunge despite success, others focus on the stock's surge.
