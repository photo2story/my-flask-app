**7. 종합 Analysis (Overall Analysis)**

Rocket Lab (RKLB) is experiencing significant positive momentum. Recent news, particularly the NASA contract, has driven a substantial price surge, reflected in the high RSI and positive divergence. The Market Risk Indicator also suggests a favorable investment environment.  However, the current price is above analyst target prices, and the RSI indicates an overbought condition, implying a potential pullback. While revenue is growing, consistent negative EPS and negative ROE raise concerns about profitability. The long-term expected return is positive.

**Conclusion:**

RKLB presents a mixed picture.  The strong growth, positive news flow, and high MRI suggest continued upside potential. However, investors should be cautious of the overbought condition, potential overvaluation relative to analyst targets, and the company's current lack of profitability (negative ROE). The stock has experienced 급반등, a rapid surge, and it's crucial to assess whether this momentum is sustainable. While long-term prospects might be positive, careful monitoring and risk management are essential.
