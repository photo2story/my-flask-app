The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price drop of -$0.75  indicates some negative market pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 30.69 (Suggests the stock is potentially oversold.)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -11.0% (Short-term downward trend.)

This significantly negative expected return warrants further investigation into its basis.  It may reflect current market sentiment and is not necessarily a definitive prediction.

The negative price change and the low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum.  The negative expected return highlights substantial risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.1 | $0.10 B     |
| 2024-08-08 | -$0.08| $0.11 B     |
| 2024-05-06 | -$0.09| $0.09 B     |

| 2024-11-12 | -$0.08| $0.07 B     | *(Likely a duplicate entry)*

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|

| 2024-09-30 | $0.10B | 26.71% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.11B | 25.56% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.09B | 26.06% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.06B | 25.82% |

Revenue shows a generally upward trend.  Profit margins are relatively stable and positive despite negative EPS. This discrepancy may require examination of non-GAAP accounting practices.

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.38B | -13.69% |

| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B | -9.24% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B | -9.11% |

Equity is decreasing, and ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on equity.  This is a significant concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown remarkable past performance compared to the S&P 500, but recent indicators suggest a bearish trend.  While revenue is growing, the company is consistently unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE.  The significant negative expected return is a major red flag. The high volatility and negative financial metrics warrant caution.  Further investigation into the details of the provided data, especially the discrepancies and the basis for the negative expected return, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  More thorough due diligence including an analysis of future projections, debt levels, and competitive landscape is required.
