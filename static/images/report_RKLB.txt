## Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:** Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) is a space launch and satellite manufacturing company.  Its stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the specified period, showing high volatility and a recent decline in price.  While profitability remains elusive, revenue is growing, but negative ROE raises concerns.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Rocket Lab's cumulative return (118.42%) substantially exceeds the S&P 500's (39.65%).  The difference (78.8%) places it at the 55.8th percentile of its historical range (max 195.8%, min -69.2%). This suggests significant outperformance but also high volatility.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -47.0% | 51.0%  | -0.38 | -0.1  | 1.7    |
| 2021-2023  | -10.0% | 51.0%  | -0.28 | -0.0  | 2.5    |

| 2023-2025  | 147.0% | 67.9%  | 1.06  | -0.0  | 8.2    |

The high beta values (especially 2022-2024) indicate significant market sensitivity.  Negative alpha in earlier years shifted to strongly positive alpha in more recent years, reflecting the substantial price increase.  However, the volatility (MDD) remains high.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown significant short-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500, driven by substantial price appreciation. However, this has been accompanied by high volatility and negative EPS. While revenue is increasing and profit margins are positive, the consistently negative ROE raises serious concerns about long-term sustainability and profitability. The recent price decline and bearish technical indicators suggest caution.  The -23.8% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term suggests that past outperformance may not be sustainable.  Further investigation into the reasons for negative ROE and the long-term growth strategy is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with this stock.
