## Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) Stock Analysis

**0) Summary Statistics:**

Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) is a space launch and satellite company.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), but with high volatility. Recent price action suggests a potential downward trend.  Earnings are negative, but revenue is growing, and profitability metrics indicate improvement.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

RKLB's cumulative return (156.36%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (10.87%) over the analyzed period. The relative divergence is currently 145.5%, placing it at the 82.8th percentile of its historical range (max: 186.2%, min: -50.2%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and beta values that fluctuate significantly from year to year (0.0 to 11.2). This indicates high sensitivity to market movements, particularly in recent years.  The substantial positive CAGR in the last two years suggests a rapidly improving market position, potentially explaining the large divergence from the S&P 500. The negative alphas suggest it underperforms the market adjusted for risk.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $20.59
* **Last Market Price:** $19.88 (a decrease of -3.45 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $17.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $18.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $22.94

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent drop of -3.45% may indicate a short-term correction or a larger downward trend.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4271 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.43 (slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.2667 (positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +10.0 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -5.6% (short-term)

The MRI suggests relatively low risk.  While the PPO shows bullish momentum, the negative expected return and the price being below moving averages counter this.  The recent price drop (-3.45%) reflects a notable negative short-term change, potentially indicating a short-term correction rather than a full-fledged bearish trend.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to S&P 500 is not provided.

| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B    | -9.11%        |


Revenue is steadily increasing. While profit margins are healthy, the negative ROE indicates the company is not yet generating sufficient returns on its equity. The decreasing equity might be due to share buybacks or other financial activities, requiring further investigation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

RKLB demonstrates significant growth potential, evidenced by its strong outperformance against the S&P 500. However, this is accompanied by considerable volatility, reflected in high beta values and the wide range of its relative divergence.  While recent earnings show net losses, revenue is increasing, and profit margins are healthy.  Negative ROE suggests inefficiency in capital utilization. The short-term price action shows a bearish trend, likely a correction given the longer-term performance.  More detailed financial analysis and a clearer understanding of the reasons behind the fluctuating equity and negative ROE are needed to make a comprehensive assessment.  Long-term investors may find the opportunity attractive despite the short-term volatility, provided that the company's growth trajectory continues.  However, careful risk management is essential due to the company's inherent volatility.
