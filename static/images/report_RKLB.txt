## Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) is a leading provider of launch services and space systems. This report analyzes RKLB's performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO) and examining key financial metrics.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **RKLB Cumulative Return:** 350.02%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 65.16%
* **Return Difference:** 284.9%
* **Relative Divergence:** 88.7% (This indicates RKLB's performance significantly outpaces VOO historically, falling within the top 88.7% of its historical performance relative to VOO.)

The table below shows RKLB's significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over various periods, particularly in recent years.  However,  the high beta values suggest significant market volatility.  The negative alpha values (except for 2022-2024) suggests that  RKLB's returns don't consistently exceed expectations adjusted for market risk.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -52.0%  | 30.6%   | -47.0% | 0.0   | 1.7   |
| 2021-2023  | -18.0%  | 30.6%   | -42.0% | 0.0   | 2.5   |
| 2022-2024  | 328.0% | 30.6%   | 295.0% | -0.0  | 11.6  |
| 2023-2025  | 385.0% | 28.5%   | 0.0   | 13.0  |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $28.53
* **Last Market Price:** $29.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $29.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $27.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $23.51

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting some short-term downward pressure, but above the 20-day and 60-day averages, indicating a potential upward trend.  The recent price increase from the previous close is notable.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 53.05 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.196 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -11.3% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -11.9% (Relative to S&P 500)

The recent price increase of 1.82% needs to be considered within the context of the negative PPO and downward relative divergence.  The negative expected return suggests underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |

| 2024-11-12 | -$0.08 | $0.07 B      | *(Note: This line appears duplicated)*


The company is currently unprofitable, with consistent negative EPS.  Revenue is showing some growth, but profitability remains a concern.  The duplicated entry for 2024-11-12 needs clarification.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.10B    | 26.71%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.11B    | 25.56%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.09B    | 26.06%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.06B    | 25.82%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity    | ROE           |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.42B    | -12.37%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B    | -9.15%        |

| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B    | -9.11%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.59B    | -6.93%        |

Revenue shows some growth, but profit margins are relatively stable.  However, the negative ROE indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity.  This is a significant concern.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has demonstrated exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500 over certain periods, but this is coupled with high volatility (high beta) and generally negative alpha, indicating inconsistent outperformance. The company is currently unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE, raising significant concerns about its long-term sustainability. While revenue growth is present, the negative financial metrics suggest caution.  The short-term price action is mixed, with recent upward movement but negative technical indicators suggesting a potential downward correction.  The high relative divergence suggests the stock may be overvalued compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. A thorough risk assessment is crucial before investing in RKLB, given the current financial situation and the volatile nature of the company.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the high past returns and the current lack of profitability is warranted.
