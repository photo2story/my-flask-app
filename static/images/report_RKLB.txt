*   **Analysis:**
    *   **High Outperformance & Volatility:** RKLB has delivered exceptional returns over the past few years, particularly in the most recent periods (2022-2024, 2023-2025).  However, this comes with very high volatility, as evidenced by the substantial Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures.
    *   **Increasing Capitalization:**  The market capitalization (Cap) has grown significantly, reflecting investor confidence and the company's growth.
    *   **Negative Beta:** A negative beta suggests RKLB's price movement is inversely correlated with the overall market. However, given the low beta values, this correlation is weak and might not be statistically significant. The stock's performance is likely driven by company-specific factors rather than broader market trends.
    *   **Strong Alpha:**  The high positive Alpha indicates that RKLB has significantly outperformed its expected return based on its beta and the market's performance.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.341 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 80.17 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 1.32

*   **Expected Return:** -2.8% (Long-term vs. S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Overbought:** The RSI above 70 indicates the stock is overbought and could be due for a pullback.
    *   **Low Risk (MRI):** Despite the high volatility and overbought conditions, the Market Risk Indicator suggests low overall risk.  This might be due to specific factors considered by the MRI calculation (e.g., strong financials, industry outlook).
    *   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) is positive, confirming the upward momentum.
    *   **Recent Divergence Increase:** The increasing relative divergence suggests continued short-term outperformance.
    *   **Expected Return Warning:** The negative expected return indicates that, despite recent outperformance, long-term projections (2+ years) suggest RKLB might not outperform the S&P 500 from this point onward if investing based on a dollar cost averaging approach.

**7. Overall Summary**

RKLB has demonstrated impressive growth and significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, driven by strong revenue growth and operational efficiency. However, the stock is highly volatile, potentially overbought, and currently unprofitable. While recent news and analyst discussions highlight both opportunities and risks, the negative expected return suggests caution for long-term dollar-cost averaging investment strategies from the current price level. Investors should monitor upcoming news, earnings reports, and industry developments closely. Given the high RSI, a pullback is possible in the short term. The company's financial health, while showing improvements in revenue and profit margin, still needs to achieve profitability. The combination of high growth, high volatility, and unprofitability makes RKLB a high-risk, high-reward investment.
