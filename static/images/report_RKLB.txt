However, the performance dramatically improved in the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods, with very high CAGR and Alpha, implying strong outperformance relative to the market.

*   **Last Market Change:** -0.79 (Slight decrease compared to previous close)
*   **Moving Averages:**

    *   20-day: 47.7745
    *   60-day: 45.5322
*   **Analysis:** The stock is trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages but above its 60-day moving average.  This suggests a recent short-term downward trend, but the price is still supported by a longer-term (60-day) trend.

*   **Expected Return:** 3.4% (Expected outperformance relative to S&P 500 with long-term investment)

*   **Analysis:** While the RSI and PPO indicate some short-term weakness, the MRI and Hybrid Signal strongly recommend investment.  The recent price decrease (-0.79) isn't drastic but worth noting for potential short-term volatility. The positive change in relative divergence suggests a potential for upward momentum in the near term.

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has generally been increasing. Profit margins have improved over the past five quarters, reaching 32.10% in the most recent quarter. However, ROE (Return on Equity) remains negative, indicating that the company is not generating profits from its equity. Equity had initially decreased, but increased dramatically in the last quarter.

**7. Overall Summary**

Rocket Lab exhibits a mixed profile:

*   **Positive:**  High accumulated return compared to S&P 500 (but very volatile history), strong recent CAGR and Alpha, high MRI score and positive Hybrid Signal, potential for future outperformance (3.4% expected return), increasing revenue and improving profit margins. Analyst consensus is 'Buy'.
*   **Negative:** Recent stock underperformance, insider selling by the CFO, negative EPS and ROE, analyst target price only slightly above current price, recent negative headlines.

**Investment Recommendation:**

Despite the positive MRI score and Hybrid Signal, the recent insider selling, negative earnings, and mixed news suggest caution.  The company has high growth potential but also carries significant risk. A long-term, buy-and-hold strategy with a small allocation might be appropriate for investors with a high-risk tolerance, but further due diligence is recommended. The significant CFO stock sale is a major red flag that should be investigated further before making any investment decisions.
