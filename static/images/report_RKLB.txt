## Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) Stock Report

**0) Summary Statistics:**

Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) is a provider of launch services and spacecraft components.  The company shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  However, recent financial data reveals ongoing profitability challenges.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **RKLB Cumulative Return:** 162.33%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 13.42%
* **Return Difference:** 148.9%
* **Relative Divergence:** 84.2% (This indicates that RKLB's performance is significantly above the VOO,  but relative to its historical maximum and minimum divergence from VOO).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile performance with high beta, indicating significant sensitivity to market movements.  Alpha is consistently near zero, suggesting that the outperformance is primarily due to market timing rather than company-specific factors.  The high beta, particularly in 2022-2024, reflects the company's exposure to market risk. The increasing beta may indicate increased market sensitivity over time.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -39.0%   | 70.8%    | -36.0% | 0.0   | 1.7    |
| 2021-2023  | 0.0%     | 71.5%    | -17.0% | 0.0   | 2.5    |
| 2022-2024  | 189.0%   | 74.7%    | 170.0% | 0.0   | 11.6   |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $20.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $18.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $22.63

The price is currently below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. However, the price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages which might suggest some short-term bullish momentum, although the substantial 10.14% change from the previous close suggests considerable volatility.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 55.55 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 2.29 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +16.8% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -5.3% (Negative expected return relative to the S&P 500).  This negative return is concerning given the significant initial outperformance.

The significant price increase of 10.14% from the previous close indicates a recent sharp upward movement.  This should be considered when evaluating the current technical indicators.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by high volatility and consistent negative earnings. The high beta underscores the substantial market risk involved. While revenue is growing and profit margins are relatively stable, the negative ROE and lack of profitability are significant concerns.  The projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 raises serious questions about the sustainability of past performance.  Further investigation into the drivers of recent price increases and the company's long-term profitability strategy is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The considerable volatility warrants caution.  More data is needed to clarify the conflicting revenue figures presented in the earnings data.
