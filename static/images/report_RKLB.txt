| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -39.0%   | 70.8%  | -0.37 | -0.1 | 1.7    |

* **Analysis:** The company has shown significant volatility, with periods of substantial losses and gains. The negative alpha in most periods suggests underperformance relative to the market risk. The high beta consistently indicates high sensitivity to market movements.  The significant jump in CAGR and market capitalization from 2022-2024 suggests a major turning point for the company.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $18.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $21.72

* **Analysis:** The recent closing price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average indicating a potential pullback from higher prices. The significant daily change (6.57%) indicates a recent surge in price.

* **Analysis:** The indicators paint a mixed picture.

The daily price change of 6.57% reflects a notable recent surge, potentially implying a short-term price fluctuation.
