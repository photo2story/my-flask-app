## Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) Stock Analysis

**0) Introduction:**

Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) is a provider of launch services and spacecraft components for the aerospace industry.  This report analyzes RKLB's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering recent price movements, financial statements, and key indicators.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

RKLB's cumulative return significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The provided data shows:

* **RKLB Cumulative Return:** 188.64%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 52.70%
* **Return Difference:** 135.9%  This places the current relative divergence at the 52.4th percentile of the historical range (-79.2% to 331.1%).  Note that this does not indicate a 52.4% outperformance, but rather its position within the historical range of outperformance/underperformance relative to the VOO.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided alpha and beta values show high volatility and varying betas across the specified periods. This suggests a significant relationship with overall market performance (Beta), but unpredictable periods of outperformance or underperformance (Alpha). Notably, the high beta in 2022-2024 (11.6) indicates a strong sensitivity to market movements during that period.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD (%) | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|--------|--------|---------|
| 2020-2022  | -52.0%   | 30.6%   | -47.0% | 0.0    | 1.7     |
| 2021-2023  | -18.0%   | 30.6%   | -42.0% | 0.0    | 2.5     |
| 2022-2024  | 328.0%  | 30.6%   | 295.0% | -0.0   | 11.6    |
| 2023-2025  | 223.0%  | 29.2%   | 174.0% | 0.0    | 8.5     |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $18.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $19.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $23.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $25.65

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent price increase of 0.75% from the previous close could be a temporary bounce or the beginning of a trend reversal, requiring further observation.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (21.61):**  Indicates oversold conditions, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-2.49):**  Shows negative momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-5.5%):** Suggests a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (-33.4%):** This implies a significantly lower expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  The recent price increase (0.75%) is not reflected in the negative expected return. This discrepancy needs further investigation to understand the contributing factors.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently reported negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  Revenue shows a slight upward trend, but profitability remains elusive.

| Date        | EPS  | Revenue      |
|-------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -0.1 | $0.10 B      |

| 2024-11-12 | -0.08 | $0.07 B      |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is growing, but profit margins are relatively stable, indicating efficiency in operations. However, negative ROE consistently points to a concern about the company's ability to generate returns on its equity. This negative ROE is significant and needs further investigation into the underlying causes.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown significant past outperformance relative to the S&P 500, however, the current indicators present a mixed picture. While the recent price increase is positive, the negative expected return, negative EPS, and negative ROE raise concerns about long-term sustainability. The company's high beta suggests high market sensitivity.  Further analysis is needed to determine if the recent price movement reflects a sustainable trend reversal or a temporary bounce within a larger bearish trend.  Investors should carefully consider the risks associated with this volatile stock and assess if the potential for future growth outweighs the present financial challenges.  A deep dive into the reasons behind the negative ROE is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
