| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -38.0% | 82.7%  | -18.0%  | 0.1    | 2.0    |

| 2023-2025  | 449.0% | 79.6%  | 382.0%  | -0.0   | 37.7   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows a dramatic improvement over the periods. The most recent period (2023-2025) indicates exceptional growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD across all periods indicates significant price volatility and potential risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is strong and positive in recent periods (2022-2025 and 2023-2025), indicating the stock is generating returns above what would be expected based on market movements (S&P 500).
*   **Beta:** Beta is low to negligible, which means the stock's price movements have not been correlated with the overall market. This could be seen as a positive, indicating more independent performance, but it also means its success is less tied to general economic trends.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** Rapidly growing, suggesting increasing investor confidence and company valuation.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $70.65

*   **5-day SMA:** $74.62
*   **20-day SMA:** $57.72
*   **60-day SMA:** $56.93

**Analysis:** The recent price drop (-$8.46) is significant. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting an upward trend, but the recent price action could be a reversal of that trend.

**Analysis:**
*   The MRI is high, suggesting a favorable investment environment according to this indicator.
*   The RSI approaching 70 suggests the stock is nearing overbought conditions and may experience a price correction soon.
*   The PPO confirms the recent bullish momentum.
*   The hybrid signal is based on a model that currently suggests purchasing a significant portion of cash.
*   The short-term increase in relative divergence (15.7 (+)) further supports the recent outperformance.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Rocket Lab has experienced extraordinary recent growth, outperforming the S&P 500 significantly. Strong Alpha and CAGR figures support this. However, the MDD is high, indicating significant volatility. The recent price pullback, coupled with a mixed sentiment in news headlines and RSI nearing overbought levels, suggests a potential short-term correction.

*   **Positives:** Strong revenue growth, improving profit margins, improving (but still negative) EPS, positive analyst consensus, significant Space Force contract.
*   **Negatives:** High MDD, ROE still negative, RSI approaching overbought, potential for short-term pullback based on technical indicators, mixed news sentiment, average analyst target price slightly below the current price.

**Overall:**

RKLB is a high-growth, high-risk stock. The company appears to be executing well, demonstrated by revenue and margin improvements, and benefits from a substantial contract. However, the high volatility and lack of profitability remain concerns.

**Investment Recommendation:**

*   **For Risk-Tolerant Investors:** RKLB could be considered for a small portion of a diversified portfolio, given its growth potential. However, it's essential to be prepared for significant price swings.
*   **For Conservative Investors:** Due to the volatility and lack of current profitability, RKLB is not suitable for conservative investors.
*   **Important Considerations:** Closely monitor upcoming earnings reports and news for signs of continued revenue growth and progress towards profitability. Pay attention to technical indicators and market sentiment for potential entry and exit points. The high relative divergence suggests being cautious, as mean reversion could occur.
