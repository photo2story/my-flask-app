Rocket Lab (RKLB) has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, driven by impressive revenue growth. However, the company is not yet profitable, as indicated by negative EPS and ROE. The high RSI suggests the stock is overbought and could be due for a correction. Recent news points to significant activity and volatility, which investors should monitor closely. While the long-term expected return is negative, the company's growth trajectory and potential in the space industry could still present opportunities, but also increased risk.
