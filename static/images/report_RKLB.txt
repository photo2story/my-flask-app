**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -52.0% | 30.6%  | -0.0  | 1.7   |        |
| 2021-2023  | -18.0% | 30.6%  | -0.0  | 2.5   |        |
| 2022-2024  | 328.0% | 30.6%  | -0.0  | 11.4  |        |
| 2023-2025  | 375.0% | 28.5%  | 0.0   | 12.7  |        |

The data shows extremely high volatility and beta (market sensitivity), especially in recent periods.  The negative CAGRs in earlier periods highlight the considerable risk involved in RKLB. The significantly high beta suggests that RKLB's price movements are amplified compared to the overall market. Alpha consistently near zero indicates that the company hasn't generated significant returns above what would be expected based on its beta and market performance.  The missing capitalization data hinders a complete assessment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $28.30
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $28.43 (slightly below)
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $28.59 (slightly below)
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $25.91 (above)

The price is currently trading below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term bearish pressure. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, hinting at potential longer-term support.  The recent price increase of 2.46% suggests a potential short-term bullish reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.99 (approaching oversold territory, but not yet)
* **PPO:** -0.97 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.1 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -12.6% (This suggests a lower expected return than the S&P 500 over the long term)

The RSI is nearing oversold conditions, but not definitively so. The negative PPO confirms bearish momentum.  The positive relative divergence change is a short-term signal only. The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 should be carefully considered, indicating potential underperformance relative to market benchmarks.

| 2023-09-30 | $0.59B      | -6.93%        |

Revenue is growing, while profit margins remain relatively stable and positive. However, the negative ROE consistently indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity. This is a significant concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500, but this is accompanied by extremely high volatility and risk.  The company is currently unprofitable, with negative EPS and ROE. While revenue is increasing, the negative profitability raises serious concerns about long-term sustainability.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity, making it a risky investment.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 further supports this conclusion.  Investors should carefully consider these risks before investing in RKLB.  More detailed financial information and a clearer understanding of future growth prospects are necessary for a comprehensive investment decision.  The current situation, while exciting due to the high returns,  suggests that RKLB is currently a high-risk, high-reward investment, unsuitable for risk-averse investors.
