**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Rocket Lab USA Inc. is a space launch and satellite manufacturing company.

RKLB's cumulative return vastly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The relative divergence of 85% shows RKLB's performance is in the top 85% of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals significant volatility.  While showing impressive returns (especially in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods), the high Beta values (especially 11.4 and 12.6) indicate high sensitivity to market movements.  The negative Alpha values in some years suggest underperformance relative to the market,  while others shows it strongly outperformed the market. Negative alpha values might also be attributed to the high Beta.  This high Beta suggests that considerable risk is associated with RKLB investments.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -52.0% | 30.6% | -47.0% | 0.0 | 1.7 |
| 2021-2023  | -18.0% | 30.6% | -42.0% | 0.0 | 2.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 328.0% | 30.6% | 295.0% | -0.0 | 11.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 370.0% | 28.5% | 308.0% | 0.0 | 12.6 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $28.02
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $28.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $28.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $26.06

The price is currently below its short-term moving averages (5-day and 20-day), suggesting potential downward pressure.  However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.47 (Slightly below neutral; not oversold but approaching it)
* **PPO:** -0.99 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +1.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -12.9% (This suggests a potential underperformance against the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon, despite past outperformance.  Careful consideration of the high beta is crucial here.)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest caution. The positive relative divergence change indicates recent strength, but the overall technical picture is mixed.  The significant negative expected return against the S&P 500 is a key concern.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -0.1   | $0.10 B     |

| 2023-11-08 | -0.08  | $0.07 B     |
| 2024-11-12 | -0.08  | $0.07 B     | *(Duplicate Entry - Likely an error in the data)*

The company is currently unprofitable, with consistent negative EPS.  Revenue is growing, but not rapidly.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.

| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B | -9.11% |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.59B | -6.93% |

Negative ROE indicates the company is not generating returns on shareholder equity.  While equity is relatively stable, the negative ROE is a significant concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown exceptionally high returns compared to the S&P 500 historically. However, this comes with substantial volatility (high Beta) and currently negative EPS and ROE.  The recent price action suggests potential downward pressure, and technical indicators point to a mixed outlook. While revenue shows growth, profitability remains a major issue. The negative expected return highlights the risk involved and the need for careful consideration before investment.  A long-term, dollar-cost averaging strategy *might* mitigate some risk, but the high Beta requires acknowledging the potential for significant losses. Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative ROE and the duplicate entry in the earnings data is essential.
