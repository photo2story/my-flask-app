**1. Performance Comparison and Company Overview:**

Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) is a space launch and satellite manufacturing company.  Over the observed period, RKLB dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a significantly higher cumulative return.  The substantial difference, however, needs to be considered in light of its higher risk profile, as evidenced by the high relative divergence and volatility shown in the provided data.  The alpha consistently negative values, while beta values are considerably above 1, points to significantly higher risk and volatility than the market. While high returns were achieved in the last couple of years, this may be related to specific periods, requiring attention to potential long-term sustainability.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -39.0% | 70.8% | -0.37 | 1.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 0.0% | 71.5% | -0.19 | 2.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 189.0% | 74.7% | 0.00 | 11.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 198.0% | 74.7% | -0.18 | 10.2 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $22.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $20.45
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $19.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $21.50

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively small gap between the 5-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a relatively stable price trend during the last two months.  However, the provided daily price increase of 2.29% suggests a recent rapid upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Risk Assessment:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 70.79 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.26 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +11.8% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -4.8% (This is concerning and needs further investigation; It suggests a potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.)

The RSI approaching 70 suggests the stock might be overbought in the short term, indicating a potential correction.  However, the positive PPO and the recent price surge signal continued upward momentum. The large daily price change (2.29%) shows a sharp upward movement, potentially indicating a short-term overreaction. The negative long-term expected return, however, raises concerns about sustainability.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.1  | $0.10 B       |
| 2024-08-08 | -$0.08 | $0.11 B       |
| 2024-05-06 | -$0.09 | $0.09 B       |
| 2023-11-08 | -$0.08 | $0.07 B       |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.08 | $0.07 B       | *(Likely a duplicate entry)*


The company is currently not profitable, showing consistent negative EPS. Revenue is growing but at a slow pace.  The duplicated entry needs clarification.  Profitability is concerning and needs a further examination into the underlying causes.


**5. Financial Information:**

| 2024-06-30 | $0.46B | -9.15% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.48B | -9.24% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.55B | -9.11% |

Revenue is increasing, showing growth, but the consistently negative ROE is a significant concern. Profit margins are relatively stable but low in a context of negative ROE. This requires a deeper dive into the company's expenses and capital structure.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown impressive returns compared to the S&P 500, but this performance is accompanied by high volatility and risk.  The company is currently unprofitable, despite growing revenue.  While short-term indicators suggest upward momentum, the negative long-term expected return and negative ROE raise serious concerns about the sustainability of its performance.  Further investigation is needed to assess the long-term viability of the company and the factors driving its recent price surge.  A comprehensive analysis of the company's expenses, capital allocation strategy, and future growth prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data alone is insufficient to make a definitive recommendation.
