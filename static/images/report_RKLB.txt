**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500,  primarily driven by its high volatility and high sensitivity to market movements (high beta).  However, the company is currently unprofitable with negative EPS and ROE, despite showing revenue growth.  The recent price surge needs to be examined closely for underlying drivers. The high risk associated with RKLB is reflected in the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500.  Investors should carefully assess the risk tolerance before investing in RKLB given its high volatility and lack of profitability.  Further analysis of the company's future prospects and competitive landscape is crucial for a complete investment decision.  The duplicate data entry and a lack of information on the time frame of the provided analysis limit this assessment.
