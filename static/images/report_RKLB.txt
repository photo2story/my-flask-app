| --------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ---- | ------ |
| 2021-2023 | 3.0%    | 98.4%  | 3.0%   | 1.8  | 3.0    |

| 2023-2025 | 443.0%  | 99.6%  | 380.0% | 2.2  | 37.3   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR has increased significantly over the evaluation periods, reflecting strong growth trajectory.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Very high MDD values near 100% indicates extremely high risk and volatility associated with the stock.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha values are very high, indicating significant outperformance relative to the market (S&P 500) after accounting for risk.
*   **Beta:**  Beta values above 1 suggest the stock is more volatile than the market.  The increasing Beta indicates the stock's volatility is trending higher.
*   **Cap(B):** Shows the increasing capitalization of the company over time.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 69.76
*   **Last Market:** Price: 69.76, Previous Close: 70.45, Change: -0.98
*   **5-day SMA:** 71.63
*   **20-day SMA:** 61.94
*   **60-day SMA:** 57.56

**Analysis:** The stock price closed lower than the previous close, indicating a slight recent pullback. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, which *could* indicate an upward trend *in the very short term*, but the 20-day SMA being well above the 60-day SMA also indicates a stronger intermediate-term upward trend. The recent price drop, despite the overall positive SMA structure, warrants caution.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended). This suggests a moderate level of risk based on the model.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 62.81. This is slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting a slight bullish bias, but not overbought.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.11. This indicates a positive short-term trend relative to a longer-term trend, supporting the SMA observations.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (3 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80). A strong buy signal with an indication to invest a significant amount of available cash.
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -11.3 (-). A negative value suggests a recent short-term decline in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Price Change & Fluctuation:** The information {'price': 69.76, 'previousClose': 70.45, 'change': -0.98} suggests a small recent decline, but not a dramatic fluctuation.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 124.16%.  A very high expected return compared to the S&P 500 is predicted if held for more than 2 years.

**Analysis:**  The technical indicators present a mixed picture. The RSI and PPO suggest some positive momentum, but the recent decline in relative divergence is a cautionary sign.  The MRI indicates medium risk. The hybrid signal is a very strong buy signal. The very high expected return is attractive, but should be viewed with caution considering the historical volatility.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **AI Analyst Cautious for 2026 (TipRanks):** This raises concerns about future performance based on AI analysis.
*   **Insider Sale (ts2.tech):** Insider sales can sometimes negatively impact investor sentiment.
*   **Cash Flow Concerns (Seeking Alpha):**  A key issue highlighted is that while the company has high growth potential, it currently faces cash flow challenges.
*   **Potential Breakout Year in 2026 (MarketBeat):**  This article presents a more optimistic outlook for future growth.
*   **"What's Happening With Rocket Lab Stock Wednesday?" (Benzinga):**  This suggests there's been noticeable recent price movement/interest in the stock.
*   **Cathie Wood Trims Position (TipRanks):** Cathie Wood reducing her position could signal a change in her investment thesis, although it might also be for portfolio management reasons.

**Analysis:**  The news is mixed. There is positive sentiment about the long-term potential, but concerns about cash flow and one analyst's cautious outlook for 2026.  The insider sale and Cathie Wood's trim are worth noting, but don't necessarily indicate a definitive negative trend.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.79 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Opinions:** 12 analysts
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 68.75, High: 90.00, Low: 47.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent rating changes were given.

**Analysis:**  The analyst consensus is "Buy," but the average target price (68.75) is *below* the current price (69.76). This suggests that, on average, analysts see limited near-term upside, and perhaps even a potential for a slight decline to the average target price. The wide range between the high and low target prices (47.00 to 90.00) reflects significant uncertainty in the stock's future valuation.
