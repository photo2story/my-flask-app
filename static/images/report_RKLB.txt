## Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Rocket Lab USA Inc. is a leading provider of launch services and space systems.  The company shows significant divergence from the S&P 500, outperforming it substantially.  However, it also exhibits high volatility and risk.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

RKLB's cumulative return (94.54%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's return (13.38%) over the analyzed period. The  divergence is substantial (81.2 points, representing the 67.5th percentile of historical divergence).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a high beta (especially in 2022-2024), indicating high sensitivity to market movements. Negative alphas across all periods suggest underperformance relative to the market after accounting for risk, despite the high overall cumulative return.  This suggests that while RKLB has outperformed the S&P 500 in terms of total return, this performance may be largely due to market-related factors and potentially unsustainable.

| 2020-2022  | -31.0%   | 75.1%   | -0.34  | 1.7   |        |

Long-term excess return is dependent on various factors including future performance, the trajectory of the S&P 500, and overall market conditions.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

RKLB is currently unprofitable, with negative EPS in all reported quarters. While revenue has shown some growth, it's not yet translating into profits.  Further investigation into the reasons for persistent losses is necessary.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -0.1   | $0.10 B     |

Revenue is growing, but profitability remains a concern.  The company shows consistently negative ROE, indicating that it's not generating sufficient returns on invested capital.  High equity levels may be due to funding rounds but don't reflect strong profitability.

| 2024-12-31 | $0.13B  | 27.81%        |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown impressive growth in cumulative returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this performance is coupled with high risk (high beta, negative alpha, high market risk indicator), and the company is currently operating at a loss. Recent price action indicates a bearish trend, supported by technical indicators.  While revenue growth is positive, the lack of profitability and negative ROE raise significant concerns about long-term sustainability.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk involved before investing in RKLB.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
