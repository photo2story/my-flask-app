This highlights the inherent risk in investing in RKLB.

However, the long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is not explicitly provided and would require further analysis based on various scenarios and risk tolerances.  The large negative change needs to be considered as a potential significant issue.  This could represent a significant buying opportunity for a long-term investor if this is a temporary setback.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, but this comes with considerable risk. The high volatility, negative ROE, and consistent negative EPS highlight significant uncertainty. While the recent revenue growth is positive, the company's profitability needs substantial improvement.  Short-term indicators suggest caution, while long-term potential is highly dependent on the company's ability to achieve sustained profitability and market share growth in a competitive space industry.  Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance before investing in RKLB.  Further due diligence, including a comprehensive analysis of the company's future growth prospects and competitive landscape, is strongly recommended.
