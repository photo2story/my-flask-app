## Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) Stock Analysis Report

**Executive Summary:** Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB), a provider of launch services and space systems, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showcasing a remarkably high cumulative return.  However, recent financial data reveals consistent losses, despite increasing revenue.  The stock's valuation requires careful consideration of its high growth potential against its current profitability.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

Rocket Lab's cumulative return (335.49%) vastly surpasses that of the S&P 500 (65.92%).  The divergence is substantial (269.6 percentage points), placing it at the 85th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This suggests exceptional performance relative to the market but should be considered in the context of the high risk implied by the high beta values in the table below.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -52.0%   | 30.6%  | -47.0% | 0.0   | 1.7    |
| 2021-2023  | -18.0%   | 30.6%  | -42.0% | 0.0   | 2.5    |
| 2022-2024  | 328.0%   | 30.6%  | 295.0% | -0.0  | 11.4   |
| 2023-2025  | 370.0%   | 28.5%  | 308.0% | 0.0   | 12.6   |

The high and fluctuating beta values (0.0 to 12.6) indicate significant sensitivity to market movements. While recent periods show extremely high growth, earlier periods demonstrate substantial volatility and negative returns.  The alpha values are largely negative suggesting that the returns are not entirely explained by market movements and may include considerable risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $28.02
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $28.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $28.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $26.06

The stock price is currently trading slightly below its short-term moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. However, it sits above the 60-day moving average suggesting some underlying upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 43.47 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.99 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +1.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -12.9% (Negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term)

The mixed signals from the technical indicators suggest caution. While the recent relative strength suggests short-term upward pressure, the negative PPO and expected return suggest a potential for further downside.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date        | EPS      | Revenue       |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-11-12  | -0.1     | $0.10 B       |
| 2024-08-08  | -0.08    | $0.11 B       |
| 2024-05-06  | -0.09    | $0.09 B       |
| 2023-11-08  | -0.08    | $0.07 B       |
| 2024-11-12  | -0.08    | $0.07 B       |

Revenue is showing a slight upward trend, while the company continues to report negative EPS.  This indicates that, while the company may be gaining traction, profitability remains elusive. The duplicated date (2024-11-12) suggests a possible data entry error.  Clarification is needed.

**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided, limiting a comprehensive financial analysis.  Further financial data is crucial for a thorough assessment of the company's financial health.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

RKLB's exceptional past performance relative to the S&P 500 is undeniable. However, the currently negative EPS, the lack of comprehensive financial data, the mixed technical indicators, and the high beta all point towards significant risk.  The high growth potential must be carefully weighed against the current lack of profitability and market volatility.   A long-term investment strategy requires a thorough understanding of the company's future prospects, including its path to profitability and its ability to maintain its current growth trajectory. Further investigation into financial data and a detailed assessment of the companyâ€™s competitive landscape are needed before making any investment decision.
