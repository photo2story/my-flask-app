## Rocket Lab USA Inc (RKLB) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Rocket Lab USA Inc. is a space launch and satellite manufacturing company.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO),  with substantially higher cumulative returns. However, this needs further investigation considering the high volatility and beta.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison:**

* **RKLB Cumulative Return:** 330.20%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 64.71%
* **Return Difference:** 265.5% (This is the current difference,  not necessarily sustainable.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 84.0% (Indicates RKLB's performance is in the top 84th percentile of its historical performance relative to VOO.  It doesn't imply 84% better, but rather its position within its historical range of divergence.)

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility (high Beta) and significant swings in performance across different periods.  While the most recent period shows extraordinarily high CAGR, the earlier periods show substantial negative returns.  This highlights significant risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $27.68
* **Last Market Price:** $28.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $28.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $27.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $24.86

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average and significantly above the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The recent price increase is small, not indicating a "sharp rebound."

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.92 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -1.04 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.7% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -13.4% (This suggests an expected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term â€“ a significant risk factor.)

The recent price change (1.28%) is minor and doesn't significantly affect the overall analysis.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.10 | $0.10B       |
| 2024-08-08 | -$0.08 | $0.11B       |
| 2024-05-06 | -$0.09 | $0.09B       |
| 2023-11-08 | -$0.08 | $0.07B       |
| 2024-11-12 | -$0.08 | $0.07B       | *(Likely a duplicate entry)*


The company consistently reports negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  Revenue is growing, but not fast enough to offset losses.  The duplicate entry in the table needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $0.10B   | 26.71%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.11B   | 25.56%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.09B   | 26.06%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.06B   | 25.82%        |
| 2023-09-30  | $0.07B   | 22.12%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE       |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-09-30  | $0.42B   | -12.37%   |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.46B   | -9.15%    |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.48B   | -9.24%    |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.55B   | -9.11%    |
| 2023-09-30  | $0.59B   | -6.93%    |

Revenue shows a slight upward trend, while profit margins are relatively stable. However, the negative ROE consistently indicates that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  This is a significant concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RKLB has shown exceptional returns compared to the S&P 500, but this is driven by high volatility and a high Beta, indicating significant risk.  The company is currently unprofitable, despite growing revenue, and the negative ROE is a major red flag. While the short-term price action might be positive, the long-term outlook remains uncertain due to the persistent losses and negative expected return compared to the S&P 500.  Investors should proceed with caution, considering the high risk involved.  Further investigation into the company's future prospects, including its revenue growth potential and cost-cutting strategies, is necessary before making any investment decisions.
