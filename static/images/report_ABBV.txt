**7.  Comprehensive Analysis:**

ABBV has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, although recent short-term price action indicates a bearish trend. Positive financial results (EPS consistently exceeding expectations) and a relatively high expected return suggest potential long-term value. However, technical indicators (RSI, PPO) point to a potentially oversold situation.  A comprehensive evaluation requires analysis of recent news and analyst sentiment.  The observed fluctuation in ROE and profit margin warrants further investigation into the underlying business dynamics.
