## AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) Stock Review

This report analyzes AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), a research-based biopharmaceutical company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

AbbVie's cumulative return of 147.25% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's return of 125.6%.  The difference is 21.65%, placing it at the 40.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. While the outperformance is notable, the relative percentile suggests periods of underperformance compared to the index.  The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating outperformance, ranging from underperforming to significantly outperforming the market in different periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $166.57
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $167.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $187.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $190.77

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a bearish trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (11.4):**  Significantly below 30, suggesting the stock is oversold. This could indicate potential for a rebound, but it also carries risk.
* **PPO (-1.86):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-27.95):** Shows a recent significant decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (24.02%):**  This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500, assuming a consistent investment strategy. The 166.58 closing price, being below moving averages and with negative indicators, doesn't indicate immediate 급반등 (sharp rebound), rather a potential for one after a period of consolidation based on the oversold condition (RSI).

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The company's EPS has consistently exceeded expectations.  However, a slight downward trend in recent quarters might warrant further investigation.  The most recent quarter (2024-10-30) shows a slight miss on expectations (3 vs 2.92). While still positive and exceeding expectations for several quarters prior, this slight downward trend requires attention to understand the underlying reasons.

**5.  Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue has shown some fluctuations but remains strong. Profit margins have generally been high, although a decline is noticeable towards the end of 2023 and early 2024. The decline in margin is something to monitor for future trends.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  ROE shows fluctuations, indicating varying efficiency in using shareholder's equity to generate profit.  A decline in ROE in late 2023 and early 2024 correlates with the decline in profit margins.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires access to real-time news sources such as Shacknews, Finbold, etc., to provide current information on earnings announcements, analyst opinions, and market outlook.  Please provide relevant news articles for a complete analysis.)*  Specific news from the past 48 hours regarding earnings announcements, analyst ratings upgrades/downgrades, etc., needs to be incorporated here.

**7. Summary:**

AbbVie has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, but its recent performance has weakened. While the RSI suggests it's oversold and the long-term outlook remains positive according to the expected return, several indicators (negative PPO, price below moving averages, declining ROE and profit margins) signal a bearish short-to-medium term trend.  Further analysis is needed based on recent news and a deeper dive into the reasons behind the decline in profitability to ascertain the strength of the long-term prospects. The slight miss on EPS expectations in the most recent quarter warrants further investigation.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current market position and indicators, a cautious approach is recommended. The oversold condition (RSI) presents a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors, but investors should closely monitor the upcoming earnings reports, news, and analyst sentiment before making any significant investment decisions.  A deep dive into the reasons behind the recent decline in profit margins and ROE is crucial to understand the long-term growth story.  Monitoring the price action relative to the moving averages will provide insight into near-term trends.
