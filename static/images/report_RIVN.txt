## Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) is an American electric vehicle maker.  As of the last data point, RIVN's cumulative return is -28.62%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 22.95%.  This represents a divergence of -51.6%.  The relative divergence of -27.7% indicates that RIVN's performance is significantly below the S&P 500, falling within the lower quartile of its historical performance range relative to the index.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance metrics across different time periods.  While the CAGR is projected to increase over time, the negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market. The high beta (14-24) indicates high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) consistently remains high (31.7%-36.7%), highlighting significant risk.  These factors imply that despite potential future growth, RIVN is a high-risk investment.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 12.0% | 0.0 | 24.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -18.0% | 0.0 | 14.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 23.0% | 31.7% | -30.0% | 0.0 | 14.0 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.85
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $15.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $14.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.00

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The 5-day MA being significantly higher than the 20 and 60-day MAs indicates recent volatility and a possible short-term bounce.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.03  (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.65 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +4.5 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -47.5% (Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is projected over the long term)

The current price of $13.85, while below recent averages, does not signal an extreme event (e.g., a sharp drop). The negative expected return, however, highlights the significant risk associated with long-term investment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals consistent losses (negative EPS) and relatively stable revenues. While revenue is increasing slightly, the company is not yet profitable.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of revenue growth and the path to profitability.  Note the duplicate entry for 2024-11-07 in the provided data.

**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability show inconsistent trends. Profit margins remain consistently negative, indicating ongoing operational challenges. Equity has been decreasing, and the return on equity (ROE) is also negative, reflecting the company's current financial struggles.  This suggests significant financial risk.

**7. Overall Summary:**

Rivian Automotive shows significant potential but faces substantial challenges.  While the company is working to ramp up production and expand its market reach, its current financial performance and high volatility present considerable risk.  The negative expected return and consistently negative profit margins suggest a long road to profitability.  Investors should proceed with caution and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in RIVN.  Further due diligence, including an in-depth analysis of the company's long-term strategy and competitive landscape, is strongly recommended.
