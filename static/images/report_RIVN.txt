* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $14.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.32

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some recent upward momentum. However, it remains below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.99 -  Close to neutral territory, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** -0.95 - Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -4.3% - Short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -60.6% - This significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests a substantial underperformance is projected over the long term.

The fact the current price is relatively close to the moving averages implies there is potential for both upward and downward movement.  However, given the negative expected return, any such upward movement may be temporary.
