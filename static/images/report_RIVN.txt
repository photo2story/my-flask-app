## Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) is an American electric vehicle (EV) maker.  Since its IPO, RIVN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last data point, RIVN shows a cumulative return of -57.72%, while the VOO has a cumulative return of 28.95%. This represents a substantial difference of -86.67%, placing it at the 3.07 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max range).  The provided CAGR figures (-76.7% and -90.2%) further highlight the significant underperformance.  High Beta values (2.3 and 2.2) indicate substantial price volatility compared to the overall market.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values (66.4% and 62.3%) showcase considerable risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $10.07 (Last Market: $10.08)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $10.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $10.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $11.48

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.13 (Slightly below neutral; not overtly oversold or overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.4 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but relatively weak)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 2.75 (+), suggesting short-term upward momentum.

The slightly positive PPO and positive relative divergence suggest some potential for upward movement, but the RSI is not strongly indicative of an imminent trend reversal.  Given the current price of $10.08 is not significantly different from the closing price, there is no evidence of a sharp price movement (either up or down). The expected return is 0.0%, meaning no significant alpha is predicted over the long term against the S&P 500.  Long-term (2+ years) accumulative investment is unlikely to yield significant outperformance against the S&P 500 based on current data.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows consistent negative EPS and a generally declining trend in revenue (although there's some fluctuation).  The most recent earnings report (2024-11-07) shows an EPS of -1.08 and revenue of $0.87B.  Crucially, the provided data lacks analyst estimates for comparison, hindering a full assessment of the most recent earnings' success or failure against expectations.  More data is needed to make a decisive comment on the overall financial outlook.


**5. Financial Information Analysis (Revenue & Profitability, Capital & Profitability):**

Both the Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability data consistently show negative profits and declining Return on Equity (ROE) over the past year. This indicates significant financial challenges for Rivian.  The negative profit margins highlight the company's struggles with profitability despite relatively high revenues. The consistently declining ROE suggests problems with capital efficiency and utilization.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Rivian is currently facing significant headwinds.  The company's stock has severely underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility and substantial losses.  Financial performance shows consistent losses despite relatively high revenue.  Technical indicators offer mixed signals, with some hinting at potential short-term upward movement, but overall are not strongly bullish.  A comprehensive analysis requires a more in-depth look at the recent news and analyst sentiment to fully assess the short-term and long-term prospects of the stock. The significant negative alpha and high beta further highlight the risk involved. Long-term investors should carefully weigh the risks against the potential for future growth in the EV market.


**8. Recommendations:**

Based on the currently available information,  RIVN presents a high-risk investment. While the long-term potential for the EV market remains, Rivian's current financial state and market performance are concerning. More detailed research into recent news, analyst opinions, and a comparison of recent earnings against expectations is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A thorough risk assessment is essential before considering any investment in RIVN.
