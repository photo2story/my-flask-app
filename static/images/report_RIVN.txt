## Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) Stock Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) is an American electric vehicle maker.  The cumulative return of RIVN is -34.18%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 32.91%.  This represents a significant divergence of **-67.1%**, placing it in the 12.2nd percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max).

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant variability, ranging from 8% to 18% depending on the period considered, however these figures need to be interpreted in the context of the negative overall performance and substantial MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  The alpha consistently being near zero indicates the stockâ€™s performance closely tracks the market (beta values indicate a high sensitivity to market movements), although this varies slightly year to year.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.77
* **5-day Moving Average:** $13.09
* **20-day Moving Average:** $13.88
* **60-day Moving Average:** $12.48

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price increase (2.24% from the previous close) is relatively small compared to the moving averages, and should be viewed within the context of the overall downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 47.53  (Near the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -2.01 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -14.5% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -138.7% (This represents a projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. This is a significant negative projection and requires further scrutiny.)

The recent price increase of 2.24% is not substantial enough to suggest a significant reversal from the broader negative trend.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian's performance is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500, exhibiting consistent losses and negative profitability. Technical indicators point towards a bearish short-term trend, and the projected long-term return is dramatically negative. While revenue has shown some fluctuation, the company's fundamental financial health is severely challenged, and the considerable negative expected return relative to the market requires further investigation and confirmation.  The high beta suggests substantial market sensitivity which magnifies both gains and losses.  This is a high-risk investment.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution.  Additional due diligence is strongly recommended before any investment decision.
