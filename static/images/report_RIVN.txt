### 7. 종합 Conclusion

Rivian is a high-risk, high-potential stock. It has significantly underperformed the market. The analyst consensus is "Hold." The news is mixed with negative sales forecast and analyst comparisons with Tesla. While recent earnings show revenue growth, profitability remains a major concern.  The extremely negative expected return suggests substantial risk. The "Buy" signal generated by the Hybrid Signal might be a short-term indicator and needs to be cautiously interpreted in light of the long-term risks.

**Overall Recommendation:**  Given the negative expected return, high volatility, ongoing losses, and mixed news, a cautious approach is warranted. It is not advisable unless the investor has a high risk tolerance and is willing to withstand substantial potential losses. A potential short-term buying opportunity may exist due to the oversold RSI, but it's crucial to carefully manage the risk associated with this investment. The analysis indicates that investing in RIVN is considered a higher risk compared to investing in VOO.
