**7. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian Automotive is currently showing significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Negative earnings, low RSI, and bearish PPO indicators all contribute to a negative outlook.  The exceptionally high negative projected long-term return (-172.5%) is highly unlikely and requires a critical review of the methodology used to arrive at this figure.  While the recent price increase is noteworthy, the overall financial health of the company, highlighted by persistent losses and declining equity, raises serious concerns.  A thorough examination of the companyâ€™s strategic initiatives and market positioning is crucial to determine its future prospects.  Investing in RIVN should be approached with extreme caution given the current data.
