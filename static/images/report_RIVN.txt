**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500, exhibiting consistent losses and negative profitability. While some short-term positive indicators are present (20-day relative strength), the long-term outlook appears uncertain.  The high Beta signifies considerable market risk.  The lack of strong revenue growth coupled with persistent losses raises serious concerns about its long-term viability.  A thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The absence of positive expected returns further underscores the cautionary signal.  The current situation calls for a careful assessment of future prospects, particularly concerning the company's ability to achieve profitability and sustainable growth.

**8. Recommendations:**

Based on the current analysis, RIVN presents significant risk. Further research is needed, focusing on:

* **Detailed analysis of the most recent earnings report:** Comparing actual results to analyst expectations to better understand the market's reaction.
* **Review of recent news and analyst opinions:** To assess any changes in market sentiment or outlook.
* **Assessment of the company's long-term growth strategy:** To determine its potential for future profitability.

Without more optimistic future indicators, a cautious approach to investing in RIVN is recommended.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and potentially seek diversified investment strategies.
