## Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) Stock Review

This report analyzes Rivian Automotive Inc., an electric vehicle maker, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Rivian (RIVN) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for RIVN is -32.93%, while VOO shows a 3.24% return. This represents a substantial divergence of -36.2%, placing it at the 47.5th percentile of the historical range of divergence (max: 3.1%, min: -71.8%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -2.0% | 76.0% | -16.0% | 0.0 | 26.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 20.0% | 76.0% | -4.0% | 0.0 | 15.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 20.0% | 76.0% | -17.0% | -0.1 | 12.8 |

While CAGR shows improvement from negative to positive, the consistently negative Alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market, even with a relatively low beta.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant price volatility and risk.  The decreasing market capitalization further reflects the company's struggles.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $11.21
* **Last Market Price:** $11.31 (0.85% increase from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $11.94
* **20-day Moving Average:** $11.68
* **60-day Moving Average:** $12.34

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-to-medium-term trend.  The recent slight increase needs further observation to determine if it's a sustained upward trend or a temporary fluctuation.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 50.07 (Neutral)
* **PPO:** -0.24 (Bearish)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.3 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -39.8% (Significant negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term).

The high MRI, negative PPO, and significantly negative expected return paint a cautious outlook. While the short-term upward momentum is noticeable, the overall technical picture leans bearish.  The recent price increase of 0.85% is a small positive movement but insufficient to offset the broader negative trends.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian Automotive Inc. currently presents a high-risk investment.  The stock has severely underperformed the market, showing consistent losses and negative profitability despite recent improvements in revenue and profit margin in the most recent quarter. The high maximum drawdown and negative expected return highlight the significant volatility and potential for further losses.  While short-term price movements might offer occasional opportunities, the long-term outlook remains uncertain.  Investors should proceed with caution and consider the substantial risks involved. Further analysis of future earnings and strategic developments is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests a long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500, making it a risky proposition for long-term investors unless a significant turnaround occurs.
