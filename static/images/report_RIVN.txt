| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $1.56B    | 1.54%         |
| 2025-06-30 | $1.30B    | -15.81%        |

*Analysis:* The inconsistent profit margins and negative ROE (Return on Equity) further emphasize the company's struggle to achieve profitability. While revenue is growing in some periods, the company's ability to efficiently convert revenue into profits is still a challenge. The fluctuating equity suggests changes in the company's capital structure.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Rivian is a high-growth, high-risk stock.** Its performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500.
*   **Profitability is a major concern.**  The company is consistently losing money, and while revenue is growing, profit margins are volatile and often negative.
*   **Analyst opinions are mixed,** reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Rivian's future.
*   **The recent stock price decline and negative expected return are warning signs.**
*   **News flow is mixed, with both positive catalysts and negative headwinds.**
*   **The MRI indicates high investment suitability, yet many other indicators suggest caution.**

**In conclusion:** Rivian presents a speculative investment opportunity. While there are potential upside catalysts (like new models or a short squeeze), the company's lack of profitability and the mixed analyst sentiment suggest a cautious approach. The high MDD and negative expected return indicate significant risk. Investors should carefully weigh the potential rewards against the substantial risks before investing in Rivian.
