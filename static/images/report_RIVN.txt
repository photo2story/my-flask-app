Okay, here's a breakdown of the Rivian (RIVN) analysis based on the provided data.

**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** RIVN (Rivian Automotive Inc) - An electric vehicle manufacturer focusing on trucks and SUVs.
*   **RIVN Cumulative Return:** 23.25%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 37.99%
*   **Divergence:** -14.7% (Relative Divergence: 49.6%)

**Analysis:** Rivian has underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. The divergence of -14.7% indicates that Rivian's returns are significantly lower than the market benchmark.  The relative divergence of 49.6% suggests the current divergence is near the middle of its historical range, indicating the degree of underperformance has been fairly typical in the observed timeframe.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | 23.0%  | 80.4% | -18.0% | 0.1  | 24.3   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** A high 23.0% CAGR suggests strong potential growth, but this is tempered by other factors.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The very high 80.4% MDD indicates a significant level of risk and volatility. Investors could experience substantial losses.
*   **Alpha:** The negative Alpha (-18.0%) reinforces the underperformance relative to the market (as seen in the simple return comparison). It signifies that Rivian has generated returns below what would be expected given its beta.
*   **Beta:** A low Beta of 0.1 suggests the stock is not very correlated with the overall market.  It's less sensitive to market movements than the average stock.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap in Billions. Rivian is considered a mid-cap stock.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **5-day SMA:** \$20.694
*   **20-day SMA:** \$19.0313
*   **60-day SMA:** \$15.9654

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is below the 5-day SMA, but above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a recent downward trend in the short term, but an overall upward trend when looking at longer time horizons.
*   The slight price increase at the last market close indicates a very modest rebound, but not necessarily a change in the downward trend.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI:** 57.64 (Neutral)

*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -16.7 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -17.7% (Long-term Underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, implying a moderate level of risk.
*   The RSI is around 57, indicating neutral momentum, neither overbought nor oversold.
*   The PPO is slightly negative, suggesting a bearish trend, but the value is small.
*   The Hybrid Signal is to buy with all available cash, signaling a strong buy recommendation due to the safety of the MRI.
*   The negative change in relative divergence reinforces the short-term downward trend.
*   The expected return of -17.7% suggests that Rivian is projected to underperform the S&P 500 significantly over the long term if these trends persist.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in Rivian is speculative.  The company shows revenue growth potential, and it has a reasonable MRI of 0.9 (Medium Investment). However, the lack of profitability, underperformance relative to the market, the news headlines, and analyst uncertainty warrant caution.  Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon before investing in RIVN. The strong buy signal provided by the Hybrid Signal is the sole signal pointing at a long-term investment.
