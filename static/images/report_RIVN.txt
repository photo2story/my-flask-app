2025-01-14 - Analysis Report
Here's a report summarizing the provided data on Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN).

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) is an American electric vehicle maker.  The cumulative return of RIVN is -30.48%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 23.22%. The difference is a substantial -53.7%, placing it at the 25.6th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-79.3% to 20.8%).  This indicates consistent underperformance against the benchmark index.  The provided CAGR figures show positive growth, but this is likely skewed by the initial IPO pricing and subsequent significant drop.  The Alpha consistently near zero suggests the stockâ€™s performance is largely explained by the market's movement (Beta is significantly high).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.49
* **5-day Moving Average:** $14.44
* **20-day Moving Average:** $14.14
* **60-day Moving Average:** $12.06

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5 and 20-day moving averages may suggest a potential slowing of the downward momentum, but more data would be needed to confirm this.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.62 (Slightly above neutral; not significantly overbought or oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.13 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Strength Divergence:** -11.6% (Indicates a recent weakening of the stock's relative strength.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -53.1% (This represents a significant projected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, given current trends.)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum.  The negative expected return, coupled with the already substantial underperformance against the S&P 500, paints a concerning picture for long-term investors.  The price of $13.49 is close to the 60-day average, suggesting it is not in a dramatic uptrend or downtrend, but a consolidation period instead.  Further evaluation is needed to gauge any sudden price fluctuations.
