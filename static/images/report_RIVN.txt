**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $1.56B    | 1.54%          |
| 2025-06-30 | $1.30B    | -15.81%        |

| 2024-09-30 | $0.87B    | -44.85%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE      |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| 2025-09-30 | $5.07B    | -23.15%  |
| 2025-06-30 | $6.07B    | -18.41%  |

| 2024-09-30 | $5.90B    | -18.65%  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue & Profit Margin:**  While revenue has generally been increasing, profit margins are volatile and often negative. The recent positive profit margin in 2025-09-30 is a welcome sign, but the inconsistency is concerning.
*   **Equity & ROE:** Equity has fluctuated and recently decreased, which is not a positive trend. The consistently negative ROE (Return on Equity) indicates the company is not generating profits from shareholders' investments.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Rivian (RIVN) presents a mixed investment picture. On one hand, the company shows promise with strong recent growth, increasing revenue, and active engagement in lobbying. The hybrid signal suggests a strong buy with monthly investments, indicating confidence in the stock's potential. The potential of the upcoming R2 model as a cheaper option for consumers also offers a glimmer of hope.

However, significant concerns remain. RIVN has underperformed the S&P 500 substantially. The recent negative change in relative divergence, negative EPS, volatile profit margins, negative ROE, analyst consensus of "Hold" with a low average target price, and the negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 all point to considerable risks. Recent equity decrease is also concerning.

**Overall Recommendation:** Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is warranted. The high growth potential is undeniable, but the financial challenges and market uncertainties make RIVN a risky investment at this time. Investors should closely monitor key metrics such as deliveries, profit margins, and the success of the R2 model before making any investment decisions.
