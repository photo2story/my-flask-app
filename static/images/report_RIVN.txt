The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) data show inconsistent performance.  While CAGR is positive, it's low considering the high MDD.  The Alpha of 0 suggests the stock hasn't outperformed the market after accounting for risk (Beta), while the high Beta (significantly above 1) highlights its volatility.  The substantial decrease in market capitalization further supports underperformance.
