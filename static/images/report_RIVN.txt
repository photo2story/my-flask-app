Both Revenue and Profitability are showing a negative trend. While revenue shows a decrease quarter over quarter in recent periods, profit margin remains largely negative, indicating significant losses.  Equity has declined notably, and ROE consistently shows negative returns on equity.  This suggests the company is not yet generating profits and faces challenges in its financial health.

No specific news or analyst opinions are provided within the given data.  Information on recent market outlook is also absent.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian is currently experiencing significant challenges.  While the short-term technical indicators show some potential for a bounce, the underlying fundamentals – consistent net losses, declining revenue, negative ROE, and substantial underperformance against the S&P 500 – paint a concerning picture. The 0% expected return suggests that long-term investment needs to be carefully considered, given the high risk associated with the company's current financial situation. Further investigation into the reasons behind the company's financial losses and future growth strategies is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The absence of recent news and analyst opinions further limits the analysis.
