**Analysis of Provided Table:**

The table provides a snapshot of Rivian's performance metrics over different periods compared to the S&P 500 (VOO). Let's break down each column:

*   **Year:** The period for which the data is calculated. It's presented in rolling windows (e.g., 2021-2023, 2022-2024, 2023-2025).
*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The average annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time, assuming profits are reinvested during the term.
    *   The CAGR values range from -2.0% to 25.0%, indicating fluctuating performance over the different periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, before a new peak is attained. It measures the worst possible loss during a specified period.
    *   MDD is consistently high at 76.0% across all periods, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** A measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis. It represents the excess return of an investment relative to a benchmark index.
    *   The Alpha values are negative, ranging from -1.0% to -21.0%, indicating underperformance compared to the benchmark (likely the S&P 500).
*   **Beta:** A measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock's price will move with the market. A beta greater than 1 indicates that the stock's price will be more volatile than the market.

**Overall Summary:**

Rivian's performance shows some recovery in CAGR over recent periods, but it's still accompanied by high volatility (MDD) and negative Alpha. This suggests that while returns have improved, they haven't been enough to outperform the market benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis. The Beta values indicate varying correlations with the market, with the beta decreasing over time. The decreasing market capitalization is a concerning trend, reflecting investor sentiment.
