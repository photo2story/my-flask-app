The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest a bearish bias, despite the short-term upward movement.  The significantly negative expected return highlights the substantial risk associated with long-term investment in RIVN compared to the S&P 500.  The market price of $14.51 is not significantly different from the closing price, therefore there is no indication of a sharp price movement (upward or downward).

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian is currently facing significant challenges.

While short-term price movements may suggest some upward momentum, the long-term outlook is bearish, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 based on both historical and projected returns.  The data suggests a high level of risk associated with investing in RIVN.  Further investigation into the causes of the persistent losses and plans for profitability is crucial before considering any investment.
