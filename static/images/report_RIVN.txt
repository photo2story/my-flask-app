The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance and high risk:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                  |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|------------------------------------------|
| 2021-2023  | -2.0% | 76.0% | -16.0% | 0.0 | 25.6 | High risk, negative alpha, significant MDD |
| 2022-2024  | 20.0% | 76.0% | -4.0% | 0.0 | 14.5 | Still high risk, negative alpha             |
| 2023-2025  | 17.0% | 99.9% | -0.1 | 12.9 | Slightly improved, but very high MDD        |


The high maximum drawdown (MDD) across all periods highlights the significant risk associated with investing in RIVN.  The negative alpha consistently indicates underperformance relative to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The significant drop in the last market price indicates a potentially rapid downward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4271 (Low Risk) â€“ This suggests low overall market risk, although this is a general market indicator and not specific to RIVN.

* **Expected Return:** -55.1% (This is a very negative outlook and needs further justification in the context of long term investment).

The sharp price drop of -3.27% reflects the recent market sentiment about Rivian. While the MRI indicates low overall market risk, the negative PPO and recent divergence signal a downward trend for RIVN specifically. The extremely negative expected return suggests significant downside risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian Automotive is currently experiencing significant challenges.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, showing consistent negative alpha and high risk.  While recent revenue figures show some improvement, the company is still unprofitable and faces high volatility. The negative expected return, combined with the negative PPO and bearish price trends, indicates a high risk investment.  A long-term investment strategy should carefully consider the high risk of significant losses.  More detailed fundamental analysis (including competitive landscape and future production projections) and a thorough risk assessment are necessary before any investment decision.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entries) raise concerns about the reliability of the provided data.
