## Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) Stock Report

**0) Overview:** Rivian Automotive Inc is an American electric vehicle maker.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Rivian (RIVN) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for RIVN is -40.7%, while VOO shows a 19.4% return. This results in a substantial gap of -60.1%, placing it at the 19.2 percentile of its historical range relative to VOO (using the provided min/max range).


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance metrics.  While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows positive growth for all periods, Alpha is consistently near zero, indicating the stock's performance is largely explained by the market (Beta is significantly high indicating high volatility).  However, the negative Alpha in 2023-2025 suggests underperformance relative to the market.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) indicates substantial periods of significant price declines.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 12.0% | 0.0 | 26.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -18.0% | 0.0 | 15.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 11.0% | 31.7% | -38.0% | -0.0 | 12.6 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $11.17
* **5-day Moving Average:** $11.28
* **20-day Moving Average:** $12.37
* **60-day Moving Average:** $13.23

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent 1.27% increase from the previous close might be a temporary bounce within this downtrend.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (22.29):**  Indicates oversold conditions, potentially suggesting a bounce, but not necessarily a sustained uptrend.
* **PPO (-1.19):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent increase in relative strength (5.0) points to a short-term price recovery, as consistent with the slight upward change.
* **Expected Return (-84.6%):**  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) highlights the significant risk involved in investing in RIVN at the current juncture.  Itâ€™s crucial to consider the high degree of uncertainty associated with this prediction.
* **Last Market Change:** The 1.27% increase reflects a minor price rebound, but it's insufficient to reverse the overall downward trend.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently reported negative EPS (earnings per share) over the past few quarters, though there seems to be a slight improvement or at least flattening of the EPS values in the most recent quarter, alongside the increasing revenues.  Revenue is increasing, but not at a pace that offsets the significant losses. Note there is duplicate data for 2024-11-07.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|

| 2024-11-07 | -1.44 | $1.34 B     |


**5) Financial Information:**

The financial data shows inconsistent profitability. While revenue is generally increasing, profit margins remain deeply negative.  Equity has fluctuated, and Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns for its shareholders.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Rivian is currently facing significant challenges. While revenue is growing, the company is consistently unprofitable, with deeply negative profit margins and ROE. The stock price reflects this poor performance, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, hinting at a potential short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook remains highly uncertain and risky, as indicated by the strongly negative projected return relative to the market.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering any investment in RIVN.  The high beta also suggests significant volatility.
