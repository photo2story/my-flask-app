**0. Key Figures Overview:**

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **RIVN Cumulative Return:** -35.27%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 30.66%
* **Return Difference:** -65.9%  (This represents the current cumulative return difference between RIVN and VOO.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 12.0% | 0.0 | 23.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -18.0% | 0.0 | 13.5 |
| 2023-2025  | 17.0% | 31.7% | -44.0% | 0.0 | 12.8 |

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows inconsistent performance, while the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) reveals significant volatility.  Alpha consistently being 0.0 is suspicious, and warrants further investigation into the methodology used.  Beta near zero may not be accurate based on the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.56
* **Last Market Price:** $12.52 (a slight decrease of -$0.36 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.66

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 35.63 (Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, but this does not guarantee an upward trend)
* **PPO:** -1.42 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** 1.2 (+) (Short-term upward trend in relative divergence)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -125.4% (This significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests significant risk and underperformance in a long-term investment.)

The recent price drop is likely contributing to the oversold conditions and bearish sentiment. The extremely negative expected return underscores substantial risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08  | $0.87B      |
| 2024-08-06 | -$1.46  | $1.16B      |

| 2024-11-07 | -$1.44  | $1.34B      | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*

Rivian continues to report significant losses, although there is some suggestion of revenue growth from Q4 2023 until Q2 2024, followed by a drop in Q3 2024.  The repeated entry for 2024-11-07 needs clarification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian is currently experiencing substantial financial challenges, reflected in consistent losses, negative profit margins, and significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While the stock shows signs of being oversold, the fundamental weaknesses and negative long-term outlook present significant risk.  The accuracy of some provided data (Alpha, Beta, duplicate earnings entry) should be verified.  Before investing, thorough due diligence and consideration of the significant risks involved are crucial.  The -125.4% expected return strongly suggests this stock is not a suitable candidate for long-term, S&P 500-relative outperformance.
