**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian Automotive (RIVN) shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, reflected in its negative cumulative return and consistently negative alpha.  Negative EPS, profit margins, and ROE highlight fundamental weaknesses.  Technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, although the RSI is approaching oversold levels.  The extremely negative projected long-term return emphasizes the substantial risk involved.  The presence of duplicate data entries needs to be resolved for accurate analysis.  Further investigation into the company's operational efficiency and future projections is crucial before considering any investment.  The current situation suggests a high-risk investment with significant potential for further losses.
