Rivian Automotive Inc. is an American electric vehicle (EV) maker.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance of RIVN compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return difference of -65.9% highlights this substantial lag.  The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows a consistently low alpha (near zero), indicating it hasn't outperformed the market significantly.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 12.0% | 0.0 | 23.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -18.0% | 0.0 | 13.6 |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.66

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price increase of $0.399683610045559 (from $12.51)  is minor and doesn't significantly alter the overall bearish trend indicated by the moving averages.

* **RSI:** 35.63 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -1.42 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)

* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -125.4% (Significant underperformance against S&P 500 expected over the long term, based on this data.)

The conflicting signals from the moving averages (downward trend) and the short-term relative divergence (+1.2, short-term upward movement) need further investigation. The extremely negative expected return suggests significant risk associated with long-term investment.
