The stock price is currently above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. However,  the relatively high RSI (see below) suggests it may be overbought. The difference between the last market price (12.35) and the closing price (12.34) is negligible.

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 77.81  - Indicates the stock is in overbought territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 1.67 - Suggests positive momentum but should be interpreted in conjunction with other indicators.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** nan (-) - Shows a recent short-term decline in relative strength.  The "nan" value suggests a missing data point or a calculation error.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% - The provided expected return is zero, indicating no anticipated excess return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment with consistent contributions. This is likely a conservative estimate given the historical underperformance.

The provided earnings data shows consistent negative EPS and declining revenue, though there are some fluctuations.

* **Revenue:** Revenue has generally declined over the past few quarters, except for a slight uptick in Q2 2024.
* **EPS:** EPS has remained consistently negative throughout the reported period.
* **Trends:**  There is no clear trend beyond consistent losses. There are no specific figures to compare to expectations, so "beats" or "misses" cannot be assessed.  There's a duplicate entry for 2024-11-07. This needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reinforces the picture of significant losses.  Profit margins are deeply negative, suggesting the company is not yet profitable.  Equity has been declining, alongside a negative return on equity (ROE). While revenue was higher in earlier quarters, it has decreased recently.  The negative ROE and profit margins indicate considerable financial challenges.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last 2 days) or market outlook information was provided.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian is currently facing significant challenges.  While the recent price movement shows some positive momentum, the underlying financial performance is weak. Consistent negative EPS and decreasing revenue, alongside a low RSI and a substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, paint a concerning picture.  The overbought RSI suggests caution.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more comprehensive assessment of current market sentiment and potential catalysts for future performance.  Further investigation is needed to determine if the recent price increase is sustainable.  The provided expected return of 0%  is likely too cautious given the historical underperformance.  More data, specifically expectations and analyst reviews, is needed for a more robust analysis.  The company's ability to improve its profitability and manage its financial situation will be crucial for future success.
