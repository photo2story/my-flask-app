**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures show fluctuating performance and negative alpha, indicating underperformance relative to a benchmark index.  The high Beta values suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The negative alpha across all periods further underscores underperformance compared to the benchmark.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 12.0% | 0.0 | 23.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -18.0% | 0.0 | 13.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.30
* **5-day Moving Average:** $12.74
* **20-day Moving Average:** $12.87
* **60-day Moving Average:** $12.99

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, the relatively small difference between the current price and the moving averages indicates limited momentum. The recent price change of 6.57% shows a significant jump from the previous day's closing price.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.22 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.23 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 1.4 (+), indicating a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -101.4%  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a significant concern and suggests substantial risk.  This is a highly pessimistic outlook and should be interpreted cautiously, as long-term forecasts are inherently uncertain. The recent price jump (6.57%) reflects a short-term positive change and does not necessarily invalidate the long-term negative expectation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company is reporting significant losses. Revenue is relatively stable, but consistently negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) indicates persistent unprofitability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian Automotive (RIVN) shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, marked by consistent negative EPS, negative profit margins, and a dramatically negative projected long-term return relative to the market. While recent short-term price action shows a positive uptick, the underlying fundamentals paint a concerning picture of persistent losses and declining equity.  The high Beta suggests substantial volatility.  Investors should carefully consider the considerable risks before investing in RIVN, especially given the projected long-term underperformance.  Further due diligence and a thorough understanding of the company's long-term strategic plan and its ability to achieve profitability are crucial.  The negative long-term expected return should be taken seriously.
