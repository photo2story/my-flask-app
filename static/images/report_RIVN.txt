| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -2.0% | 76.0% | -17.0% | 0.0 | 26.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 20.0% | 76.0% | -6.0% | 0.0 | 15.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.30
* **5-day Moving Average:** $12.60
* **20-day Moving Average:** $11.89
* **60-day Moving Average:** $12.01

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend, although the longer-term trend remains uncertain.  The recent 0.83% increase from the previous close indicates a small, positive jump, but doesn't qualify as a "sharp" increase.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 74.51 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 1.66 (Positive value indicates bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -64.3% (Significantly below S&P 500, indicating a high risk for long-term investment).  This strongly suggests that while short-term upward movement might happen, long-term investment in RIVN relative to VOO carries extremely high risk.  The company needs to significantly improve its fundamentals to justify long-term investment at current valuations.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent negative EPS, indicating losses across multiple quarters. Revenue has fluctuated, but a clear pattern of sustained profitability is absent.  The repeated entry of 2024-11-07 suggests a data entry error.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RIVN's performance has been significantly underwhelming compared to the S&P 500.  While short-term price movements show some upward momentum, the fundamental indicators (negative EPS, consistently negative profit margins, and negative ROE) paint a concerning picture. The high risk indicated by the expected return (-64.3%) strongly cautions against long-term investment unless significant improvements in profitability and financial health are demonstrated.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the company's financial struggles is crucial before considering any investment.  The data suggests a high level of risk and low potential for outperformance compared to the broader market.  The inconsistencies in the provided data (repeated dates) also raise concerns about data reliability.
