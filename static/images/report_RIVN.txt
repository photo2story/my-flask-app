**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian's stock performance has been significantly poor, drastically underperforming the S&P 500.

The -63% predicted long-term return relative to the S&P 500 underscores the substantial risk associated with this investment.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution and thoroughly research the company's future prospects and strategies before making any investment decisions.  The provided data is limited and further investigation is strongly recommended.
