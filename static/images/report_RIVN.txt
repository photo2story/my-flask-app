**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation. RSI indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold. The negative PPO and recent divergence change point to a potential short-term downward trend.  The negative expected return is a significant concern for long-term investors. The 'Hybrid Signal' suggests a buy signal with a high MRI, but this seems contradictory to the negative expected return.
