**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 12.0% | 0.0 | 26.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -18.0% | 0.0 | 15.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 20.0% | 31.7% | -40.0% | -0.0 | 14.8 |

The provided CAGR and Alpha values appear inconsistent and require clarification.  The negative Alpha values suggest underperformance relative to the benchmark, consistent with the overall return comparison. Beta values near zero suggest low correlation with the market. The decreasing market cap across the years is noteworthy.  These values require further investigation and context to offer a meaningful analysis.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.97
* **Previous Close:** $13.61
* **5-day Moving Average:** $13.796
* **20-day Moving Average:** $12.966
* **60-day Moving Average:** $13.2963

The price is currently trading slightly below its 20-day moving average, suggesting a potentially short-term bearish trend. The price is also below both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, reinforcing this bearish sentiment.  The recent price drop of approximately 4.7% from the previous close signals a possible short-term downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.64 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.75 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** +1.8 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, >2 years):** -89.8% (This is significantly negative and needs more context.  It’s unclear how this was calculated and requires clarification regarding the assumptions and methodology used).  This extraordinarily negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a serious red flag.

The substantial negative price change (-4.7%) from the previous close suggests a recent downward price movement, overriding the positive signs from the PPO and relative strength change.  The extremely negative expected return further reinforces concerns about future performance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|

| 2024-11-07 | -$1.44  | $1.34 B     | *(Duplicate entry – likely a data error)*

Rivian is consistently reporting negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  While revenue has fluctuated, there's no clear sign of significant revenue growth. The duplicated entry for November 2024 highlights potential data quality issues requiring further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian Automotive (RIVN) is currently facing significant challenges.  The stock's substantial underperformance against the S&P 500, combined with consistently negative earnings, negative profit margins, and a negative long-term expected return (which needs further clarification on its calculation), paints a concerning picture.  While some short-term technical indicators suggest potential upward movement, the fundamental financial weaknesses raise serious questions about long-term viability and investment potential.  Further investigation into the provided data (especially the discrepancies and the calculation of the expected return) is crucial before drawing definitive conclusions.  The current data strongly suggests that RIVN is a high-risk investment.
