## Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN), a manufacturer of electric vehicles and related technology, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While the S&P 500 exhibited a cumulative return of 28.03%, RIVN registered a cumulative loss of -57.76%. This represents a substantial divergence of -85.79%, placing it at the 4.01 percentile of the historical range of divergence between RIVN and the S&P 500 (min: -89.57%, max: 4.81%).  The provided CAGR figures (-76.7% and -90.2%) further highlight the significant underperformance against the market benchmark.  High Beta values (2.3 and 2.2) indicate a strong correlation with market volatility, implying amplified price swings compared to the broader market.  Negative alpha values (-111.7% and -118.1%) suggest that RIVN has consistently underperformed its expected return given its risk level.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last market close, RIVN's price was $10.06.  The 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages are $10.8, $10.44, and $11.54, respectively.  This indicates a recent downward trend, with the price currently below all three moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (44.55):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in neutral territory.
* **PPO (0.79):** A positive value indicates bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** The 4.01 (+ve) change in relative strength over the past 20 days suggests a recent short-term upward trend. However, this is minor considering the overall downtrend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% suggests that, at this moment, long-term (2+ years) investment in RIVN is not expected to outperform the S&P 500. Given the current price ($10.06) is near its lows, and the overall negative trend is still present, there is a strong potential for a downward movement rather than rapid increase.  However, this prediction is heavily reliant on the market remaining steady.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

Rivian's recent financial performance reveals consistent net losses, with a significant operating loss and negative EPS.  While revenue has fluctuated, it has not been sufficient to offset expenses.  The provided data lacks the expected earnings to effectively compare with actuals. A detailed earnings forecast and analyst consensus would provide better insights.  The significant net losses and negative profit margins indicate operational challenges that need to be addressed for sustainable growth.

**5. Financial Information Analysis (Revenue and Profitability & Capital and Profitability):**

Both tables show consistent losses across the quarters.  Revenue growth is inconsistent and has not translated into profitability.  Negative Return on Equity (ROE) values across all quarters point towards inefficient use of shareholder equity.  The high levels of equity are likely attributable to the substantial capital raised through funding rounds rather than internal growth.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires real-time data.  Please provide links to recent news articles, specifically those from within the last two days.)*  Information from sources like Shacknews, FINBOLD, and other reputable financial news outlets should be integrated here to provide up-to-date insights into recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

RIVN is currently experiencing significant challenges. While the recent short-term upward trend might suggest a slight recovery, the overall financial performance and comparison against the S&P 500 highlight substantial underperformance.  Negative EPS, operating losses, and negative ROE demonstrate a need for significant improvement in operational efficiency and profitability.  The company's high beta suggests substantial risk, and the low expected return indicates that current market sentiment doesn't predict outperformance of the S&P 500 in the long term.  Until operational performance and profitability improve, the investment risk for RIVN remains high.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is warranted.  Further analysis incorporating up-to-date news, analyst predictions, and detailed financial projections is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Thorough due diligence, including consideration of potential catalysts for growth and a revised outlook based on the next earnings report, is vital.  The provided data highlights a high-risk, high-volatility stock with significant underperformance relative to the market.  Long-term investors should carefully evaluate RIVN's ability to achieve profitability and consistently deliver positive returns before considering investment.
