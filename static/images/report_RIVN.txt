**1. Performance Comparison and Company Overview:**

Rivian Automotive Inc. is an American electric vehicle (EV) maker.  Over the period analyzed, RIVN underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by 3.62%.  While the negative return is concerning, the relative divergence suggests this underperformance isn't exceptionally unusual compared to its historical volatility relative to the S&P 500.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 21.0% | 82.2% | 21.0% | -0.4 | 26.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 21.0% | 82.2% | 5.0% | -0.1 | 15.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 12.0% | 78.2% | 9.0% | 0.0 | 12.7 |

**Analysis:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows relatively strong growth, particularly in the earlier periods. However, the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant periods of substantial losses.  The negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to the benchmark, while the beta shows high volatility (especially in earlier periods), exceeding the market's movements. The decreasing beta and improving Alpha across the periods suggests improved risk-adjusted return and reduced sensitivity to market fluctuations over time.  Market capitalization has also decreased considerably.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $11.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.19
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $11.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.39

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a possible short-term downtrend. The recent drop of -2.78% from the previous close signals immediate bearish sentiment.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.35 (slightly above neutral; not strongly overbought or oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.24 (positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but relatively weak)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +11.4% (short-term upward trend)
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.6331 (High Risk)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -4.2% (This suggests underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This is a projection only and subject to significant uncertainty)


The recent price drop of -2.78% is significant and may cause a further negative short-term trend. The high MRI value reinforces the high-risk assessment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |

| 2024-11-07 | -$1.44 | $1.34 B     | *(Duplicate Entry)*

**Analysis:**  Rivian continues to report significant net losses. While revenue fluctuates, there's no clear trend of consistent revenue growth.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.  Profitability is a major concern.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian shows potential for growth, indicated by past CAGR and recent revenue increases. However, significant challenges remain, including high volatility, consistent net losses, negative profit margins, and a high Market Risk Indicator. The recent price drop suggests a bearish sentiment.  The projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-4.2%) further raises concerns.  Before investing, a thorough investigation into the company's future plans to achieve profitability and sustainable growth is crucial.  The provided data suggests a high-risk investment with significant uncertainty regarding future returns.  Further analysis of competitive landscape and future projections is necessary before making an informed investment decision.
