**6. Overall Analysis:**

RIVN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting consistent negative alpha and substantial losses.  While recent revenue shows some improvement, profitability remains deeply negative. The high market risk indicator (MRI) reinforces the substantial risk associated with this investment.  The recent price surge requires further investigation into the underlying reasons. Long-term investors should carefully consider the negative expected return and the company's precarious financial position before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended, including examining the causes for the recent price increase and the sustainability of the Q4 2024 profit margin improvement.  The inconsistent data points (especially the duplicate earnings entry and volatile beta) require clarification from additional reliable sources.
