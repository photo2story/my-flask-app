**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian's stock performance is currently weak, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  The company's financial statements reveal consistent losses and negative ROE, raising serious concerns about its long-term viability. While recent price movements show some short-term upward fluctuations, the negative expected return and persistent losses warrant caution.  Investors should carefully consider the inherent risks before investing in RIVN. Further investigation into the reasons behind the inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicated earnings data) is crucial before drawing definitive conclusions.  The provided -72.6% expected return should be interpreted with significant skepticism due to the reliance on historical data and modeling assumptions.  It is not a reliable prediction of future performance.
