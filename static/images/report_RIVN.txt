**2. Recent Price Movement:**

| Metric           | Value     |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Closing Price     | $10.02    |
| 5-Day MA         | $10.07    |
| 20-Day MA        | $10.40    |
| 60-Day MA        | $11.27    |

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend. The relatively small gap between the closing price and the 5-day MA suggests recent price stability, but the wider gap to the 20-day and 60-day MAs indicates a longer-term downtrend.  The last market price of $10.24 is slightly higher than the closing price, implying a small upward movement during the trading day.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (48.82):**  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating potential for movement in either direction.
* **PPO (-0.11):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Imbalance Change (-3.26):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% suggests that, at this time, there's no significant expectation of outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This should be viewed with caution given the companyâ€™s historical performance.  The $10.24 last market price being higher than the closing price does not indicate a significant event like a sudden surge or crash, given the small difference.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -1.08    | 0.87         |
