**7. Summary:**

Rivian (RIVN) shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with consistently negative earnings and declining equity. Technical indicators are mixed, suggesting a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment. The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity, meaning price swings are likely to be substantial in either direction.  The company faces significant challenges in terms of profitability and achieving sustainable growth. While long-term investors could benefit from the potential upside of the EV market, the substantially greater risk associated with RIVN makes a similar return to the S&P 500 much less certain. Without the inclusion of recent news and analyst opinions, a detailed evaluation of current market sentiment remains incomplete.  The consistent net losses and negative ROE are serious red flags which need further investigation and resolution to make RIVN a viable long-term investment.

**8.  Recommendation:**

Given the consistent losses, negative ROE, and substantial underperformance relative to the market, a cautious approach is advised.  More research is required considering the current news and market analysis before making an investment decision.  The high risk profile makes RIVN only suitable for investors with a high risk tolerance and a long-term horizon, fully accepting the potential for significant losses.  Consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
