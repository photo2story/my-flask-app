## Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) Stock Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) is an American electric vehicle manufacturer.  As of the last data point, RIVN's cumulative return is -35.52%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 31.84%. The difference is a substantial -67.4%, placing it in the 11.9th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a considerable underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance metrics over the periods analyzed. While CAGR shows improving returns, the high and volatile Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlights significant risk.  The Alpha consistently near zero suggests the stock's returns are largely explained by market movements (Beta), with little unique performance. The shrinking market capitalization (Cap(B)) also needs to be considered.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 12.0% | 0.0 | 23.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -18.0% | 0.0 | 13.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 16.0% | 31.7% | -46.0% | 0.0 | 12.8 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.62

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price increase (+$0.72 from the previous close) needs further investigation to determine if it's a sustainable trend or a temporary fluctuation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (32.29):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-1.62):**  A negative value shows bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+1.8):** Suggests a short-term upward trend.

The conflicting signals from the technical indicators warrant caution. The significant price change in the `Last-market` data (+0.72) suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the long-term expected return of -144.1% is extremely negative relative to the S&P 500, suggesting a high-risk, high-uncertainty investment. This expected return strongly warns against long-term investment unless significant changes occur.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company is consistently reporting significant net losses (negative EPS) despite relatively stable revenue.  There's no clear trend of improving profitability. The increase in revenue from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 is followed by a significant drop in Q2 2024 and a slight increase in Q3 2024. Revenue is showing some instability, while profitability remains very poor.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |

**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability metrics show a volatile and generally negative picture. Profit margins are deeply negative, indicating substantial losses. While revenue fluctuates, it doesn't translate into improved profitability.  Equity is also declining,  and Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, highlighting the company's struggles to generate returns for its shareholders.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

RIVN's performance is significantly lagging the S&P 500, showing consistent losses and negative profitability. While some technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce, the overall financial picture is concerning. The extremely negative long-term expected return (-144.1%) underscores significant risk.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering any investment in RIVN.  The current situation suggests a high-risk, high-uncertainty investment with little evidence of sustainable long-term growth.  Further research into the company's future product pipeline and overall business strategy is crucial before making any investment decisions.
