## Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Rivian Automotive Inc. is an American electric vehicle manufacturer.  The company's stock performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  Recent price movements show a short-term upward trend, but the long-term outlook is uncertain, indicated by negative expected returns and inconsistent financial performance.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (RIVN):** -28.31%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 15.73%
* **Return Difference:** -44.04% (RIVN underperformed VOO by 44.04%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 38.4% (Indicates RIVN is performing significantly worse than the S&P 500 relative to its historical range of underperformance).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals significant inconsistency.  While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows improvement from negative to positive values over the projected periods, the high maximum drawdown (MDD) highlights significant risk.  The near-zero alpha suggests that RIVN has not generated excess returns compared to the market (beta).  The decreasing beta values over time might indicate a decreasing correlation to the market, possibly due to company-specific events and reduced market sensitivity.  Capitalization shows a steady decrease.


**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -2.0% | 76.0% | -17.0% | 26.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 20.0% | 76.0% | -6.0% | 15.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 25.0% | 76.0% | -0.1 | 15.7 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.66
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $11.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.03

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, the relatively small difference between the price and the moving averages indicates the trend is not strongly established.  The recent price change of 2.71% represents a modest positive movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 71.05 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction)
* **PPO:** 1.95 (Positive value suggests bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.3% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -57.9% (Significant negative expected return over the long term relative to the S&P 500).  This highlights substantial risk involved.

The sharp price increase (`change`: 2.71%) from the previous close should be noted.  While this indicates a recent upward trend, it needs to be interpreted cautiously in light of the other indicators and the negative long-term outlook.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -1.08   | $0.87 B      |
| 2024-08-06 | -1.46   | $1.16 B      |

| 2024-11-07 | -1.44   | $1.34 B      |

The company consistently reports negative EPS. Revenue shows some fluctuation, but there's no clear upward trend. The duplicated entry for 2024-11-07 needs clarification.  This data points to ongoing financial challenges.

| 2023-12-31 | $9.14B | -16.64% |

The financial statements reveal inconsistent profitability with significant negative profit margins and ROE. While Q4 2024 shows a positive profit margin, the overall picture indicates substantial financial challenges and the need for improved operational efficiency.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian's stock performance is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500.  While recent price movements show a short-term uptrend, the negative expected return, persistent negative EPS, fluctuating revenue, and inconsistent profitability raise significant concerns.  The high maximum drawdown in the Alpha/Beta analysis further emphasizes the risk involved.  Investors should proceed with caution, conducting thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions. The company needs to demonstrate consistent profitability and revenue growth to improve investor confidence.  The positive profit margin in Q4 2024 is a positive signal but insufficient to offset the overall negative picture.
