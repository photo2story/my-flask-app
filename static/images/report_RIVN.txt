* **20-Day Moving Average:** $10.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $11.17

* **PPO (0.86):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum.

**4. Recent Financials and Outlook:**

The provided financial statements show consistent net losses (negative EPS) and a negative profit margin throughout the reported quarters. Revenue is relatively stable, hovering around $1 billion per quarter. While revenue is increasing, the company is not yet profitable.  The lack of an earnings forecast for the most recent period prevents a comprehensive assessment of future expectations.


**6. Financial Data Analysis:**

Both revenue and profitability data reveal persistent losses.  The negative profit margins and negative ROE (Return on Equity) across all quarters highlight the company's ongoing struggle to achieve profitability.  The declining equity suggests potential issues with capital management or ongoing losses.

**8. Summary of Analysis:**

Rivian Automotive (RIVN) is currently experiencing significant challenges.  Its substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500, consistent losses, negative profit margins and ROE, and a 0% expected return against the S&P 500 present a bearish outlook. While recent price movements show a short-term upward trend, this is not a strong indicator of a sustained recovery.  Further investigation into recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a comprehensive assessment. The high volatility adds considerable risk to any investment.  The company needs to demonstrate a clear path to profitability to improve investor confidence.
