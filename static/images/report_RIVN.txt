*   **RIVN Cumulative Return:** -6.32%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 30.56%
*   **Divergence:** -36.88 (Current), Relative Divergence: 23.7
*   **Analysis:** Rivian has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500. A divergence of -36.88% means that if you invested in RIVN at the same time as VOO, you'd be down approximately 37 percentage points relative to the S&P 500. The relative divergence of 23.7 indicates that this performance is relatively closer to Rivian's historical minimum underperformance against VOO. The Alpha/Beta analysis provides further insights, revealing the company's inconsistent performance in the past:
    *   **2021-2023:** Shows positive alpha (outperforming the market on a risk-adjusted basis) and a beta greater than 1 (more volatile than the market).
    *   **2022-2024:** A negative alpha indicates underperformance, and the low beta suggests it was less reactive to market movements.
    *   **2023-2025:** Negative alpha and beta imply significant underperformance and an inverse correlation with market trends.
    *   **CAGR:** fluctuating yearly between 5-39%, but MDD high near 80%, indicating that Rivian stock poses considerable risk, despite periods of robust growth.
