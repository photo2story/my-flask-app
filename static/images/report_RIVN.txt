2025-02-19 - Analysis Report
## Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) Stock Report

**Executive Summary:** Rivian Automotive Inc. is an electric vehicle manufacturer.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a substantial negative return despite recent positive short-term momentum indicators.  Financial data is limited, hindering a comprehensive evaluation of its long-term prospects.  While short-term indicators suggest potential upward movement, substantial long-term risks remain due to negative earnings and the lack of comprehensive financial data.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Rivian's cumulative return of -24.57% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's 33.23% return.  The divergence is -57.8%, placing it at the 21.5th percentile of its historical range (relative divergence).  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results across the different periods:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 12.0% | 0.0 | 23.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -18.0% | 0.0 | 13.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 27.0% | 31.7% | -36.0% | 0.0 | 14.7 |

Note that the alpha values seem unrealistic; an alpha of 12.0% for a period where the stock massively underperformed the market is not possible. This suggests potential errors in the data provided.  The beta close to zero across all periods suggests relatively low correlation with the market, although this needs verification with more robust data.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.34

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $13.13

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 68.85 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.42 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.1% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -70.9% (Significantly negative return relative to the S&P 500). This suggests substantial risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -1.08   | $0.87 B     |

| 2024-11-07 | -1.44   | $1.34 B     | *(Duplicate Entry)*

Rivian is consistently reporting significant net losses. Revenue is growing, but the losses are concerning and need further investigation of their underlying causes.  The duplicate entry for 2024-11-07 requires clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of crucial financial data like Total Revenue and Gross Profit significantly limits the analysis.  Without this information, it is impossible to assess the company's financial health and profitability accurately.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian's stock performance has been significantly weak compared to the S&P 500.  While short-term technical indicators show some positive momentum, the company's consistent net losses and the lack of key financial data raise substantial concerns about its long-term viability. The projected negative long-term return further emphasizes the substantial risk associated with investing in RIVN.  More robust financial data is needed before a more comprehensive and reliable investment recommendation can be made. The conflicting Alpha values suggest errors in the provided data set requires careful review of data sources.
