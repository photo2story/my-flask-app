## Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN), a manufacturer of electric vehicles and related technology, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for RIVN is -57.76%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 28.03%. This represents a substantial divergence of -85.79%, placing it at the 4.01 percentile of the historical range of divergence (minimum -89.57%, maximum 4.81%).  The provided CAGR figures (-76.7% and -90.2%) further emphasize the significant underperformance compared to the broader market.

The negative alpha values (-111.7% and -118.1%) suggest that RIVN has significantly underperformed the market benchmark even after adjusting for its beta.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $10.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $10.80
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $10.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $11.54

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages might indicate some consolidation, but the distance from the 60-day MA suggests further downside potential.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 44.55  - This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to the oversold territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.79 - A positive value indicates bullish momentum, but its relatively small magnitude suggests weak momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +4.01 - Indicates short-term upward movement relative to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The expected return of 0% suggests that, based on the current data, a long-term (2+ years) investment in RIVN is not expected to outperform the S&P 500. This is a crucial point indicating a significant risk-return imbalance.

The current price of $10.06 is not exceptionally high or low considering recent trends; however, given the overall negative performance and low expected return, it does not necessarily represent a compelling buying opportunity.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

Rivian's recent financial results show consistent losses, with increasing revenue but significant negative EPS (Earnings Per Share).  While revenue has shown some growth, the company continues to experience substantial operating losses. The most recent earnings report (2024-11-07) shows an EPS of -1.08 and revenue of $0.87B.  This needs to be compared to analyst expectations for a complete assessment; the provided data lacks this context.


**5.  Quarterly Financial Data Analysis (Revenue and Profitability & Capital and Profitability):**

The provided quarterly data reveals a consistent trend of negative profitability. Although revenue increased in Q2 2024, it decreased again in Q3, with a considerably lower profit margin.  ROE (Return on Equity) has also been consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity. The high equity values might reflect significant investment, but without profitability, this is not sustainable long-term.

**7.  Comprehensive Analysis (Summary of points 1-6):**

Rivian Automotive, despite its innovative products, is currently facing significant financial challenges.  The company shows consistent losses, a negative ROE, and substantial underperformance relative to the broader market. While there might be short-term bullish signals based on some technical indicators, the overall picture suggests a high-risk investment with a low expected return in comparison to a diversified index fund like VOO.  The negative trend in profitability and the persistent losses raise serious concerns about the company's long-term sustainability.  Further investigation into recent news, analyst opinions, and expectations for future profitability is crucial before making any investment decision.  The current price, while not exceptionally high, does not represent a compelling buying opportunity given the significant risks involved.
