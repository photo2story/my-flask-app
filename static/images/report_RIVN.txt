**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian is currently facing significant headwinds. While there are some positive short-term indicators (price movement above moving averages, slightly positive PPO), the long-term outlook is very concerning.  The company is highly unprofitable, its stock is significantly underperforming the market, and its financial health is weak.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution and carefully consider the substantial risks involved.  The extremely negative projected long-term return compared to the S&P 500 strongly suggests that significant improvements in profitability and operational efficiency are necessary before considering a long-term investment.  The data indicates a high level of risk and uncertainty.
