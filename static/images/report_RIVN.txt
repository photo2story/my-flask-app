As of the last data point, RIVN's cumulative return is -25.13%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 31.73%.  This represents a divergence of -56.9%, placing it at the 22.4th percentile of its historical range of divergence (max: 20.8%, min: -79.3%).  The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta analysis show inconsistent performance over the given periods, with negative alpha suggesting underperformance relative to the market benchmark.

* **Closing Price:** $14.70
* **5-day Moving Average:** $14.47
* **20-day Moving Average:** $12.50
* **60-day Moving Average:** $11.18

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **PPO:** 1.85 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.8% (Short-term upward movement)

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, potentially indicating a short-term correction.  The positive PPO supports the short-term bullish trend. The provided expected return of 0.0% for long-term (2+ years) investment suggests that, at current valuations, the market does not anticipate significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500. A price of $14.70 does not suggest an extreme price movement event (rapid surge or decline) based on the provided context.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a consistent pattern of negative EPS and fluctuating revenue.  Revenue peaked in Q3 2023 at $1.34B and has since declined, possibly indicating some slowing of growth.  EPS has remained consistently negative across all reported quarters. There is no information regarding whether these results beat or missed expectations.  Noteworthy is the repeated entry for 2024-11-07. This may be a data entry error, or represent a restatement, but this ambiguity impacts the analysis.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial information reveals persistent negative profit margins and a declining ROE.  While revenue was relatively stable in the first half of 2023, it decreased in the later quarters of 2024, along with the equity. The negative ROE suggests the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook, analyst opinions, or performance highlights are provided in the given data.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

RIVN shows a mixed picture.  While recent price action suggests a short-term bullish trend, supported by positive PPO, the high RSI suggests potential overbought conditions.  The company's financial performance is concerning, with consistent negative EPS and profit margins, declining revenue, and a negative ROE.  The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the lack of positive expectations regarding long-term outperformance raise serious concerns.  More information, particularly concerning analyst expectations and the clarification of the duplicate data entry, is needed for a thorough assessment.  Based solely on the provided data, the investment outlook is currently bearish.

Conduct thorough independent research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.  The missing context (e.g., analyst expectations, news, and the potential duplication of Q4 2024 data) significantly limits the scope and reliability of this analysis.
