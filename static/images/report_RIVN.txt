**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 5.0%    | 80.4% | 12.0%   | 1.2   | 28.8   |
| 2022-2024  | 12.0%   | 80.4% | -9.0%   | 0.1   | 16.3   |
| 2023-2025  | 77.0%   | 77.7% | 10.0%   | -0.0  | 25.6   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth rate over the specified periods. Note the large variance between the different periods, likely reflecting Rivian's early growth stage and market volatility.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Very high in all periods, indicating significant risk and volatility. Drawdowns of 80% are substantial.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the stock's performance relative to its benchmark (presumably the market). Positive alpha indicates outperformance, negative indicates underperformance. The alpha varies greatly.
*   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A beta of 1.2 (2021-2023) indicates higher volatility than the market. Beta around 0 suggests low correlation.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization in Billions.

**Analysis:** Rivian's performance has been highly volatile. The MDD figures point to significant risk. While the company has periods of outperformance (positive alpha, strong CAGR in 2023-2025), the inconsistency and high volatility are key concerns.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** $20.90
*   **Last-market Change:** -1.09% (Slight decrease from previous close)
*   **5-day SMA:** $21.48
*   **20-day SMA:** $18.74
*   **60-day SMA:** $15.75

**Analysis:** The 5-day SMA is above the current price and also above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA. This indicates a short-term downtrend after a longer-term uptrend. Recent price decrease reflects the fluctuation issue (sharp decline).

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended - potentially indicating an algorithm-driven signal, requires further scrutiny)
*   **RSI:** 62.90 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a pullback).
*   **PPO:** 1.04 (Positive, indicating the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average – confirming the recent uptrend, but the value is small).
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" (Aggressive signal suggesting full investment - further scrutiny on the MRI signal is required)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 29.6% (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -8.5% (Negative, suggesting potential underperformance compared to the current price if held long-term)

**Analysis:** The signals are somewhat conflicting. The MRI and Hybrid Signal suggest a strong buy, while the RSI is nearing overbought territory, and the Expected Return is negative. The recent increase in relative divergence reinforces the recent short-term price increase.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Focus on Future Predictions:** Many headlines revolve around price predictions for Rivian's stock in 2026 and beyond.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** The articles from The Motley Fool suggest a buy recommendation, while others analyze price surges and the upcoming R2 vehicle launch.
*   **Institutional Activity:** Vontobel Holding Ltd. selling shares could indicate a lack of confidence from at least one institutional investor.
*   **R2 Launch Hype:** The buzz around the upcoming R2 launch is generating positive sentiment.

**Analysis:** News is a mix of positive predictions and some caution. The focus on future predictions highlights the speculative nature of the stock. Institutional selling is a slight negative, but the overall sentiment appears cautiously optimistic.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold

**Analysis:** Revenue is growing but has some seasonality. Profit margins are highly volatile and generally weak (some quarters even negative). ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, indicating poor profitability relative to shareholders' equity, and equity has been generally decreasing.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Growth Stock with High Risk:** Rivian is a growth stock with significant potential but also substantial risk.
*   **Underperforming the Market:** RIVN has underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **High Volatility:** MDD and beta analysis reveal high volatility, making it a risky investment.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with some bullish signals offset by concerns about overbought conditions and negative expected returns.
*   **Analyst Neutrality:** Analysts are generally neutral on the stock, with an average target price below the current price.
*   **Consistent Losses:** Rivian is not yet profitable, and EPS is consistently negative. Although Revenue is growing, profitability remains a key challenge.
*   **Upcoming R2 Launch:** The upcoming launch of the R2 vehicle is a significant potential catalyst.
*   **Market Sentiment:** Recent news reflects both optimism and caution, with a focus on future predictions.
*   **Institutional Selling:** At least one institution has recently reduced its holdings.
* **The MRI should be reviewed and investigated for accuracy before using the High Investment recommendation. This is because the hybrid signal should be cash_100%_sell instead of cash_0%_buy, if the expected return is negative.**

**Overall Recommendation:** Investing in Rivian is speculative and carries significant risk. Potential investors should carefully weigh the company's growth prospects against its financial challenges, high volatility, and negative profitability. Given the conflicting signals and the analyst's neutral stance, a cautious approach is warranted. Pay close attention to the upcoming R2 launch and any further news regarding the company's path to profitability. Further investigation of the Market Risk Indicator (MRI) is warranted before following its recommendation, as this could be a machine-generated recommendation.
