The provided data shows that RIVN significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return of -36.98% compared to VOO's 10.08%. The -47.06% difference highlights a substantial underperformance.  The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance across different time periods (2021-2023 showing negative CAGR and 2022-2024, 2023-2025 showing positive CAGRs). Beta values generally indicate high market sensitivity.  The large maximum drawdown (MDD) suggests significant price volatility.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -2.0% | 76.0% | -17.0% | 26.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 20.0% | 76.0% | -6.0% | 15.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $11.49
* **5-day Moving Average:** $11.67
* **20-day Moving Average:** $11.88
* **60-day Moving Average:** $12.08

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The recent price change of -3.53% from the previous close further supports this observation.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.95 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.0453 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.9 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -68.7% (This indicates a significantly negative expected return, implying substantial risk and low projected gains)

The -3.53% price change suggests a recent downward trend, despite the short-term positive relative divergence. The significantly negative expected return coupled with a medium market risk suggests caution. The low RSI value hints at potential oversold conditions, but further analysis is needed.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has consistently reported negative EPS over the past few quarters, indicating losses. While revenue has shown some growth, it has not been enough to offset the losses.  The repetition of the 2024-11-07 data entry suggests a potential data error.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue    |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -1.08  | 0.87 B$    |
| 2024-08-06 | -1.46  | 1.16 B$    |
| 2024-05-07 | -1.48  | 1.20 B$    |
| 2023-11-07 | -1.44  | 1.34 B$    |
| 2024-11-07 | -1.44  | 1.34 B$    |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability tables show mixed results. While revenue is somewhat fluctuating, it remains inconsistent with the company's overall financial position. Profit margins are consistently negative, indicating operational challenges. Return on Equity (ROE) is also consistently negative, highlighting a concerning issue with capital utilization.

| 2024-12-31 | $1.73B   | 9.80%         |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian Automotive (RIVN) presents a high-risk investment. While the company operates in a potentially lucrative sector (EVs), its current financial performance is weak, characterized by consistent losses and negative profit margins. The stock price is trending downward, and technical indicators suggest bearish momentum. Although the RSI approaches oversold territory, the negative expected return and significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 raise considerable concerns.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy would require a very high risk tolerance given the current projections.  Further investigation into the companyâ€™s future plans, production capacity, and market positioning is crucial before any investment decision.  The duplicated data entries in the earnings data require clarification.
