## Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) Stock Report

**0. Summary Statistics:**

Rivian Automotive Inc. is an American electric vehicle maker.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While recent price action shows some positive momentum, fundamental performance remains weak with negative profitability.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Rivian (RIVN) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) index.  As of the last data point, RIVN's cumulative return is -31.79%, while VOO's is 8.57%. This represents a substantial difference of -40.4%, placing it at the 25.6th percentile of its historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-64.7% to 30.4%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance across different time periods.  While 2023-2025 shows a positive CAGR (18%), the Alpha is near zero, suggesting the outperformance may be due to market factors rather than company-specific strength.  High Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) across all periods highlight significant risk.  The shrinking market capitalization further reflects the stock's struggles.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2021-2023  | -9.0% | 44.7% | -1.0% | 0.4 | 28.3 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.45

* **5-day Moving Average:** $12.47
* **20-day Moving Average:** $11.48
* **60-day Moving Average:** $12.58

The price is above its 20-day moving average, suggesting short-term upward momentum, but below its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term bearish trend.  The recent +6.75% jump warrants further investigation into any news or events that might have caused this sudden increase.

The negative expected return highlights the significant risk associated with long-term investment in RIVN. The significant daily price jump needs further investigation to explain the rapid change.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian is currently facing significant challenges. While recent price action shows short-term positive movement, the company's fundamental performance is weak, with persistent losses and negative profit margins.  The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, along with a negative long-term expected return, suggests high risk for investors.  Further investigation into the cause of the recent price surge is warranted.  Investors should carefully consider these factors before making any investment decisions.  The high risk and negative outlook should be strongly considered.
