## Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) Stock Report

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) is an American electric vehicle (EV) maker and manufacturer of electric vehicles, and related products and services.

As of the last data point, RIVN's cumulative return is -35.63%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 33.58%.  The divergence between RIVN and VOO is -69.2%, placing it at the 10.1 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500. This indicates a substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided CAGR figures also show consistent negative returns, highlighting persistent underperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.49
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.44

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The relatively close proximity of the 60-day moving average to the closing price might indicate potential support levels, but the negative trend across the moving averages is notable.  The recent price drop of -$1.58 from the previous close also highlights the current negative momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.73 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -2.03 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -13.7% (Significantly negative, confirming a short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term, 2+ years):** -172.5% (This significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 indicates a high risk investment with a potentially very low probability of outperforming the market).


The significant negative change in price (-$1.58) from the previous close underscores the recent downward pressure.  While the RSI is approaching oversold levels, it's not yet a strong buy signal. The combination of negative PPO, significant negative relative divergence, and extremely negative expected return suggests caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent and substantial net losses for Rivian across the reported quarters. While revenue shows some growth, it's not sufficient to offset the significant losses. The persistent negative EPS highlights the company's ongoing struggle with profitability.  There's also a duplicate entry for 2024-11-07.  Data inconsistencies require verification.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals consistently negative profit margins and a declining ROE.  The company is burning through equity and its profitability remains elusive. The substantial negative profit margins indicate significant operational inefficiencies or unsustainable pricing strategies.

|-------------|------------|---------------|-------------|---------|

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian is currently experiencing significant financial challenges.  The consistent negative earnings, declining ROE, and substantial negative profit margins paint a concerning picture.  While the company operates in a potentially high-growth sector (EVs), its current performance drastically underperforms the market, and the projected long-term return is extremely negative relative to the S&P 500.  The technical indicators do not currently suggest a strong buy signal.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering any investment in RIVN.  The risk profile is very high.
