* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% suggests that, based on the available data, long-term (2+ years) returns relative to the S&P 500 are not expected to be positive.  This needs further investigation, as the 0% return may simply be a lack of predictive capability in the provided model. The current price of $10.05 is not notably high or low in relation to recent volatility; however, it is important to note that this statement is without context of prior pricing.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data reveals consistent losses (negative EPS) and declining revenue growth from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024.  While revenue was $1.34B in Q3 2023, it dropped to $0.87B in Q3 2024.  Gross margins also remain extremely low with negative profitability. The latest earnings report (2024-11-07) shows an EPS of -1.08 and revenue of $0.87B, which is below expectations (Further information on the expectations is needed to provide a more in-depth analysis).  The negative EPS trend is a significant concern.


**5. Financial Information (Revenue and Profitability, Capital and Profitability):**

Both sets of financial data show consistently negative profitability (negative profit margins and negative ROE).  While revenue fluctuates, it is declining since its peak in 2023. Equity is also declining, implying that the company is losing value. This lack of profitability and declining equity is a major red flag.
