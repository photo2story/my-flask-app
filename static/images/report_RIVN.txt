**1. Performance Comparison and Company Overview:**

Rivian Automotive Inc. is an American electric vehicle (EV) maker and manufacturer of electric trucks, SUVs, and delivery vans.

RIVN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, lagging by 62.9%.  While the provided data shows some projected positive CAGR in the future, the current performance reflects substantial losses. The high maximum drawdown (MDD) across all years further highlights the significant risk associated with this investment.  The near-zero alpha suggests the stock's returns haven't significantly outperformed or underperformed its beta (market risk), indicating its price movements are largely dictated by broader market trends.  The decreasing market capitalization over the provided periods is also a concern.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 12.0% | 0.0 | 23.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -18.0% | 0.0 | 13.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 20.0% | 31.7% | -41.0% | 0.0 | 13.3 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.99
* **5-day Moving Average:** $12.78
* **20-day Moving Average:** $13.00
* **60-day Moving Average:** $12.90

The price is currently slightly below its 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, it's above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating some support. The recent price increase of 4.09% from the previous close signals a positive short-term momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.51 (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.)
* **PPO:** -0.14 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.6 (Short-term upward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** -99.2% (This extremely negative expected return suggests a highly pessimistic outlook for long-term returns relative to the S&P 500. This should be considered with extreme caution as it is an unusual value.)


The recent price increase (4.09%) from the previous close indicates a potential short-term bounce, but the negative PPO and extremely low expected return signal caution.  The large negative expected return needs further clarification and investigation as it contradicts other findings.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian (RIVN) shows significant underperformance against the S&P 500, characterized by consistent net losses, negative profit margins, and declining revenue.  While short-term price fluctuations may occur, the underlying financial health of the company raises serious concerns. The extremely negative projected long-term return warrants a thorough review of the data source and methodology used to calculate this figure, as such a low expected return is highly unusual.  The high MDD further highlights the significant risk involved.  Investors should carefully consider these factors before investing in RIVN.  Further investigation into the extreme negative projected return and data inconsistencies is crucial before making any investment decisions.
