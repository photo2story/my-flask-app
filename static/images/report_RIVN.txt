**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.44
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.70
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $12.95
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.93

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent drop of -4.23% from the previous close reinforces this negative sentiment.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 46.2  - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to oversold territory.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -3.5% - Shows a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -128.5% - This extremely negative expected return projection necessitates a critical review of the methodology used to arrive at this figure.  It suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon (2+ years). The significant price drop in the ‘Last-market’ data indicates a potentially relevant event causing this negative trend.
