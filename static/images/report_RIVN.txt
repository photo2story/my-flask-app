* **Closing Price:** $12.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.8877
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.4798

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase of 2.24% might be a temporary rebound, given the broader downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 47.53 – This is near the neutral level (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** -2.01 –  A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -15.1 – This shows a recent decrease in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** -121.9% – This indicates a significant projected loss over the long term relative to the S&P 500.  This extremely negative forecast should be treated with caution and warrants further investigation into the underlying assumptions.  It does not indicate a likely scenario based on historical context and needs further analysis. The recent price change (2.24%) is relatively small given the large negative projected return.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent negative Earnings Per Share (EPS) and relatively stable, yet declining, revenue. While revenue was relatively stable, the company is consistently unprofitable, with increasing losses. The slight increase in revenue in the latest quarter does not compensate for the continued negative EPS.  This needs further scrutiny of underlying business operations and the reasons for recurring losses.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

RIVN is currently exhibiting significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, characterized by negative returns, a high maximum drawdown, and consistently negative EPS and profit margins.  While the recent price showed a slight increase, the technical indicators and long-term projected returns suggest a bearish outlook.  The company's fundamental financial health shows persistent losses and declining equity.  The extremely negative projected return (-121.9%) should be viewed with extreme caution, and requires further investigation and verification of the methods and assumptions utilized to generate this prediction.  Given these factors, a cautious approach is warranted.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons behind the consistent losses and whether the company's long-term growth strategy is viable.
