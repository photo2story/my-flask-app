**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Rivian Automotive Inc. is an American electric vehicle (EV) maker and developer of EV trucks and SUVs.

The cumulative return of RIVN (-3.34%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a 4.18% return. The difference of -7.5% places RIVN below the S&P 500, but the relative divergence of 24.6% suggests this underperformance is not at the extreme end of its historical range relative to VOO.  The provided alpha and beta analysis shows highly variable results depending on the timeframe considered, highlighting the volatility inherent in this relatively young company.

Rivian shows significant revenue growth in Q4 2024 but continues to operate at a loss.  The negative ROE across all quarters indicates the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RIVN's performance has been volatile and significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently. While the long-term expected return is positive, the high risk (indicated by the MRI and negative ROE), consistent losses, and recent price drop suggest substantial uncertainty.  The company's future success depends heavily on its ability to increase production, manage costs, and gain market share in a highly competitive EV market.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential high rewards against the significant risks before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence, including a thorough review of the company's financials and future prospects, is strongly recommended.  The presence of duplicate data entries also highlights a potential data quality issue requiring further investigation.
