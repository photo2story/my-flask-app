**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

Given the closing price of $14.37 and the high RSI, there's a risk of a near-term correction.  The current situation suggests a potential for a short-term pullback before a continuation of the upward trend.

The provided earnings data reveals a consistent pattern of losses (negative EPS) over the past five quarters.  Revenue has fluctuated, showing no clear upward trend.
