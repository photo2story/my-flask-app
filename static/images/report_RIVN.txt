The cumulative return for RIVN is -51.3%, while the S&P 500 shows a 32.48% return. This represents a considerable divergence of -83.8%.  The relative divergence of 6.1% indicates that its performance is near the lower bound of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) further underscores the underperformance, showing negative values for both 2021-2023 and 2022-2024.  High Beta values (10.4 - 23.8) suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  A high negative Alpha indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $10.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $10.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $11.17

The price is currently slightly above its short-term moving averages but below its 60-day moving average, suggesting some recent price recovery but with potential for further consolidation.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.9 – Indicates short-term upward movement.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – This suggests that at the current juncture, there's no significant expected return for RIVN relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, considering current conditions.  A more sophisticated model incorporating risk factors would be needed for a more reliable projection.
* **Note:** There's no mention of a significant price event impacting the recent market price.  The minor difference between last market and closing prices doesn't warrant labeling it as a "sharp jump" or "sharp drop."

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows consistent negative EPS and a generally flat revenue trend.  The last reported EPS (-$1.08) is considerably worse than the previous quarters, indicating a worsening financial situation.  Missing are the expected EPS and revenue figures for the latest earnings report for a complete comparison.  A deeper dive into the causes behind the negative EPS and revenue stagnation is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The company's high burn rate is a key concern reflected in the negative profitability across several quarters.

**5.  Quarterly Financial Data Analysis:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability sections show a consistently negative trend.  Revenue growth is mostly stagnant, and profitability is extremely poor, showing significant losses. ROE (Return on Equity) is deeply negative throughout the provided period. This signifies significant challenges facing the company's financial health.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

(This section requires access to real-time news sources like Shacknews and Finbold.  Information from these sources on RIVN's recent performance, analyst opinions, and market outlook should be incorporated here.  This would include details from the recent earnings announcement, if any. )


**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

RIVN is currently facing significant headwinds.  While the recent price action shows slight positivity, the underlying financial performance remains concerning.  Consistently negative EPS, high burn rate, and negative ROE indicate major challenges in profitability and sustainability.  The underperformance against the S&P 500 is substantial and persistent. Technical indicators suggest neutral to slightly positive momentum, but this should be viewed with caution given the overall financial situation.  Further investigation into the causes of the negative earnings and revenue stagnation is crucial.  The lack of significant positive news and analyst support, based on current knowledge, doesn't support a bullish outlook.  Until the company demonstrates a clear path to profitability and improved financial health, a cautiously bearish outlook would be prudent.
