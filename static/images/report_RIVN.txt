## Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) Stock Analysis

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN), an American electric vehicle maker, based on provided financial data.  We will examine its performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key technical indicators, earnings, and financial health.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Rivian's cumulative return (-34.80%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500's return (28.66%). The difference (-63.5%) places it at the 14.6th percentile of its historical range (max: +19.9%, min: -77.8%). This indicates a substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 13.0% | 0.0 | 23.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -16.0% | 0.0 | 13.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 17.0% | 31.7% | -41.0% | 0.0 | 12.7 |

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows some improvement over time, but the negative alpha values across all periods suggest underperformance compared to a benchmark, even considering the Beta of 0.0 which suggests low correlation to the market.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) highlights significant risk associated with the investment.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.48
* **5-day Moving Average:** $12.64
* **20-day Moving Average:** $12.91
* **60-day Moving Average:** $12.94

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price increase (+$0.32) from the previous close shows a small positive movement, but the overall trend remains bearish considering its position relative to the moving averages.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 49.84 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.21 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.3 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -116.4% (Significant negative expected return relative to S&P 500)


The technical indicators show mixed signals. While RSI is neutral, the negative PPO and negative relative divergence suggest bearish momentum.  The extremely negative expected return highlights a significant risk associated with long-term investment in RIVN relative to the S&P 500. The recent small price increase is not substantial enough to counteract the overall negative outlook.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08 | $0.87B        |
