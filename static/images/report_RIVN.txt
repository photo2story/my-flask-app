**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Rivian Automotive Inc. is an American electric vehicle manufacturer.  The provided data shows RIVN significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return difference of -47.6% highlights a substantial underperformance.  The relative divergence of 33.6% indicates that while underperforming, the current situation is not the worst it's been historically.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -2.0% | 76.0% | -17.0% | 0.0 | 26.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 20.0% | 76.0% | -6.0% | 0.0 | 15.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 16.0% | 76.0% | -0.1 | 12.8 |

This shows inconsistent performance and significant negative alpha, indicating underperformance relative to the market. The beta fluctuates, suggesting varying sensitivity to market movements. The shrinking market capitalization is also concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $11.36
* **5-day Moving Average:** $11.50
* **20-day Moving Average:** $11.86
* **60-day Moving Average:** $12.01

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase of 1.88% from the previous close might be a temporary bounce.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 32.98 (Suggests oversold conditions, but not necessarily a buy signal.)
* **PPO:** -0.31 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum.)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.1 (Slight short-term upward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** -71.0% (This extremely negative long-term expected return is concerning and warrants further investigation of the underlying assumptions.)

The recent price change of 1.88% is a minor upward movement and doesn't indicate a significant reversal.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a major red flag.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |

| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | -17.92% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.14B | -16.64% |


The financial data reveals significant challenges. While revenue increased in Q4 2024, profitability remains highly volatile and largely negative.  ROE is also consistently negative, highlighting the company's struggles to generate returns on invested capital.  The fluctuations in equity suggest inconsistent financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian's performance is significantly below market expectations, as evidenced by its negative cumulative return, negative alpha, and consistently negative EPS. While some technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, the extremely negative projected return, volatile financials, and persistent losses cast significant doubt on the long-term prospects of the company.  Further investigation into the reasons for the substantial underperformance and the assumptions behind the -71% expected return are crucial before making any investment decisions. The data suggests high risk.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution.  The duplicated data entry and the volatile nature of the data warrant a more thorough review of the data source and potentially further investigation into Rivian's business operations.
