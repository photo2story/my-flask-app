|------------|--------|-------|--------|-------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | 31.0%  | 77.7% | -32.0% | -0.0  | 16.6   |

*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the excess return of an investment compared to a benchmark (in this case, presumably the S&P 500), after accounting for risk.
    *   *2021-2023:* A positive alpha of 12.0% indicates that Rivian outperformed the benchmark during this period, even considering its risk (Beta).
    *   *2022-2024:* A negative alpha of -9.0% suggests Rivian underperformed the benchmark during this period, relative to its risk.
    *   *2023-2025:* A significantly negative alpha of -32.0% indicates substantial underperformance compared to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the volatility of an investment relative to the market. A beta of 1 indicates that the investment's price will move with the market. A beta greater than 1 suggests the investment is more volatile than the market, and a beta less than 1 suggests it is less volatile.
    *   *2021-2023:* A beta of 1.2 suggests that Rivian was more volatile than the market during this period.  Its price tended to move 1.2 times as much as the market.
    *   *2022-2024:* A beta of 0.1 indicates that Rivian was significantly less volatile than the market.
    *   *2023-2025:* A beta close to -0.0 suggests almost no correlation to the market.

**Summary of Alpha and Beta Analysis**

The data reveals that Rivian's performance relative to the market has been highly variable over the observed periods. Initially, it showed outperformance (positive Alpha) with higher volatility (Beta > 1). However, more recently, it has shown substantial underperformance (negative Alpha) and either low or negative correlation with the market (Beta near 0 or negative).  This suggests Rivian's stock price is increasingly driven by company-specific factors rather than broader market trends.
