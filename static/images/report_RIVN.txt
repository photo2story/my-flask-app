* **Cumulative Return (RIVN):** -24.57%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 33.23%

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows consistent negative EPS and relatively stable, though slightly declining, revenue.  This is a major concern and supports the negative expected return.  Further analysis requires more detailed financial statements.

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue      |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08   | $0.87 B      |
| 2024-08-06 | -$1.46   | $1.16 B      |

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a complete financial analysis.  This lack of data is a significant obstacle to comprehensive evaluation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian Automotive is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, showing consistent negative alpha and high volatility. While recent price action shows a short-term upward trend, technical indicators suggest caution.  The consistently negative EPS and lack of key financial data raise serious concerns about the company's long-term viability. The projected -70.9% expected return reinforces the substantial risk associated with investing in RIVN.  Further investigation into the company's financial statements and future projections is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The current data paints a bleak picture for RIVN's future performance relative to the market.
