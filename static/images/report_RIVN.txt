## Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Rivian Automotive Inc. is an American electric vehicle maker and manufacturer of electric trucks, SUVs, and delivery vans.

* **Cumulative Return (RIVN):** -35.27%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 30.66%
* **Return Difference (RIVN vs. VOO):** -65.9% (relative to historical range of -79.3% to 20.8%, at the 13.4th percentile)


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Rivian has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  The -65.9% difference highlights substantial underperformance. The provided alpha values of 0.0 suggest that Rivian's performance isn't significantly deviating from the market's overall movement (as measured by the Beta). However,  the negative alpha in conjunction with the substantial underperformance indicates substantial risk relative to market returns.  The beta values show high market sensitivity, implying that Rivian's stock price is highly correlated with and swings more wildly than the market, as demonstrated by the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values.  Capitalization has decreased during this time as well.  This should be considered highly risky.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 12.0% | 0.0 | 23.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -18.0% | 0.0 | 13.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 17.0% | 31.7% | -44.0% | 0.0 | 12.8 |



**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.56
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.66

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, and considerably below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend.  The small positive daily change (+$0.3996) from the previous close is minimal compared to the longer-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 35.63 (Below 50, suggesting bearish sentiment)
* **PPO:** -1.42 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +1.2 (Suggests recent short-term upward movement, but this is minor relative to the long term trend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -125.4% (This extremely negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 implies significant risk and potential for substantial losses over the long term).  This should be viewed as highly concerning.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistently negative EPS, indicating Rivian is currently operating at a loss. While revenue has fluctuated, there's no clear upward trend. The duplicated entry for 2024-11-07 needs clarification.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -1.08  | $0.87 B     |
| 2024-08-06 | -1.46  | $1.16 B     |

**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability are negative, and consistently so.  While revenue numbers are relatively stable (except for a slight dip in Q3 2024), the negative profit margins are alarming, and indicate that the company is not yet profitable. Similarly, the equity is declining, and the ROE (Return on Equity) is negative, highlighting significant financial challenges.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.87B | -44.85% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.16B | -38.95% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.20B | -43.77% |
| 2023-12-31 | $1.31B | -46.08% |
| 2023-09-30 | $1.34B | -35.68% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $5.90B | -18.65% |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.82B | -21.37% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | -17.92% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.14B | -16.64% |
| 2023-09-30 | $10.55B | -12.95% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian's performance is currently highly concerning.  The company is operating at a significant loss, consistently underperforming the market, exhibiting high volatility, and facing negative financial indicators across the board. The projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is deeply negative.  While there may be potential for future growth, the current data suggests considerable risk and a high probability of further losses.  This is not a recommendation to buy, and this stock should be considered highly risky.  Further due diligence and caution are strongly advised before any investment.
