**Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) Analysis**

**Company Overview:** Rivian Automotive Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and accessories.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **RIVN Cumulative Return:** -21.68%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 36.17%
*   **Divergence:** -58.5%
*   **Relative Divergence:** 14.2% (This indicates that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.)

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | -2.0%   | 76.0% | -4.0%   | 0.5  | 28.5   |
| 2022-2024  | 20.0%   | 76.0% | -6.0%   | 0.4  | 16.1   |
| 2023-2025  | 31.0%   | 76.0% | -23.0%  | 0.2  | 16.3   |

**Analysis:**

*   Rivian's cumulative return significantly underperforms the S&P 500. The divergence of -58.5% highlights this underperformance.
*   The relative divergence of 14.2% suggests that while the underperformance is substantial, it's near the lower end of the historical divergence range.
*   **Alpha:** Negative alpha values across all periods indicate Rivian has underperformed its benchmark after accounting for market risk (beta).
*   **Beta:** Beta values consistently below 1 suggest that Rivian's price is less volatile than the overall market (S&P 500).  However, the negative alpha indicates that even with lower volatility, Rivian has not delivered superior returns relative to the risk taken.
*   **CAGR:** The improving CAGR over the later periods (20.0% and 31.0%) could suggest improving performance, but the high MDD and negative alpha need to be considered.
*   **MDD:** The consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 76.0% across all periods demonstrates significant risk and volatility in Rivian's stock price.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Previous Close:** $13.97
*   **Change:** -3.65%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 13.85

*   **60-day Moving Average:** 13.16

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downward trend.
*   The price is slightly above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a possible consolidation or a weak uptrend in the medium term.
*   The significant price drop of -3.65% reflects a notable negative market reaction (potentially due to the news events - recalls, Amazon testing GM vans).

**3. Technical Indicators & Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3233 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 54.13 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.12 (Slightly positive momentum)

*   **Expected Return (%):** -211.0 (Indicates significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a low level of overall market risk at the moment, but this doesn't necessarily mitigate company-specific risks for Rivian.
*   The RSI is neutral, not providing a clear buy or sell signal.
*   The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days points to recent underperformance.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" suggesting buying 80% of cash indicates a cautiously optimistic outlook, potentially based on the low MRI.
*   **Important:** The very negative expected return of -211.0% suggests significant risk of underperformance over a longer-term investment horizon (2+ years), relative to the S&P 500.  This is a critical warning signal.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Recalls:**  Multiple news articles highlight a recall of 24,000 EVs due to a highway assist glitch. This is a significant negative event that likely impacted investor confidence.

*   **Analyst Opinions:** Analyst opinions are leaning towards hold, with an average price target slightly above the current price.
*   **Market Reaction:** Stock dropped today (Motley Fool)

**Analysis:**

*   The recall is a major concern, impacting brand reputation and potentially increasing costs.
*   Amazon's evaluation of GM's electric vans raises questions about the future of the Rivian-Amazon partnership and adds competitive pressure.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Profit Margin:** Profit margins have been highly variable, with some quarters showing negative margins. Achieving consistent profitability is a key challenge.
*   **Equity:** Equity has remained relatively stable, but the ROE is consistently negative. The negative ROE signifies that the company is not generating profits from its equity base.

**7. Overall Assessment**

Rivian faces significant challenges and risks:

*   **Underperformance:** It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and is projected to continue to do so.
*   **Profitability:** Consistent lack of profitability and volatile profit margins are major concerns.
*   **Competition:** Increasing competition in the EV market (as highlighted by Amazon's testing of GM vans) poses a threat.
*   **Negative Events:** Recalls and other negative news events can erode investor confidence.
*   **Financials:** Negative EPS and negative ROE highlight the company's lack of profitability.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the data provided, a *cautious* approach is warranted. The negative expected return, combined with recent negative news and inconsistent profitability, raises serious concerns. While there are some positive signals (potential revenue growth, low market risk), the overall risk profile is elevated. Further monitoring of Rivian's progress toward profitability, its ability to manage recalls effectively, and its competitive positioning within the EV market is essential before considering a long-term investment.
