**7. Overall Analysis:**

RIVN's performance is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500.  While short-term technical indicators show upward momentum, the extremely overbought RSI suggests a correction is likely.

Further investigation into the company's future prospects and market conditions is strongly advised before making any investment decisions.
