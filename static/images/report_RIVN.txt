## Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Rivian Automotive Inc. is an American electric vehicle (EV) maker.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the past period, exhibiting high volatility and negative returns. While recent price action shows a slight recovery,  fundamental analysis reveals ongoing financial challenges requiring close monitoring.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Rivian (RIVN) has accumulated a loss of -35.98% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO)'s gain of 15.73% resulting in a significant performance gap of -51.7%.  This places RIVN at the 23.6th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (where the minimum difference is -74.2% and maximum is 21.3%).

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance across the periods:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -4.0% | 42.5% | 1.0% | -0.0 | 26.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 8.0% | 42.5% | -25.0% | 0.0 | 15.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 6.0% | 33.2% | -40.0% | 0.0 | 13.1 |

The negative CAGR and significant maximum drawdown (MDD) highlight the considerable risk associated with investing in RIVN.  The volatile alpha suggests inconsistent outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The shrinking market capitalization also indicates market concerns about the company's prospects.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $11.60
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $11.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $11.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.72

The recent price of $11.60 represents a 6.62% increase from the previous close. The price is slightly below the 5 and 20-day moving averages, but significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent upward trend but still below longer-term averages.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 51.13 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.70 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +1.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -50.5% (Significant negative expected return, compared to S&P 500 over the long term)

The recent price jump (6.62%) indicates a potential short-term upward trend. However, the negative expected return of -50.5% highlights substantial risk, especially considering the long-term outlook against the S&P 500.  The relatively neutral RSI and positive PPO suggest some momentum, but caution is warranted due to the negative expected return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08  | $0.87 B      |
| 2024-08-06 | -$1.46  | $1.16 B      |
| 2024-05-07 | -$1.48  | $1.20 B      |
| 2023-11-07 | -$1.44  | $1.34 B      |
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.44  | $1.34 B      | *(Duplicate entry)*


Rivian continues to report significant losses despite relatively consistent revenue.  There's a need for further investigation into the reasons behind the fluctuating revenue and persistent negative EPS. The duplicate entry for 2024-11-07 requires clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.73B | 9.80%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.87B | -44.85%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.16B | -38.95%      |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.20B | -43.77%      |
| 2023-12-31 | $1.31B | -46.08%      |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE       |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $6.56B | -11.33%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $5.90B | -18.65%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.82B | -21.37%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | -17.92%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.14B | -16.64%   |


The financial data reveals significant volatility and consistent negative profitability. While Q4 2024 shows a positive profit margin, this needs to be assessed in light of the substantial losses across other quarters.  The negative ROE consistently shows that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian is a high-risk investment.  While the recent price increase and positive momentum indicators offer a glimmer of hope, the fundamental data paints a picture of a company struggling with profitability and facing significant challenges.  The large negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 underlines this risk.  Investors should carefully consider the persistent losses, high volatility, and the uncertainty surrounding the company's long-term growth prospects before investing.  Further due diligence is necessary to assess the sustainability of the recent price increase and the long-term viability of the company.  This review highlights considerable risk, and a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy should incorporate a higher risk tolerance and diversification.
