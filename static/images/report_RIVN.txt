* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided data suggests no expected excess return relative to the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment.  This aligns with the historical underperformance demonstrated by the cumulative return and CAGR.  A more comprehensive analysis would be needed to provide a reliable prediction.
* **Price Movement Consideration:** The slight increase from the last market close ($12.19) to the current close ($12.22) does not represent a significant or rapid change. No "rapid increase" or "rapid decrease" is observed.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data reveals a consistent trend of negative EPS and fluctuating revenue.  While revenue was higher in Q1 and Q2 2024 compared to Q3 2024,  all quarters show substantial losses.  There's no information to compare these results against expectations, thus "beats" or "misses" cannot be determined.  The company has not reached profitability in the observed period.  Revenue growth shows inconsistency, requiring further analysis for a definitive trend determination.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability tables show that Rivian has been consistently unprofitable. While revenue fluctuates, profit margins remain significantly negative.  Equity has decreased, reflecting the company's losses and indicating negative Return on Equity (ROE). The trend across these quarters points to a company struggling to generate profit and manage its capital effectively.

While recent price movement shows a minor upward trend, significant risks remain given the company's ongoing financial struggles.
