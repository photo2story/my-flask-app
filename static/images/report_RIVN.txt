The difference is -59.7%, placing it at the 19.6th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (-79.3% to 20.8%).

The high RSI value, coupled with a positive PPO, signals a potentially unsustainable price increase. The short-term upward momentum, however, might be short-lived considering the overbought condition.
