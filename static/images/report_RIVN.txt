**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Rivian Automotive Inc is an American electric vehicle maker.  Over the period reviewed, RIVN significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of -35.45% compared to the S&P 500's 14.11%.  This represents a considerable -49.6% difference.  The relative divergence of 31.0% indicates this underperformance is substantial, but not unprecedented relative to historical performance against the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR data shows inconsistent performance, with negative CAGR in the initial period and positive, but still low CAGR afterwards.  High Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight significant periods of loss.  The consistently near-zero alpha suggests RIVN has not outperformed the market after adjusting for beta, and the high beta indicates that RIVN is significantly more volatile than the broader market.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -2.0% | 76.0% | -17.0% | 26.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 20.0% | 76.0% | -6.0% | 15.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 17.0% | 76.0% | -0.1 | 13.7 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.09
* **5-day Moving Average:** $11.60
* **20-day Moving Average:** $11.83
* **60-day Moving Average:** $11.98

The price is slightly above the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent price increase.  The 2.46% daily change indicates a recent modest upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 56.06 (slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.27 (positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.3% (short-term downward trend)
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **Expected Return:** -80.0% (This extremely negative projected return warrants further investigation into the underlying assumptions)

The recent price increase (2.46%) is notable and should be further investigated to identify the factors behind this change.  The significantly negative long-term expected return (-80%) is a major concern and demands closer examination of the model used to generate this figure.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian's stock performance has been significantly underwhelming compared to the broader market.  While recent price action shows a slight positive trend, fundamental analysis reveals consistent losses, inconsistent revenue growth, and substantial negative long-term expected returns. The high beta suggests substantial volatility.  Further investigation is crucial to understand the reasons behind the recent price increase and to validate the extremely pessimistic long-term outlook.  The provided data reveals serious challenges for Rivian's financial health and sustainability, and significant risks exist for investors.  Careful consideration of all data, including clarifying inconsistencies and scrutinizing the -80% long-term projected return, is necessary before any investment decision.
