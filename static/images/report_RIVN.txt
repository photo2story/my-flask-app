**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, however, this should be viewed cautiously in light of other indicators. The RSI is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The negative PPO suggests a downward trend. The hybrid signal recommends buying, but the negative expected return indicates potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the long term. The short-term decrease in relative divergence reinforces the potential for further short-term decline.
The change of -0.44% from the previous close may not be a significant issue.
