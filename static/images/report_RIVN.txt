Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) is an American electric vehicle maker.  The company's stock performance significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price movements indicate some upward momentum, but key financial metrics suggest ongoing challenges.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **RIVN Cumulative Return:** -27.59%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 17.51%
* **Return Difference:** -45.1%

The table below shows a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta, and market capitalization (Cap) for different periods:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -2.0% | 76.0% | -17.0% | 28.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 20.0% | 76.0% | -6.0% | 15.9 |
| 2023-2025  | 25.0% | 76.0% | -0.1 | 16.4 |

**Analysis:**  RIVN has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  Negative alpha values suggest underperformance compared to the market benchmark, even considering its beta (market risk exposure).  The high MDD indicates substantial price volatility and risk. The fluctuating beta shows changing sensitivity to market movements over time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.68
* **Last Market Price:** $14.26 (4.24% increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $12.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.11

**Analysis:** The recent price increase (4.24%) is notable and surpasses the short-term moving averages.  This suggests a potential short-term upward trend, although it needs further confirmation.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 69.99 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.73 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.4 (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -61.8% (significantly lower than the S&P 500)

**Analysis:** While the PPO suggests bullish momentum and the recent price increase is positive, the RSI nearing overbought territory and the negative relative divergence indicate potential for a price correction.  The extremely negative expected return highlights the significant risk associated with long-term investment in RIVN compared to the S&P 500. The significant price jump needs monitoring for a possible short-lived rally or a sustained change of trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2025-05-06 | -$0.48   | $1.24B      |
| 2024-11-07 | -$1.08   | $0.87B      |
| 2024-08-06 | -$1.46   | $1.16B      |
| 2024-05-07 | -$1.48   | $1.20B      |
| 2024-05-06 | -$1.48   | $1.20B      | *(Duplicate entry - Likely an error in data)*

**Analysis:** Rivian is currently unprofitable, with consistent negative EPS.  Revenue fluctuates but doesn't show a clear upward trend.  The duplicated entry requires clarification.  Further investigation into the consistency and accuracy of the earnings data is essential.


**5. Financial Information:**

| 2024-12-31 | $1.73B | 9.80% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.87B | -44.85% |

| 2024-09-30 | $5.90B | -18.65% |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.82B | -21.37% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.07B | -17.92% |

**Analysis:** While revenue shows some growth in recent quarters, the company's profit margins remain largely negative.  The negative ROE indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity.  Profitability is a major concern for long-term sustainability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian Automotive is facing significant challenges.  While recent price movements suggest some short-term bullishness, the company's fundamental performance is weak, characterized by consistent losses, negative profit margins, and substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  The high risk associated with RIVN, as indicated by its historical volatility and negative expected return, should be carefully considered before investment.  Further investigation into the accuracy of the data provided, along with a detailed analysis of the company's long-term strategy and market positioning, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The recent price increase warrants close monitoring for confirmation of a sustained trend reversal.
