The relative divergence of 37.6% suggests this underperformance is notable compared to its historical volatility against VOO.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows inconsistent performance over the observed periods. While some periods show positive growth, the overall picture reflects underperformance. The Beta values indicate high sensitivity to market movements (generally above 1).  The negative alpha in 2023-2025 further underlines the underperformance relative to the market.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -2.0% | 76.0% | -17.0% | 26.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 20.0% | 76.0% | -6.0% | 15.2 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.83
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $12.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.06

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates a recent price surge.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 77.19 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 2.04 (Positive value indicates bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk)
* **Expected Return:** -59.9% (This indicates a significant potential loss over a long-term investment horizon relative to S&P 500).


The positive change in the 20-day relative divergence and the positive PPO value support the recent price increase. However, the overbought RSI level and significantly negative expected return raise concerns. The recent price increase (0.51 change) reflects a potential short-term bullish signal, but the longer-term outlook is extremely negative against the S&P 500.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian Automotive shows significant short-term upward momentum, reflected in its recent price increase and positive PPO value. However, the company's long-term prospects remain uncertain.  The consistently negative EPS, negative ROE, highly volatile profit margins and extremely negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 highlight substantial financial risks.  The overbought RSI suggests a potential correction is imminent.  While the recent price increase is encouraging,  investors should proceed with caution given the considerable financial challenges and significant underperformance relative to the market.  A long-term investment in RIVN carries substantial risk, given the current financial picture and significant market underperformance.  Further analysis into the companyâ€™s long-term growth strategy and its ability to achieve profitability is crucial before considering any investment.
