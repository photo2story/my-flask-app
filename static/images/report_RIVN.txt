*   The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a mixed picture. While the 2021-2023 period shows positive Alpha, indicating outperformance relative to market risk, the subsequent periods (2022-2024 and 2023-2025) show negative Alpha. This suggests recent underperformance not explained by overall market movements. The Beta values fluctuate, indicating varying degrees of correlation with the market.
*   High MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values across all periods highlight the high volatility and risk associated with RIVN.

*   **RSI:** 56.35
*   **PPO:** -0.3042

*   **Expected Return:** -67.4% (Long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500 if investing now)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.9 suggests a generally favorable market environment but should be tempered by the specific risks associated with RIVN.
*   An RSI of 56.35 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   The negative PPO (-0.3042) suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a downward trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, but this recommendation is qualified by the very safe classification and relies heavily on the high MRI score, which may not be indicative of RIVN's individual risk.
*   The negative change in relative divergence (-10.2) confirms the recent underperformance against the S&P 500.
*   The very negative expected return (-67.4%) is a significant red flag. This indicates that, based on current trends and analysis, RIVN is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon. This is a crucial consideration for potential investors.
*   The large negative change of -7.39% signals potential large volatility issues.
