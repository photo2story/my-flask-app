2025-12-20 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Rivian Automotive Inc. (RIVN) based on the data provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Company Overview:** Rivian Automotive Inc. is an American electric vehicle manufacturer focused on producing electric trucks and SUVs.
*   **RIVN Cumulative Return:** 41.24%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 36.66%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: -23.0
    *   Relative Divergence: 39.9

    **Analysis:** Rivian has outperformed the S&P 500 in cumulative return over the period. The negative current divergence simply means it has not performed within the historic minimum and maximum fluctuation range of the data (past data between min: -57.0, max: 28.2). The relative divergence of 39.9 indicates that Rivian's current divergence compared to the S&P 500 is in the lower percentile of its historical divergence range. This suggests that while Rivian has outperformed, it is currently not at its peak outperformance relative to the index.
