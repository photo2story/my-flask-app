*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.

*   **60-day SMA:** 14.56

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently trading above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which *could* indicate a short-term upward trend. However, the change in price on the last market day indicates a slight decrease, suggesting some volatility.

**3) RSI, PPO, Market Risk Indicator, Hybrid Signal, Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 50.07 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 1.04 (Potentially Bullish)

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 5.5 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -36.5% (Long-term)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A "Medium Investment" rating suggests a moderate level of risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI around 50 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests a potential upward trend in price momentum, but it is best used in conjunction with other indicators.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This suggests an aggressive buying strategy based on a model suggesting strong safety (high MRI). It recommends deploying all available cash and continuing to invest a small portion each month.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward movement relative to its historical underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** A negative expected return (-36.5%) is concerning. This indicates the model projects Rivian to underperform significantly compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.
*   **Fluctuation Consideration:** The provided market data (price, previous close, change) needs to be constantly monitored to respond effectively to sharp increases or declines.

Positive margins are seen in some quarters (2025-09-30, 2025-03-31, 2024-12-31), while others show losses. This suggests the company is struggling to consistently generate profits from its sales.
*   **Equity:**  Equity is decreasing.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, further reinforcing the lack of profitability. The decreasing equity coupled with negative ROE is concerning.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Rivian presents a mixed investment picture:

*   **Underperformance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and has a negative expected return over the long term.
*   **Volatility:** High Maximum Drawdown and fluctuating price action indicate high volatility.
*   **Mixed Signals:**  Recent price action is mixed (SMA above current price, recent price decreases). RSI is neutral, while the PPO and recent relative divergence changes suggest some potential upward momentum. The hybrid signal suggests a buying opportunity.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts are generally neutral ("Hold" rating) with a target price slightly below the current trading price, indicating a potential downside.
*   **Financials:** Revenue is generally increasing, but profitability is inconsistent and ROE is negative. Decreasing equity is also a concern.
*   **News:** News headlines are mixed, with both positive and cautious outlooks from analysts.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in Rivian is highly speculative. While the company is showing revenue growth, consistent profitability remains a challenge. Investors should be aware of the high volatility and the potential for further underperformance compared to the broader market. Further, the long-term negative expected return is particularly worrisome. The recent positive signals might suggest a short-term trade, but the fundamentals and long-term prospects need careful consideration.
