**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Rivian has recently outperformed the S&P 500, but faces both opportunities and challenges. The stock shows a recent upward trend, as indicated by moving averages and relative divergence. Positive news highlights the company's innovation and future potential with the R2 model and AI developments. However, concerns about Rivian's financial stability, need for capital, and negative profitability metrics (EPS, ROE, fluctuating profit margins) remain significant.

Analysts have a neutral "Hold" rating, and the RSI indicates the stock is approaching overbought conditions. The negative expected return suggests caution.

**Overall:** Rivian presents a high-risk, high-reward investment. The company's long-term success hinges on its ability to scale production efficiently, achieve profitability, and secure additional funding if needed. While recent stock performance and positive news are encouraging, investors should carefully weigh the financial risks and analyst sentiment before making a decision. The fluctuating Beta values suggest that the company is becoming increasingly uncorrelated to the broader market, and its price volatility can impact investment decisions.
