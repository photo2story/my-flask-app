**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Rivian Automotive Inc (RIVN) is an American electric vehicle (EV) maker.  As of the last data point, RIVN's cumulative return is -35.99%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 30.70%.  This represents a significant divergence of -66.7 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -66.7% places RIVN in the 12.6th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests considerable underperformance compared to the broader market.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures show a positive trend, but this is likely influenced by the relatively short observation period and doesn't compensate for significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values ranging from 31.7% to 45%. The alpha consistently shows zero indicating that the stock's performance hasn't outperformed the market benchmark based on this metric alone. The high beta (12.7 - 23.9) demonstrates high volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The market cap decreased significantly from 23.9 Billion in 2021-2023 to 12.7 Billion in 2023-2025 suggesting declining investor confidence.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 0.0 | 23.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -18.0% | 13.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 16.0% | 31.7% | -45.0% | 12.7 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $12.42
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $12.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $13.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $12.58

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-to-medium-term trend.  The recent price decline of $0.29 (-2.28%) shows a clear negative momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 26.79 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce, though not necessarily a reversal of the larger downtrend.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.75 – A negative value signals bearish momentum.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.3 (+) – A positive value shows a recent increase in relative divergence suggesting short-term upward momentum. This needs to be considered against the longer-term downtrend.

* **Expected Return:** -134.3% – This extremely negative projected return against the S&P 500 highlights considerable risk.  This implies substantial potential losses if the current trends persist.  The significant negative return suggests that the current market price does not reflect a promising long-term investment opportunity. The 2-year projection is extremely pessimistic and needs to be looked at critically.

Given the recent price drop (-2.28%), this reinforces the bearish trend.

Further research into the company's strategic plans, product pipeline and competitive landscape is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
