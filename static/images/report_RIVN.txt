**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Rivian Automotive Inc is an American electric vehicle maker.  Over the period reviewed, RIVN significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of -39.4% compared to VOO's 23.6%. This represents a considerable -63.0% difference.  The relative underperformance of 16.3% indicates that this level of underperformance is relatively low compared to the historical range of underperformance against VOO.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), Maximum Drawdown (MDD), Alpha, Beta, and market capitalization data show inconsistent performance and significant risk.  The negative alpha values across all periods suggest underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The high MDD figures indicate considerable price volatility and potential for significant losses. Beta values around 0 show low correlation to the market.  Note that the market capitalization shrinks significantly from year to year.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 36.7% | 12.0% | 0.0 | 26.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 15.0% | 36.7% | -18.0% | 0.0 | 15.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 12.0% | 31.7% | -41.0% | -0.0 | 13.1 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $11.60
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $11.88
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $12.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $13.31

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase from $11.4 to $11.6 is a small positive change, insufficient to signal a trend reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.94 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -1.48 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.3 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -102.7% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further clarification of methodology and assumptions.  It should be viewed with significant skepticism.)

The price change from the previous close suggests a minor positive movement, not a significant bounce or crash. The negative PPO and relative divergence confirm the bearish momentum. The extremely low expected return of -102.7% compared to the S&P 500 should be considered carefully.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows consistent negative EPS and relatively flat revenue. This is not a positive sign for investors.  There is a repeated entry for 2024-11-07, which seems to be an error in the data provided.

**5. Financial Information:**

Equity has fluctuated, but ROE (Return on Equity) remains negative across all reported quarters. This points to a company struggling with profitability and potentially facing financial challenges.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Rivian is currently experiencing significant challenges.  The company's stock has substantially underperformed the market, showing consistent negative EPS, negative profit margins, and negative ROE.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  While the RSI is approaching oversold levels,  this alone is insufficient to suggest a reversal. The extremely negative long-term expected return should be treated with caution, requiring scrutiny of the underlying methodology and assumptions used to arrive at that number.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering any investment in RIVN.  The company needs to demonstrate significant improvements in profitability and operational efficiency to regain investor confidence.
