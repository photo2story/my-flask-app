**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha and beta data are inconsistent and unreliable as the beta is constantly zero.  While the CAGR fluctuates, the consistent MDD of 36.7% suggests high volatility.  Further investigation into these metrics is needed for a robust analysis.

Short-term momentum appears positive with the 5-day and 20-day moving averages above the 60-day moving average ($14.47, $12.50, and $11.18, respectively).  This indicates a potential upward trend in the short term.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 74.12 suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory, signaling a potential pullback.  A PPO of 1.85 confirms positive momentum. The positive change in relative divergence over the last 20 days (+2.8) further reinforces this short-term bullish sentiment.  However, the 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests a less optimistic long-term outlook.

**7. Overall Analysis Summary:**

Rivian is facing significant challenges. While short-term price momentum appears positive based on moving averages and technical indicators like RSI and PPO, the long-term outlook remains uncertain. Declining revenue, negative profitability, and dwindling equity raise serious concerns. The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 further highlights the risks.

The provided alpha/beta data needs further verification and analysis.
