## Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR), a company developing and manufacturing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While VOO showed a cumulative return of 61.47%, ACHR experienced a cumulative loss of -7.79%. This represents a substantial divergence of -69.26%, placing it at the 17.97th percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR figures further highlight the underperformance, ranging from -81.2% to -28.5% across different periods.  High betas (ranging from 0.7 to 2.4) indicate significant price volatility correlated with the overall market.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values further emphasize the substantial risk associated with this investment.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $4.41 (Last Market: $4.82)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $4.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $3.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $3.33

The price is currently above its 5-day moving average but significantly above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent price surge after a period of lower prices.  The drop from $4.82 to $4.41 might indicate a minor pullback after this surge.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 69.09 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.43 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +17.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates that the model does not predict any significant excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term investment, given the current information).


The RSI nearing overbought territory suggests potential short-term price correction. However, the positive PPO and the upward trend in relative divergence indicate bullish momentum. The recent price drop from $4.82 may not represent a significant 'crash', but it could be a minor correction or profit-taking after the price surge.

**4. Recent Earnings & Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent negative EPS, although the most recent EPS (-0.24) is slightly better than the expectation (-0.32). This suggests the company is still in a loss-making phase.  Further analysis is needed to determine if the trend is improving or worsening. The absence of revenue and gross profit data limits a comprehensive financial evaluation.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of crucial financial data such as Total Revenue and Gross Profit significantly hinders a thorough financial analysis of ACHR.  This lack of information makes any financial assessment unreliable.

**6. News & Recent Issues:**

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

ACHR shows considerable risk. While recent price action indicates short-term bullish momentum, the negative EPS, lack of key financial data, and significant underperformance against the S&P 500 raise serious concerns.  The high beta signifies considerable market sensitivity, meaning any negative market movement will likely impact ACHR disproportionately.  Before considering any investment, a comprehensive due diligence process is crucial, encompassing thorough financial analysis (once the missing data is obtained), and a detailed assessment of the company's long-term prospects in the eVTOL market.  The current information suggests a high-risk, high-reward scenario, unsuitable for risk-averse investors. The model's 0.0% expected return further suggests that, based on the available data, there is no expectation of outperforming the market in the long term.
