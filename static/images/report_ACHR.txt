## Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Archer Aviation Inc. (ACHR) based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Archer Aviation Inc. is an electric aircraft company developing and manufacturing electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft.

The cumulative return of ACHR is -7.79%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 61.47%.  The difference is a significant -69.26%.  The relative divergence of -17.97% indicates ACHR underperformed the S&P 500 considerably, falling within the lower 18% of its historical performance range relative to the index.

The provided CAGR data reveals consistently negative returns over the periods 2020-2022, 2021-2023, and 2022-2024. While the beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements, the consistently negative alpha suggests underperformance compared to the market benchmark.  High Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) reflect significant price drops.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $4.41
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $4.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $3.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $3.33

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, though the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day MA indicates a potential plateau or minor consolidation phase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (69.09):**  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term price correction.
* **PPO (2.43):** Positive, indicating upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+17.9):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend relative to the S&P 500.  

The current price of $4.41 doesn't necessarily indicate a significant event (like a sudden surge or drastic fall) given the context of the moving averages and the recent upward trend. However, the proximity to overbought territory on the RSI warrants caution.  The expected return is 0.0%, indicating no significant predicted excess return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), considering the historical performance and risk profile.  This long-term outlook should consider the inherent risks associated with an early-stage company in a developing market.

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows consistently negative EPS, with actual results often slightly worse than estimates. The most recent earnings report (2024-11-07) shows an EPS of -0.24 compared to an expected EPS of -0.32, a slight positive surprise.  However, this needs to be interpreted in the context of the company's overall financial situation and growth trajectory, which lacks revenue and gross profit data. This data alone does not sufficiently support a strong positive outlook.


**6. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data is a significant concern.  Without this crucial information, a comprehensive financial assessment is impossible. This lack of data severely limits the ability to assess the company's financial health and growth potential.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent News:** (Requires input.  Please provide any recent news articles, press releases, or analyst reports for a complete analysis.)  Lacking this data prevents meaningful analysis of recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights. I cannot provide information from sources like FINBOLD without specific details.  Analysis of any recent earnings news from Shacknews or similar sources needs to be supplied.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

ACHR significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed periods. While recent price action shows some upward momentum, technical indicators suggest potential short-term corrections.  The absence of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) makes a thorough financial evaluation impossible.  Consistently negative EPS and high MDD represent significant risks.  Positive surprises in recent earnings are not sufficient to overcome these issues.  A long-term (2+ years) investment should only be considered with a high risk tolerance and after a complete review of all available information, including missing financial data and recent news.  The currently provided data does not support a positive long-term investment recommendation.

A complete investment decision should involve a thorough due diligence process, including reviewing all financial statements, news articles, analyst reports, and conducting independent research.
