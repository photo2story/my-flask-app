While ACHR showed a cumulative return of 7.26%, VOO achieved a 62.29% return.

* **PPO (3.19):**  A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, although the high RSI suggests caution.

* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The projected return of 0.0% over the long term against the S&P 500 implies that given the current data, substantial risks are present.

The 0.0% figure likely represents a pessimistic view given the current market sentiment and high risk associated with this early-stage company.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS data reveals consistent negative earnings, although the most recent EPS (-0.24) was slightly better than the estimate (-0.32).  The company is clearly still in a loss-making phase, indicating substantial risk for investors. The consistent negative EPS figures highlight the company's ongoing challenges in achieving profitability.  Further investigation into revenue and gross profit figures (currently unavailable) is needed for a more comprehensive assessment.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of total revenue and gross profit data severely limits a complete financial analysis. Without this crucial information, a sound evaluation of ACHR's financial health and future prospects is impossible.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ACHR presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity. While the recent price movement shows a potential upward trend, the lack of profitability, overbought RSI, and significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 raise substantial concerns.  The absence of key financial data further hampers a comprehensive analysis.  Any investment decision should be made after thorough due diligence, considering the substantial risk associated with its pre-revenue stage and volatility.  The company's success hinges on the development and market acceptance of its eVTOL technology, a factor with significant uncertainty.  A long-term investment strategy requires a high tolerance for risk and a long time horizon.  Pending further information regarding revenue, gross profits, and current market sentiment,  it's difficult to make a definitive recommendation. The positive relative divergence over the last 20 days, while encouraging, should be interpreted cautiously given the broader context of the company's performance and financial health.
