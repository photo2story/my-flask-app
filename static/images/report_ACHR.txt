## Archer Aviation Inc (ACHR) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Archer Aviation Inc (ACHR) is an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft company.  Over the analyzed period, ACHR underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly.  While VOO showed a cumulative return of 60.55%, ACHR had a cumulative return of -14.06%. This represents a divergence of -74.61%, placing it in the 14.54th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR data from 2020-2024 shows consistently negative returns despite a relatively high beta (indicating significant market sensitivity) and positive alpha in the later periods (suggesting potential outperformance relative to the market, though this is not consistently shown).  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) highlights substantial risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $4.11
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $4.37
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $3.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $3.32

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The 5-day average being significantly higher than the 20- and 60-day averages indicates a recent decline.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (64.0):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning towards the overbought territory.
* **PPO (2.68):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+12.96):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend in relative performance.

The current price of $4.11, considering its position below moving averages and despite a positive PPO, doesn't signify a dramatic upswing or downswing.  The expected return is given as 0.0%, suggesting no significant projected outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) based on the provided data.  Further analysis would be needed to support this expectation.

**4. Recent Earnings & Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent negative EPS, consistently missing (though narrowing) estimates.  The most recent report (2024-11-07) shows an EPS of -0.24 against an estimate of -0.32, a positive surprise. However, this needs to be viewed in the context of consistently negative earnings and the overall market performance.

**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data is available, significantly hindering a comprehensive financial assessment.  This lack of fundamental data makes a robust valuation difficult.

**6. News & Recent Issues:**

**7.  Comprehensive Analysis:**

ACHR displays significant risk. While the recent positive EPS surprise (2024-11-07) and positive PPO signal potential short-term upside, it's crucial to consider the consistently negative earnings, the significant underperformance against the S&P 500, and the lack of fundamental data (revenue, gross profit). The bearish short-term price movement (below moving averages) adds to the cautionary outlook.  The high beta underscores the stock's volatility and susceptibility to market fluctuations.  A thorough evaluation necessitates access to recent news, analyst opinions, and a detailed financial analysis beyond the provided limited data.  Long-term investment requires a higher risk tolerance given the historical performance and current indicators.
