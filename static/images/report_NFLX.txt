*   **Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows a wide range of performance, from strong growth periods (2015-2018) to significant declines more recently (2018-2025). The negative CAGR in recent periods is concerning.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  High MDD values (consistently above 70%) suggest significant volatility and risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the stock's performance relative to the benchmark (S&P 500). Negative alpha values indicate underperformance relative to the benchmark. The most recent period has a very large negative alpha.
    *   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the benchmark. Beta values around 0.2-0.3 indicate lower volatility compared to the market, while those of 1.0 and 1.6 mean that the stock is more sensitive to market movements.
    *   **Cap(B):** Indicates Market Capitalization in Billions.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 94.47
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 94.47, 'previousClose': 93.64, 'change': 0.89}
*   **5-day SMA:** 93.846
*   **20-day SMA:** 97.3445
*   **60-day SMA:** 660.7287

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The recent closing price is slightly higher than the previous close, indicating a small gain.
    *   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, suggesting a short-term downtrend.
    *   The 60-day SMA is *extremely* high, indicating a likely data error.  This number is not realistic given the current price. *Assuming this is a data error* and disregarding it: The short-term downtrend is a key area of focus.

**3) Index Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 32.00 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** 2.60
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.1 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4778.7%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The **MRI** suggests high investment recommendation.
    *   **RSI** suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity *if* other factors align.
    *   **PPO:** Positive PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, which can be interpreted as an upward trend in momentum, even if only temporary.
    *   The **Hybrid Signal** recommends buying based on oversold conditions and the MRI (at a lower value than the current one).
    *   The negative relative divergence change confirms a short-term downward trend.
    *   The **Expected Return** is extraordinarily high. This is almost certainly a model output based on specific assumptions and should be viewed with extreme skepticism.

**Key Negatives & Risks:**

*   **High Volatility:** High Maximum Drawdown values indicate significant volatility and risk.
*   **Negative Alpha:**  The stock is underperforming the benchmark (S&P 500).
*   **Short-Term Downtrend:** Recent price action suggests a short-term downtrend.
*   **Data Errors:** Possible bad data reported on 60 day SMA and duplicate of a prior period's earnings results.
*   **Uncertainty:** Analyst target prices have a wide range, suggesting uncertainty about the company's future. News headlines reflect scrutiny regarding potential deals and ad-tier performance.

**Overall Assessment:**

Investing in Netflix appears risky. While there are positive signs of improvement in the company's financials and some indicators suggesting a potential short-term rebound, the historical underperformance, high volatility, and uncertainties surrounding its future make it a speculative investment. The extremely high "expected return" should be viewed with extreme skepticism. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and potential rewards before investing in Netflix, and conduct further research into the potential Warner Bros. Discovery deal and the performance of the ad-supported tier. Consider the high end-of-range MRI and consider if you trust the MRI as an indicator. The Hybrid Signal indicates buying with oversold conditions, but only *if* the MRI were closer to the 0.8 that it was trained for.
