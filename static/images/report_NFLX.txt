    | 2023-2025  | 165.0% | 81.5% | 97.0%  | 1.1  | 397.3  |

    *   **CAGR:**  Shows generally strong growth over the analyzed periods, though recent periods (2020-2023, 2021-2023) show negative growth. The most recent periods (2022-2024, 2023-2025) show strong growth again.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates significant risk.  The high drawdowns (75.7%-90.1%) mean the stock can experience large declines.
    *   **Alpha:**  The recent negative Alpha values (-33.0%, -37.0%) suggest underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in those periods, even when considering risk. The most recent values of 78.0% and 97.0% look more promising.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values range from 0.8 to 1.7, meaning NFLX's price is more volatile than the S&P 500 index itself.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization (in Billions) - Indicates the company's size and has generally increased over time, though decreased from 2019-2021 period to 2020-2022, reflecting a change in growth.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 93.76
*   **Last Market Change:** A slight decrease of -0.02 from the previous close.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 93.96
    *   20-day SMA: 95.548
    *   60-day SMA: 107.2475

    *Interpretation:* The short-term moving averages (5-day and 20-day) are below the 60-day SMA. The stock price is slightly below the 5-day average. This might suggest a short-term downward trend, however, further analysis of trend indicators like MACD may be beneficial.

**3) RSI, PPO Index, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended) - Indicates a relatively favorable investment environment.
*   **RSI:** 55.7 -  Neutral territory.  An RSI above 70 is generally considered overbought, while below 30 is oversold.
*   **PPO:** 0.43 - Measures the difference between two moving averages as a percentage of the longer moving average. A PPO of 0.43 suggests the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, which can indicate upward momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-24) - A strong buy signal, suggesting the stock is undervalued and poised for a rebound. The MRI score of 0.9 further supports this recommendation.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 1.2 (+) - Indicates a short-term upward trend in divergence (Netflix is improving relative to the S&P 500).
*   **Last Market Change:** The small change (-0.02) suggests no major immediate fluctuation.
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0% - The expected return is zero, suggesting the investment is expected to only keep pace with the market, and not offer excess returns.

*   **Performance:** Netflix has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, and the divergence remains negative. The historical Alpha/Beta analysis shows variable relative performance over the past years.
*   **Risk:** High MDD values indicate significant downside risk. The Beta values also indicate higher volatility than the overall market.
*   **Momentum:** Recent stock price action suggests a short-term downward trend, but the RSI is neutral. Recent Relative Divergence Change suggests Netflix's performance is improving relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Sentiment:** Analyst sentiment is generally positive, with a "Buy" consensus and a significant upside target price.
*   **Financials:** Revenue, EPS, and equity are generally trending upward, indicating growth. Profit margins remain healthy.
*   **News:** Recent news is a mixed bag, with positive analyst outlooks offset by external factors and potential regulatory concerns.
*   **Investment Recommendation:** The MRI of 0.9 suggests a "Medium Investment Recommended". The Hybrid Signal indicates a "Buy" (OverSold Boost). Analysts also provide "Buy" recommendation and anticipate an upside in 2026. However, the divergence, zero expected return, recent slight stock price decrease, and the fact that the short-term moving averages are below the 60-day average suggest caution. While the long-term prospects for Netflix seem positive, it's recommended to monitor trends in coming quarters.
