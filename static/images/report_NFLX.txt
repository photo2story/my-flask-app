## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Netflix Inc. (NFLX) is a leading global entertainment company providing streaming services.  The cumulative return of NFLX is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last day in the provided data is 226%, representing a substantial outperformance.  The relative divergence of 95% indicates NFLX's performance is in the top 95th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided alpha values consistently show outperformance against the market benchmark (S&P 500), especially noticeable in the periods between 2016 and 2020, although the recent years show significant negative alpha which offsets much of the gain.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $932.12
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $908.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $909.64
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $817.56

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, although the relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5 and 20 day moving averages implies a potentially short lived move.  The significant gap between the closing price and the 60-day moving average highlights a more substantial recent price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 56.49 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions).
* **PPO:** -0.61 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum).
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.2 (Short-term upward trend).
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 91.6% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is projected over the long term.  This is predicated on the historical data and extrapolates the alpha from the data set.  The significant swings in the CAGR over the years indicate that this number should be regarded with caution).

The current price of $932.12, while above recent moving averages, doesn't necessarily indicate a sudden surge or drop.  The relatively small difference between the price and the shorter moving averages warrants caution.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue Growth:** Generally increasing, with a minor dip between Q3 2023 and Q4 2023 before resuming growth.
* **EPS Trends:** Fluctuating, with a significant increase in Q4 2024 compared to Q3 2024 but also a decrease from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024.  There seems to be a significant discrepancy between the two entries for 10/18/2024.  There is insufficient information to reconcile this.
* **Notable Beats/Misses:**  Without analyst expectations, it's impossible to determine if results beat or missed expectations.  The data only shows reported numbers.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows consistent growth, while profit margins have been fluctuating, showing a notable drop in Q4 2023 but subsequently showing a strong recovery.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has generally increased, while ROE shows some volatility, with a considerable decline in Q4 2023 before recovering.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News:** The provided data includes the most recent earnings report, but additional news and context from other sources are necessary to complete a thorough analysis.
* **Market Outlook & Analyst Opinions:** This information is absent and critical to a complete assessment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NFLX has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the past, particularly notable from 2016 to 2020. However, recent years have seen negative alpha that may signal a longer term cyclical change. The recent price movement shows a short-term upward trend. Technical indicators are mixed but not overtly bullish or bearish. Earnings data show fluctuating but generally increasing revenue and EPS.  Financial data indicates growth in revenue and equity although profitability has seen volatility. The provided data is insufficient for a definitive conclusion. Missing information regarding analyst expectations, market outlook, and current news significantly limits the analysis.  A complete analysis requires additional information regarding the market environment and analyst sentiment.  The projected high return based solely on extrapolation of past alpha is inherently uncertain given the variability evident in the data.
