**6.  Overall Analysis:**

Netflix shows a strong long-term performance history with significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, the recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction, possibly related to market risk and negative momentum indicators. The high relative divergence, coupled with recent negative price movement and oversold RSI, might suggest a temporary pullback before a potential rebound.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent sharp decline is crucial.  Despite the short-term concerns, the long-term outlook, supported by healthy financial performance and a high expected return, remains relatively positive for long-term investors.  However, the high market risk should be carefully considered.  Clarification on the duplicate earnings data entry is needed for a more complete analysis.
