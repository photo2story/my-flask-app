## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Netflix Inc. is a leading global provider of streaming entertainment services.  The cumulative return of NFLX is 314.18%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.36%. The difference is 193.8%, placing it at the 84.4th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong historical outperformance, though past performance is not indicative of future results.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows variable performance across different time periods.  While periods like 2018-2020 and 2023-2025 exhibit exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), others, particularly 2020-2023, show significant negative returns.  The consistently low beta (around 0.1) suggests low correlation with the overall market, indicating a less volatile investment compared to the broader market.  However, the high maximum drawdown (MDD) in 2020-2023 highlights significant risk.  The alpha, while consistently positive, varies significantly.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2017-2019  | 88.0% | 42.0% | 56.0% | 0.1 | 372.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 150.0% | 42.0% | 117.0% | 0.1 | 372.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $869.68
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $849.36
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $880.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $857.48

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The 5-day moving average is significantly lower, indicating recent downward pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 36.37  (Suggests the stock is possibly oversold)
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.48 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +2.0 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 14.6% over the long term (2+ years)

The recent price change of approximately 1.35% is not considered a significant jump or drop.  The combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and positive short-term divergence suggests a potentially complex situation, needing further analysis.  The high long-term expected return is promising, but high risk should be considered, given the volatility shown in the historical data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue growth. While revenue has generally increased, EPS shows inconsistency, needing further investigation into the profitability drivers.  There is a duplicate entry for 2024-10-18.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NFLX has demonstrated significant historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but this has been accompanied by considerable volatility. While current financial indicators show positive revenue and profit margin trends, the recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potentially bearish short-term outlook.  The high long-term expected return is attractive, but investors should carefully consider the substantial risk associated with this stock, given the observed high maximum drawdowns in the past.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the causes of EPS fluctuation and a broader economic outlook, is necessary before making any investment decisions.
