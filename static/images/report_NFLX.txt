| 2023-2025  | -113.0%   | 90.4% | -178.0%  | 0.6 | 464.0   |

*   **CAGR:**  Highly volatile, ranging from -113% to +113%, indicating significant fluctuations in growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, suggesting significant risk and potential for substantial losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Fluctuating Alpha indicates varying performance relative to a benchmark. Negative Alpha in recent periods suggests underperformance. The most recent period, 2023-2025, shows a very negative Alpha (-178%), indicating a drastic underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta generally increased, reaching highs of 1.6.  A Beta greater than 1 suggests that the stock is more volatile than the market, while a Beta near 0 implies very low correlation with the market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 109.475
*   **Last-Market:** price: 109.47, previousClose: 109.13, change: 0.31. Small price increase from previous close.
*   **5-day SMA:** 106.913
*   **20-day SMA:** 612.7185
*   **60-day SMA:** 995.6073

*   **Analysis:**  The current price is above the 5-day SMA, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the price is significantly *below* both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This indicates that, despite the recent uptick, the stock is still trading significantly below its medium and long-term averages. The difference between the 5-day SMA and the 20-day/60-day SMAs is extreme, highlighting the magnitude of the recent decline.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 4.417 (Extremely Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -13.604 (Strongly Negative, Indicates Downward Momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90)"
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.7 (Negative - Indicates Short-Term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4589.5%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, BUT this should be viewed with caution considering the other indicators.
    *   The extremely low RSI (4.417) indicates the stock is heavily oversold, which *could* suggest a potential for a rebound.
    *   The highly negative PPO confirms strong downward momentum.
    *   The hybrid signal suggests buying 100% with cash, which is contradictory to the under performance of the stock.
    *   The negative change in relative divergence reinforces the short-term downward trend.
    *   The EXTREMELY high expected return (4589.5%) seems unrealistic and should be treated with extreme skepticism. It likely stems from the oversold condition and potential for a correction, but such a large return is highly unlikely.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Netflix is currently presenting a mixed picture:

*   **Negative Signals:**  Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative Alpha in recent periods, the stock is trading well below its 20 and 60 day SMAs, strong downward momentum (negative PPO), and recent decline relative divergence.
*   **Positive Signals:**  Oversold conditions (low RSI), recent revenue growth, and an increase in profit margins.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** High Market Risk Indicator, hybrid signal which are both contradictory to the current performance of the stock.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:**  While analysts have a consensus "Buy" rating, the wide target price range suggests uncertainty.

**Overall:**

Based on the data, a cautious approach is warranted. The stock appears oversold and *may* be due for a rebound. However, the strong downward momentum, underperformance relative to the market, and significant risks (high MDD, recent negative alpha) indicate that this is a high-risk investment. The projected 4589.5% return should be viewed as highly speculative.

**Recommendations:**

*   **Do Further Research:** This analysis is based on limited data. Conduct more in-depth research into Netflix's business prospects, competitive landscape, and financial health.
*   **Consider Risk Tolerance:**  Only invest if you are comfortable with a high level of risk and potential for substantial losses.
*   **Monitor Closely:**  If you decide to invest, monitor the stock price, technical indicators, and news flow closely for any changes in the overall picture.
