**6) Overall Analysis:**

Netflix exhibits a history of substantial volatility and periods of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500. While recent price action suggests a short-term downward trend, the long-term outlook, supported by strong financial performance and a projected high expected return, remains positive, particularly for investors with a long-term (2+ years) horizon. However, the high Beta highlights the inherent market risk associated with the stock.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the periods of underperformance and the recent price decline is warranted before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated earnings data needs to be resolved.
