2025-01-26 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Netflix Inc. (NFLX) based on the provided data, formatted as a report.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO)**

Netflix Inc. is a leading global entertainment company providing streaming services.

The cumulative return of NFLX is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 313.5%, placing it at the 99.1st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance.  However, the provided CAGR data shows significant volatility, ranging from a negative return (-128%) to a substantial positive return (273%) across different periods.  This underscores the risk associated with the stock.

**2. Recent Price Movement**

* **Closing Price:** $977.59
* **5-day Moving Average:** $928.84
* **20-day Moving Average:** $890.03
* **60-day Moving Average:** $868.44

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, although the negative change from the previous close (-0.74%) indicates a slight short-term dip.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 68.89  This suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory, potentially indicating a short-term pullback is possible.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.40 A positive PPO value suggests bullish momentum.

* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** +13.1% This confirms a short-term upward trend.

* **Expected Return:** 22.1%  This implies a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if the current trend holds.  However, this prediction needs to be viewed cautiously given the historical volatility.  The negative daily change of -0.74%  doesn't indicate a significant immediate downturn, but it's a minor adjustment and doesn't invalidate the expected return.
