**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $1049.59
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $1002.5
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $944.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $965.40

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  However, the relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates some consolidation might occur.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 65.97 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.61 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +9.7% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 23.9% (Significantly higher than the implied return of the VOO)

The price increase from the previous close (+$0.89) is relatively small and doesn't indicate a significant jump.  The high expected return suggests potential for outsized gains over the long term compared to the S&P 500, but this should be viewed in context of the high volatility demonstrated in the Alpha/Beta analysis.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix exhibits a strong long-term performance significantly exceeding the S&P 500. However, this performance is characterized by significant volatility.  Recent price action suggests a possible upward trend, supported by positive momentum indicators (PPO).  High expected returns are promising for long-term investors, but the inherent risk should be acknowledged given the historical volatility and the current RSI nearing overbought territory.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in the alpha and beta calculations, along with clarification on the duplicated earnings data point, is recommended.  The financial statements show consistent revenue growth and generally high profit margins and ROE.  A thorough risk assessment is crucial before investing, given the inherent volatility associated with Netflix's stock.
