2024-12-14 - Analysis Report
## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Netflix (NFLX) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The cumulative return for NFLX is 340.31%, while VOO's is 120.91%, resulting in a difference of 219.4%. This places NFLX at the 92.8th percentile of its historical relative performance against VOO.  Netflix is a global provider of streaming television and motion picture services.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows high volatility and varying performance.  While significant positive Alpha was recorded in several periods (reflecting outperformance relative to the market), this was followed by substantial negative returns in 2020-2023, indicating sensitivity to market shifts.  The Beta consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting lower sensitivity to overall market movements than a typical stock (beta of 1).  However, this is likely a consequence of the small timeframe examined. The consistent high CAGR figures in the pre-2020 data show that the company was highly profitable during this period.
