## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Report

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Netflix Inc. is a leading global entertainment company providing streaming services.

The cumulative return of NFLX is 300.18%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 112.47%.  The difference is 187.7%, placing it at the 82.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates NFLX has substantially outperformed the market over the analyzed period.  However, the provided alpha and beta analysis shows significant volatility, with periods of both extremely high returns and substantial losses.  This high beta (generally above 1.0) suggests high sensitivity to market fluctuations.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $840.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $862.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $896.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $848.19

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend or consolidation period.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (25.99):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce back. However, this should be considered in conjunction with other factors.
* **PPO (-1.21):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-5.1%):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (15.3%):**  This represents a projected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon. The high expected return should be cautiously viewed given the high volatility seen in the historical data.  Given the current price is below the moving averages and the negative PPO,  a significant bounce is possible before reaching the projected return.  This should not be treated as a guarantee.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NFLX has demonstrated significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term.  However, this performance has been highly volatile.  Recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, although oversold conditions (RSI) hint at a possible short-term rebound.  Strong revenue and profit margin growth are positive signs,  but the significant decline in ROE in Q4 2023 warrants further investigation. The high expected return should be viewed with caution given the historical volatility of the stock.  A comprehensive analysis requires understanding the reasons behind the Q4 2023 performance dip and considering macroeconomic factors.  Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough due diligence before investing.
