**1. Company Overview and Performance Analysis:**

Netflix Inc. is a leading global provider of streaming entertainment services.  The provided data shows a substantially higher cumulative return for NFLX compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The significant positive alpha values in most years (except 2020-2022 and 2021-2023) demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to the market (Beta >1 indicates higher volatility than the market). However, the high Beta also highlights substantial market risk. The recent negative CAGR in 2020-2023 shows significant volatility. The high market capitalization consistently increases over time.

However, the high RSI warns of potential overbought conditions.  Long-term investment prospects appear favorable given the high projected return relative to the market, but the high beta highlights the substantial risk associated with this stock.  Further investigation into the drivers of recent price volatility and future growth prospects is warranted before making investment decisions.
