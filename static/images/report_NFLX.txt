## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Netflix Inc. is a leading global entertainment company providing streaming services.  The cumulative return of NFLX is 308.67%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.37%. The difference is 190.3%, placing it at the 83.3rd percentile of its historical relative divergence to the S&P 500 (based on a min/max range of -64.1% to 241.3%).  While this suggests strong historical outperformance, it's crucial to remember past performance is not indicative of future results. The high alpha values (consistently around 0.1) in the provided data further support this outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  However, it is noteworthy that the company experienced significant negative CAGR in 2020-2023.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $858.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $843.48
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $881.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $855.72

The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend, despite recent positive CAGR.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 27.05 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -0.76 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.1 – This slight positive change hints at a short-term upward trend, but it's not conclusive.

The current price of $858.10 does not suggest any drastic recent changes (no signs of sharp upturns or downturns). The expected return of 15.1% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 indicates a potentially attractive investment opportunity, but this is a forecast and not guaranteed.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix demonstrates strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, supported by high alpha values.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term bearish trend.  While the stock is currently in oversold territory (RSI), the negative PPO and the price being below its moving averages warrant caution.  The company's financial health appears sound, with increasing revenue and generally strong profit margins.  The long-term projected outperformance against the S&P 500 is positive.  Further investigation into the duplicate entry in the earnings data and a thorough examination of the company's future growth prospects are necessary before making any investment decisions.  The oversold condition might present a buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high-risk tolerance, but careful consideration of the current market sentiment and potential risks is crucial.
