The most recent quarter (2024-Q3) shows a slight decrease in EPS compared to 2024-Q1, but revenue continues to increase.  There's no information provided to compare against expectations, so it's impossible to determine whether these numbers represent beats or misses.  Notably, there's a duplicate entry for October 18th, 2024.  This needs clarification.  Assuming it is an error and there is only one entry, we see substantial revenue growth over the past year.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent issues are provided in the prompt.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix shows strong long-term growth potential, as evidenced by its significant outperformance against the S&P 500 and a projected 13.4% higher return over the next couple of years.  However, current technical indicators suggest a short-term downward trend.  The recent earnings show continued revenue growth and generally strong profitability, with some quarterly variation.  The relatively low RSI and negative PPO indicate oversold conditions, suggesting a potential short-term bounce is possible.  Long-term investors may see this as a potentially attractive entry point, provided the company can maintain its revenue growth and profit margins.  More information is needed to fully assess the recent earnings performance relative to market expectations and to fully understand the duplicate entry in the earnings data.  News and analyst opinions would also provide a more complete picture of the current market outlook for the company.
