**8. Overall Analysis:**

NFLX has demonstrated exceptional historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, the current RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, implying a potential near-term correction.  While recent financial results are positive, the substantial volatility highlighted by the MDD and the varying CAGR figures warrant careful consideration.  The high Beta indicates significant market correlation.  A long-term investment perspective, balanced with risk management, is crucial. The expected excess return of 2.6% over the S&P 500 over the next two years is an encouraging factor for long-term investors, but this projection is highly dependent on future performance and cannot be guaranteed.  Thorough due diligence, including analysis of the latest news and analyst opinions, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
