| 2019-2021  | -27.0%   | 78.1%    | -73.0%   | 0.3      | 2552.7   |
| 2020-2022  | -79.0%   | 84.5%    | -78.0%   | 1.0      | 1249.5   |
| 2021-2023  | -15.0%   | 84.5%    | -17.0%   | 1.6      | 2063.1   |
| 2022-2024  | 113.0%   | 84.5%    | 92.0%    | 1.6      | 3776.8   |
| 2023-2025  | -117.0%  | 90.4%    | -180.0%  | 0.6      | 398.3    |

*   **CAGR:** Volatile, ranging from -117% to 113%, showing inconsistent growth over different periods.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values indicate significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Mostly negative values suggest underperformance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500).  The recent massive negative Alpha in 2023-2025 is concerning.
*   **Beta:** Generally low but trending upward in recent years, implying increased correlation and sensitivity to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** The Capital (in Billions) fluctuates, reflecting market capitalization changes.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 94.0
*   **Last-Market:** price: 94.0, previousClose: 94.79, change: -0.83
*   **5-day SMA:** 94.46
*   **20-day SMA:** 100.26
*   **60-day SMA:** 752.53

**Analysis:** The price is below both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The massive difference between the 60-day SMA and the current price indicates a significant price drop in the recent past, pulling the short-term averages down.  The small negative price change in the last market day doesn't necessarily negate the down trend.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 23.26 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.79
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.8 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4714.6%

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI being in oversold territory (below 30) suggests the stock may be undervalued and could experience a potential bounce.
*   The negative PPO confirms the downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a buying opportunity based on oversold conditions and a potentially improved MRI value.
*   The "short-term increase" in relative divergence, combined with the oversold conditions, could signal a potential short-term rebound.
*   The extremely high expected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism. It is likely based on the model anticipating a return to historical levels or a significant correction of the recent underperformance. Such high returns are rarely realized and often indicate a high degree of risk or an unrealistic expectation.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

The news headlines suggest the following themes:

*   **Warner Bros. Deal Drama:** Uncertainty and potential implications related to dealings with Warner Bros. are impacting the stock.
*   **Buying Opportunities:** Some articles suggest the stock could be a "steal" or offer ways to gain exposure without excessive risk.
*   **Analyst Takes:** News references analyst forecasts and opinions, potentially driving market sentiment.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean of 1.95)
*   **Opinions:** 38
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 126.19 / High: 152.50 / Low: 77.00

**Analysis:** Despite the recent underperformance, analysts generally have a "Buy" rating on the stock. The average target price (126.19) is significantly higher than the current price (94.0), implying substantial upside potential according to analysts. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices suggests considerable uncertainty. The lack of information in the Recent Rating Changes prevents an accurate analysis.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Netflix has recently experienced significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. The technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold and might be due for a short-term rebound. Analyst opinions are generally positive, with a "Buy" consensus and a significantly higher average target price. However, the wide range in price targets indicates uncertainty. Recent earnings and financial data show improving revenue, reasonable profit margins, and increasing equity, indicating underlying strength in the business.

The "Warner Bros. deal drama" introduces uncertainty and volatility.  The expected return figure is excessively high and should not be relied upon.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The situation is mixed. While technical indicators suggest a potential short-term buying opportunity, the long-term underperformance, high volatility, and "deal drama" warrant caution. A potential investor should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing. The disconnect between the analyst consensus and the stock's performance highlights the need for independent judgment. A small allocation to the stock, contingent on further positive news and a clear resolution of the Warner Bros. situation, might be a considered approach.
