## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Netflix Inc. (NFLX) is a leading global provider of streaming entertainment services.  Over the period analyzed, NFLX's cumulative return of 401.37% significantly outperformed the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 124.78%. The difference is 276.59%, placing it in the 87.52nd percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (max 322.73%, min -46.94%). This suggests a substantial outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The provided Alpha values consistently indicate outperformance relative to the benchmark, with the Beta values usually above 1.0, implying higher volatility than the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $847.05 (Last Market: $846.87)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $831.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $782.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $730.03

The stock price is currently trading above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, indicating an upward trend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the last market price suggests minimal volatility immediately prior to the closing bell.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 83.75 (Overbought territory) – Suggests the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction.
* **PPO:** 0.66 (Positive) – Indicates bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +11.02 (Positive) – Shows a short-term upward trend.

The high RSI value warrants caution, suggesting a potential price pullback. The positive PPO and relative divergence indicators support the recent upward movement. The expected return of 5.16% over the long term (2+ years) against the S&P 500 is significant, but the high RSI implies caution is warranted in the near term. Given the last market price ($846.87) is close to the closing price, there is no evidence of significant immediate price jumps (either upwards or downwards).
