**1. Relative Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Netflix (NFLX) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  The cumulative return for NFLX is 340.44%, while the S&P 500's return is 120.85%. This results in a difference of 219.59 percentage points on the last day of the provided data. The relative strength indicator suggests NFLX is positioned in the 92.9th percentile of its historical performance range compared to the S&P 500.  While recent years (2020-2023) have shown negative alpha and significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the most recent period (2022-2024) shows a strong rebound with high CAGR and positive alpha.


**Company Overview:** Netflix Inc. is a streaming entertainment service offering movies and TV series on demand.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis Interpretation:** The provided Alpha and Beta data showcases volatile performance. While historically demonstrating periods of high alpha, indicating market-beating returns, recent years have seen negative alpha. The consistently low beta suggests NFLX is less volatile than the market, which contradicts the large swings in CAGR and MDD.  Further investigation is needed to reconcile this discrepancy.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Last Closing Price:** 919.13
* **Last Market Price:** 918.40
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 924.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 903.23
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 801.35

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and significantly above the 60-day moving average, indicating a short-term pullback within a broader uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 68.09 (Suggests approaching overbought territory but not yet a strong sell signal)
* **PPO:** -0.4951 (Slightly negative, indicating weakening momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.8 (Positive, suggesting increasing strength against the S&P 500 in the short term)
* **Expected Return:** 91.8% (Potentially overly optimistic given recent volatility; further due diligence is recommended)

While the RSI suggests the stock may be approaching overbought levels, the positive relative strength change and high expected return (though requiring caution) suggest continued potential upside. The negative PPO warrants attention and could signal weakening momentum.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* Revenue shows consistent growth over the reported periods, from $8.54B in Q3 2023 to $9.82B in Q3 2024.
* EPS also shows a generally upward trend, with a notable jump between Q3 2023 ($3.8) and Q1 2024 ($5.4). The duplicate entry for 2024-10-18 with different EPS values suggests a possible data error that needs clarification.

Information regarding recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions is missing and would be crucial for a complete analysis.

Given the mixed signals and missing information, a neutral stance is recommended pending further investigation.  Gathering information on recent news, analyst opinions, and verifying the accuracy of the provided data is crucial before forming a definitive investment opinion.
