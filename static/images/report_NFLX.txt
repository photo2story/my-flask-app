## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Report

**0) Executive Summary:**

Netflix Inc. is a global entertainment company providing streaming services.  The stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period, showing high growth potential but also substantial volatility.  Recent earnings show growth but profit margins are fluctuating.  Technical indicators suggest strong momentum, but high RSI levels signal potential overbought conditions.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Netflix's cumulative return of 365.18% vastly outperforms the S&P 500's 119.91% return.  The current divergence of 245.3% is near its historical maximum, indicating a significant outperformance relative to the broader market.  However, the historical data shows considerable volatility, with periods of both significant gains and losses.  The alpha and beta analysis further illuminates this, showing high alpha values in recent years indicating outperformance of the market but also very high beta values indicating higher than market risk, especially during periods of market downturns.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $976.76
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $974.37
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $905.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $886.73

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting upward momentum.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the 5-day MA suggests recent stability.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (83.03):**  Indicates the stock is significantly overbought, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (1.07):**  Positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (0.6+):** Shows recent short-term upward movement.

The recent price change of $0.36, while not dramatically large, is positive and contributes to the upward trend.  However, the extremely high RSI warrants caution.  A 10% expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is ambitious given the inherent volatility of the stock.
