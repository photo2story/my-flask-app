**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Netflix (NFLX) is a leading global provider of streaming entertainment.  The provided data shows significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), with a substantial cumulative return difference.  However, recent performance reveals significant volatility.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **NFLX Cumulative Return:** 212.54%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 66.94%
* **Return Difference:** 145.6%
* **Relative Outperformance:** 64.2% (This indicates NFLX's performance is in the 64.2nd percentile of its historical range relative to VOO's performance.  It does *not* mean NFLX outperformed VOO by 64.2%).

The table below shows the Alpha and Beta of NFLX over various periods.  Alpha represents excess return over the market (VOO proxy), while Beta measures the volatility relative to the market.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

NFLX has shown remarkable long-term growth significantly outpacing the S&P 500. However, recent performance reveals substantial volatility and high risk, as indicated by the high MRI and large MDD.  While recent earnings are positive and the long-term expected return is promising, investors should be aware of the inherent risk. The high beta signifies sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Further investigation into the causes of the recent price volatility and the duplicate entry in the earnings data is recommended before making any investment decisions.  A long-term, diversified investment strategy is advisable for mitigating risk.
