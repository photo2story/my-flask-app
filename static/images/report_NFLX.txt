2025-12-20 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Netflix (NFLX) based on the provided data.

**Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Overview:** Netflix is a leading streaming entertainment service providing movies and TV shows to its subscribers.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **NFLX Cumulative Return:** -74.82%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -174.6 (Relative Divergence: 0.8)

**Analysis:** Netflix has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The -174.6 divergence highlights this drastic difference in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 0.8 suggests the current underperformance is near the lower end of its historical fluctuation range against the S&P 500. This does not mean the stock is likely to out perform VOO going forward, it simply means it is at 80th percentile of underperformance against VOO.
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**
    *   The provided table shows rolling 3-year periods.
    *   **CAGR:**  CAGR fluctuates significantly, from positive values (90% during 2015-2017) to significantly negative ones (-117% during 2023-2025).
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility in Netflix's returns.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha, representing excess return relative to the benchmark, is highly variable, mirroring the CAGR trends.  Large negative alpha values indicate underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates between -0.0 and 1.6, suggesting the stock's movement can at times move independently or even be opposite of the S&P 500.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization is presented in billions of dollars. The table indicates consistent growth in Market Capitalization up until the 2020-2022 period. The most recent market capitalization period (2023-2025) shows a dramatic decrease.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close Price:** 94.39
*   **Previous Close:** 94.0
*   **Change:** 0.41
*   **5-day SMA:** 94.304
*   **20-day SMA:** 99.6935
*   **60-day SMA:** 733.966

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 5-day SMA but below the 20-day SMA. The 60-day SMA is a very large number, indicating a data error. This suggests a recent downtrend. The small change from the previous close suggests limited price movement on the latest trading day.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 18.42 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.0059
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 0.8 (+) (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 4714.6%

**Analysis:**

*   The **MRI of 0.7** suggests a medium investment recommendation, indicating moderate risk.
*   The **RSI of 18.42** indicates that the stock is oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity (though oversold conditions can persist).
*   The **PPO of -0.0059** suggests that the recent close is still trending below recent short-term price levels, but approaching a crossover point.
*   The **Hybrid Signal** recommends buying 100% of cash due to the oversold condition and a perceived increased MRI. This is a very aggressive signal given the other metrics.
*   The recent relative divergence change of 0.8 suggests a short-term upward trend relative to the comparison stock.
*   The **Expected Return of 4714.6%** is extremely high and should be viewed with extreme skepticism. This figure likely relies on specific assumptions or models that may not be accurate or reliable.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news headlines present a mixed picture:
    *   **Ownership Structure:**  An article discusses who owns Netflix stock.
    *   **Warner Bros. Deal/Bidding War:** Mentions drama and speculation around a potential deal with Warner Bros., potentially driving price fluctuations.
    *   **"Time to Buy the Dip":**  Suggests a bullish sentiment based on a recent price decrease.
    *   **Growth Stock Analysis:**  Puts Netflix in the context of growth stocks.
    *   **"Netflix Already Won":**  Presents a bullish argument.

**Analysis:** Recent news is centered around speculation and potential catalysts. Deal rumors and articles suggesting a buying opportunity could create short-term volatility. The "Netflix Already Won" headline suggests underlying confidence in the company's long-term prospects despite recent issues.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.95)
*   **Opinions:** 38

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Netflix has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, with a large negative divergence. The stock is currently in oversold territory based on the RSI, and a recent relative divergence change suggests a short-term upwards trend. Analyst consensus is still bullish, with a significant upside implied by the average target price. Recent news revolves around deal speculation and potential buying opportunities. Revenue, EPS, profit margins, and equity are all trending positively.

**Overall Assessment:**

The data presents a mixed picture.  The stock has experienced significant challenges recently, as evidenced by the negative returns, volatile Alpha and Beta, and high maximum drawdowns. The "buy" recommendation based on oversold indicators should be regarded skeptically. The recent improvements in revenue, profit margins, and equity are encouraging, but the highly volatile recent performance and significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, should be carefully considered. The extraordinarily high "Expected Return" is suspect and should not be relied upon.

**In conclusion, a potential investment in Netflix at this point is high-risk but potentially high-reward.  Further research and a careful assessment of your own risk tolerance are strongly recommended.**
