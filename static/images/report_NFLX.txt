## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Report

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Netflix (NFLX) shows a significantly higher cumulative return (219.33%) compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) at 76.18%.  This represents a substantial outperformance. However,  this high return needs to be analyzed in the context of the provided volatility and risk metrics.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Netflix Inc. is a leading global entertainment company providing streaming services.

The cumulative return of NFLX is 143.1 percentage points higher than VOO. This places its relative outperformance at the 65.2nd percentile of the historical maximum and minimum divergence between the two.


The provided alpha and beta values show considerable variation across the years.  While some periods exhibit high positive alpha (significantly outperforming the market), others show negative alpha and high beta (indicating higher volatility than the market).  The high beta values, especially in recent years, underscore the significant market risk associated with NFLX. The consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) until 2021, followed by significant negative CAGR, confirms the high volatility. The maximum drawdown (MDD) also points to significant risk.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $973.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $952.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $937.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $963.01

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. The recent price increase (Last-market: +1.19) is relatively small and doesn't indicate a sharp rebound or decline.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 56.68 (slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.84 (positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +4.6 (short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** 31.1% (over two years, relative to the S&P 500). This high expected return needs to be considered alongside the high risk.

The recent price movement suggests a short-term uptrend, supported by positive momentum indicators (PPO, relative divergence).  Solid financial performance with growing revenue and high profit margins further supports the company's strength.  However, the high risk profile should be carefully considered.  Investors should thoroughly assess their risk tolerance before investing in NFLX.  Further investigation is recommended to clarify the duplicate data entry in the earnings data.
