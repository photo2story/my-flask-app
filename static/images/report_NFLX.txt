**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Netflix's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 400.92% for NFLX versus 121.84% for VOO.  The difference is 279.1%, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided min/max range.  However, this high relative performance is not indicative of consistent outperformance and is susceptible to periods of significant underperformance, as seen in the provided CAGR data.

The provided data shows highly volatile alpha and beta values.  While some periods exhibit substantial alpha (significantly outperforming the market), others reveal significant negative alpha, underperforming the market considerably.

Note the dramatic drop in CAGR from 2019-2021, and 2020-2023.  The high CAGR in 2022-2025 is potentially influenced by a strong recovery from previous low points.

Netflix exhibits a high degree of volatility, resulting in significant swings in both performance and valuation.

The recent price surge and overbought RSI suggest a potential correction.  Investors should carefully consider the inherent risk before making investment decisions.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into competitive landscape, subscriber growth, and content strategy, is recommended before forming a conclusive opinion.  The provided data reveals a highly profitable company with strong growth, but also reveals considerable risk and the potential for significant drawdowns.
