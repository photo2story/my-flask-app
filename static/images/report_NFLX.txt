## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Netflix, Inc. is a leading global entertainment company providing streaming services.  The provided data shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), but recent performance has been volatile.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Netflix's cumulative return of 211.31% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's 66.69% cumulative return. The difference (144.6%) represents a high position relative to historical performance (63.7% percentile).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in several periods, indicating strong performance exceeding market benchmarks. However, significant negative CAGR in 2020-2023 indicates a period of underperformance, possibly due to increased competition and subscriber growth challenges.  High Beta values suggest high market sensitivity.  The recent increase in Alpha might indicate a return to outperformance. Capitalization (Cap) shows consistent growth.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix has shown exceptional long-term growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent performance has been volatile, with periods of significant underperformance.  Current indicators suggest a potentially bearish short-term trend, but the long-term outlook remains positive given the strong fundamentals (growing revenue, relatively high profit margins) and the high expected return.  The high market risk warrants careful consideration and a robust risk management strategy.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the 2020-2023 underperformance and clarification of the duplicate earnings data entry are recommended.  Despite the high expected return, investors should be prepared for significant price fluctuations due to the company's high beta and risk profile.
