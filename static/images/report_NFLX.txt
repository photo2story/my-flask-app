**6. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix has a history of strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500. However, recent performance has been volatile, with the stock trading below its moving averages. While financial indicators generally show a healthy company with growing revenue and profitability, the high Beta and recent price drop suggest increased risk.  The positive long-term expected return (relative to the S&P 500) and the medium market risk rating suggests a long-term investment could be worthwhile for risk-tolerant investors, after careful consideration of the recent price volatility.  Further investigation into the duplicated data in the earnings report is recommended before drawing definitive conclusions.
