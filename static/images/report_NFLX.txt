Here's a table summarizing Alpha and Beta analysis for various periods:

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|------|--------|

| 2019-2021  | -27.0%  | 78.1% | -73.0%  | 0.3  | 2552.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -79.0%  | 84.5% | -78.0%  | 1.0  | 1249.5 |

| 2023-2025  | -115.0% | 90.6% | -174.0% | 0.7  | 442.0  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Varies widely, from strongly positive (113.0%) to deeply negative (-115.0%), reflecting periods of high growth and significant decline.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown values suggest substantial volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Largely negative, indicating underperformance relative to the benchmark, except in specific periods (2015-2017, 2016-2018, 2022-2024).
*   **Beta:** Generally low, particularly in earlier periods, suggesting that Netflix's price is not strongly correlated with the broader market. However, in later years, the Beta increased to 1.0 and 1.6. It indicates that Netflix's price is now more sensitive to the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has seen significant fluctuations, reaching a high and then decreasing dramatically.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** 104.31
*   **Previous Close:** 105.67
*   **Change:** -1.29
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 108.872
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 861.2972
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 1089.2263

**Analysis:**

The current price shows a slight decrease from the previous close. The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which typically indicates a short-term downtrend. The extremely high values for the 20-day and 60-day moving averages look suspicious and warrant further investigation for potential data errors.
The change from the previous close is minimal, so a significant price surge or drop is unlikely to occur.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 5.93 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -15.71

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.8 (+) (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 45.1% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI is extremely low, indicating the stock is heavily oversold and potentially poised for a rebound.
*   The negative PPO confirms a downward trend and suggests bearish momentum.
*   The hybrid signal suggests buying based on the oversold condition and medium MRI.

**7. Overall Summary**

Netflix has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The stock is currently oversold, based on the RSI, and is trading below its recent moving averages, indicating short-term weakness. However, the MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk, and analysts have a positive consensus. Financial data show consistent revenue growth and strong profitability. The news suggests potential strategic shifts involving bidding for Warner Bros. Discovery assets. Be cautious of potentially incorrect information regarding a stock split.

**Recommendation:**

Given the oversold condition and positive analyst outlook, a small, speculative position might be considered. However, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and potential strategic changes warrant caution. Further due diligence is recommended, including verifying the stock split news and analyzing the potential impact of any WBD bids. The extremely high projected return (45.1%) should be viewed with skepticism. It's crucial to understand the assumptions behind this projection and assess their validity.
