**6) Overall Analysis:**

Netflix has shown substantial growth compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, but this growth has been volatile.  Recent financial data indicates increasing revenue and generally healthy profit margins.  While the recent price shows a slight decrease, technical indicators suggest neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The medium-risk MRI and the positive PPO suggest a potential for further growth, but the volatility necessitates careful consideration.  The projected long-term expected return is attractive, but past performance is not indicative of future results.  Investors should consider the inherent risk associated with NFLX's historical volatility before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent EPS and ROE fluctuations, as well as clarification on the duplicate data entry, is recommended.
