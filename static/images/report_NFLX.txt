**0. Executive Summary:**

Netflix, a global streaming entertainment service, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period.  While exhibiting high volatility and substantial drawdowns, its long-term CAGR remains impressive. Recent earnings show strong revenue growth, though profitability has fluctuated.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $972.58
* **Previous Close:** $973.70
* **Change:** -$0.12 (Slight decrease)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $975.99
* **20-day Moving Average:** $1007.67
* **60-day Moving Average:** $943.81

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (41.63):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.

The recent small price drop (-$0.12) isn't significant enough to indicate a dramatic shift.  The expected return of 13% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 represents a considerable upside potential, however, this should be viewed with caution considering the volatility and uncertainty inherent in the stock market.

The high long-term expected return, while promising, needs to be considered in the context of its historical volatility.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for substantial gains against the considerable risk involved.  Thorough due diligence and a long-term investment horizon are crucial for considering NFLX as part of a diversified portfolio.  Further investigation into the reasons for fluctuating profitability and the duplicate entry in the earnings data is recommended.
