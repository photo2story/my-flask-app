**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Netflix, a leading global provider of streaming entertainment, shows a significantly higher cumulative return than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While the recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn, the long-term outlook warrants further investigation.


**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **NFLX Cumulative Return:** 355.72%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 112.87%
* **Return Difference:** 242.9%

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $963.07
* **Previous Close:** $990.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $984.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $1007.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $939.81

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price drop of approximately 2.7% may indicate short-term selling pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 38.13 (Approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce)
* **PPO:** -1.15 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)

The combination of RSI and PPO suggests mixed signals.  While RSI is nearing oversold levels, the negative PPO indicates continued bearish momentum.  The significant negative price change from the previous close warrants attention. The projected long-term outperformance is positive, but should be considered alongside the short-term risks.

The high relative divergence also implies a degree of caution is warranted.
