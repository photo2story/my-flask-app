2026-01-01 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down the Netflix (NFLX) analysis.

**Company Overview:** Netflix Inc. is a leading global streaming entertainment service providing a wide variety of TV shows and movies.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (NFLX vs. S&P 500 (VOO))**

*   **NFLX Cumulative Return:** -74.98%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -177.2 (Relative Divergence: 0.3)

**Analysis:** Netflix has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) during the analyzed period.  The large negative divergence (-177.2) indicates a stark contrast in investment outcomes. The relative divergence of 0.3 suggests that the current divergence is close to the minimum divergence observed in the past.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR     | MDD   | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
| ----------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | ---- | ------ |
| 2024-2026 | -77.0% | 90.4% | -183.0% | -0.0 | 399.0  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** -77.0% shows a very significant decline in investment value over the period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 90.4% indicates substantial risk and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** -183.0% means that the stock is significantly underperforming its expected return based on its beta. This means the model thinks the company specific risk is high.
*   **Beta:**  -0.0 implies the stock is not correlated with the S&P 500 (based on the CAPM Model, which is a simple model).
*   **Cap(B):** 399.0 suggests that the amount is very high.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 93.78
*   **Last-market:** {'price': 94.175, 'previousClose': 93.78, 'change': 0.42}
*   **5-day SMA:** 93.908
*   **20-day SMA:** 95.8882
*   **60-day SMA:** 625.2634

**Analysis:** The 5-day SMA is slightly below the 20-day SMA, indicating a short-term downward trend or consolidation.  The current price is below both the 5-day and 20-day SMA, reinforcing this short-term bearish sentiment. The significantly larger 60-day SMA suggests a dramatic price decline occurred in the past 60 days.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 38.89 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** 3.6331
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 4875.5%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk, despite the poor past performance.
*   The RSI is approaching the oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, although further confirmation is needed.
*   The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being positive suggests that the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating a potential upward trend.
*   The hybrid signal indicates "Buy" with 100% of cash based on the MRI of 0.80, considering the stock being oversold.
*   The "단기하락" (short-term decline) reinforces the recent price weakness.
*   The extremely high expected return should be viewed with caution. It likely reflects a model attempting to correct for a massive undervaluation based on past performance and may not be realistic.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Warner Bros. potentially rejecting Paramount bid:** This could affect the competitive landscape in the streaming industry.
*   **Netflix out of favor, but interesting:** This suggests a contrarian view – the stock may be undervalued due to negative sentiment.
*   **"Stranger Things" movie theater event:** Initiatives to boost revenue and engagement.
*   **Trump potentially blocking Netflix-WBD deal:** Regulatory risks and potential disruption of M&A activity.
*   **Is Netflix a Must-Own Stock for 2026?:**  Reflects the uncertainty in the long-term investment outlook.
*   **Analyst targets and streaming complaints:** Indicative of market concerns.

**Analysis:** The news headlines paint a mixed picture.  On one hand, there are potential competitive challenges and regulatory uncertainties.  On the other hand, there are articles suggesting a potential contrarian investment opportunity and efforts to engage audiences.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.95)
*   **Opinions:** 38
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 126.19 / 152.50 / 77.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Buy," suggesting they believe the stock is undervalued.  The average target price of $126.19 represents a significant upside potential from the current price. However, the low target of $77 indicates some analysts are bearish.

**Analysis:** Equity has generally increased, indicating financial strength.  ROE (Return on Equity) has fluctuated, suggesting variable profitability in relation to shareholder equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Netflix has experienced significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. Recent price action suggests a short-term downward trend, although the RSI indicates it might be approaching oversold levels. Analyst consensus is a "Buy" with a substantial upside target, but the large divergence indicates huge stock specific risk.
Revenue and EPS are growing, and profitability is decent, but financial results cannot offset the large return divergence of the stock.

The news highlights competitive pressures and regulatory risks, but also potential opportunities. Ultimately, investing in Netflix at this point would be a speculative play, heavily reliant on a turnaround in sentiment and execution. The very high "expected return" should be viewed as a model correction, and not a realistic prediction.
