| 2022-2024  | 113.0%    | 84.5% | 92.0%   | 1.6   | 3776.8  |
| 2023-2025  | -117.0%   | 90.4% | -181.0% | 0.6   | 400.7   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Underperformance:** The negative cumulative return significantly lags the S&P 500.
*   **Alpha:** Negative alpha values in many periods indicate that Netflix has underperformed its benchmark even after adjusting for risk.  The significant negative Alpha for 2023-2025 is concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta values generally hovering around 0 to 1.6 suggest that Netflix's price movements are less volatile than the overall market, particularly in recent periods, moving a little more wildly (as high as 1.6).  However, the fluctuating Beta suggests changing correlation with the market.
*   **Volatility:** High MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures indicate significant price volatility and potential for substantial losses.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 94.57
*   **Previous Close:** 93.77
*   **Change:** 0.85 (slight increase)
*   **5-day SMA:** 94.07
*   **20-day SMA:** 102.02
*   **60-day SMA:** 789.45

**Analysis:**

*   **Downtrend:** The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is *far* below the 60-day SMA, suggesting a significant downtrend, although the very recent price action has been slightly positive. The 60 day SMA is either incorrect, or else indicates a very large drop in the stock price has occurred relatively recently.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Market Risk Indicator**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 32.17 (approaching oversold)
*   **PPO:** -2.48 (negative, indicating a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90) - Suggests a strong buy signal based on oversold conditions and an elevated MRI rating *specifically at the time of the signal*.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -9.0 (Negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 1757.4% (Very high potential return if invested long-term).

**Analysis:**

*   **Oversold Conditions:** The RSI suggests the stock may be oversold and could be due for a bounce.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** The MRI indicates "Medium Investment" while the RSI and PPO suggest caution. The hybrid signal emphasizes a "very safe" oversold opportunity. The long-term expected return is extremely high, but must be balanced against the short- and medium-term technical indicators.
*   **Volatility Impact:** The positive change in price reflects the volatility, even though the 20 day change is negative.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   The recent news headlines revolve around a potential deal drama involving Netflix, Warner Bros., and Paramount.  This uncertainty seems to be impacting investor sentiment.
*   Several articles discuss analyst forecasts and what investors are watching, suggesting increased scrutiny of Netflix's performance.
*   There is coverage on stock movers, which includes Netflix, highlighting its recent price fluctuations.

**Analysis:**

*   The news flow indicates significant uncertainty and volatility around Netflix, driven by potential M&A activity and analyst scrutiny. The "deal drama" likely contributes to the stock's underperformance.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.90)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 126.98 / 152.50 / 77.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not provided, so there's no recent change information.

**Analysis:**

*   Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating for Netflix, suggesting optimism about its future.
*   The average target price ($126.98) represents a significant upside from the current price ($94.57). However, the wide range of target prices (from $77 to $152.50) indicates a degree of uncertainty and differing opinions.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Netflix is exhibiting a mixed picture:

*   **Negative Performance Relative to Market:**  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. This is reflected in negative alpha and a large negative divergence.
*   **Technical Indicators:**  Technically, the stock may be oversold in the short term (RSI), but the trend is still downward (PPO).
*   **Financial Strength:**  The company's revenue, equity, and profit margins are generally growing.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:**  Analysts have a positive outlook, with a "Buy" consensus and a significant upside target price.
*   **Uncertainty:**  Recent news and M&A speculation are creating uncertainty.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in Netflix at this point carries significant risk.  The stock's underperformance relative to the market, combined with recent volatility and deal uncertainty, should give investors pause. While the company's financial fundamentals appear solid and analysts are generally positive, the short-term technical indicators suggest caution. The potential for a significant rebound exists (as indicated by the long-term expected return and the "oversold" signal), but it's a high-risk, high-reward scenario.

A potential investor should closely monitor the M&A developments and any changes in analyst ratings before making a decision. Further investigation into the cause of the 60-day SMA being as high as 789.45 is warranted, as this could reveal more about the stock's recent price history.
