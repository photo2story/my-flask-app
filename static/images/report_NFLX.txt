* **5-Day Moving Average:** $948.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $937.00
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $951.71

The price is currently slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it's below both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term correction. The recent 1.25% increase suggests a possible minor rebound.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 51.58 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.0122 (Slightly bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 0.5% (This represents the expected outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term, 2+ year investment horizon.  This is a low value and may need further context).


The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest a slightly bearish short-term outlook. The negative change in relative divergence further supports this.  The recent price increase of 1.25% could be a temporary upward movement within a broader bearish trend, or potentially the start of a sustained recovery. Further observation is necessary.
