* **60-Day Moving Average:** $855.72

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  However, the 5-day moving average is below the recent closing price which may indicate a short-term recovery or upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 27.05 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.76 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.1 – This shows a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 15.1% – This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years).  This should be interpreted cautiously, as it’s merely a projection and actual results may significantly differ.
* **Price Change:** The recent price change shows a positive daily movement of approximately 1.87%, which suggests a short-term bounce. It's not a significant *sudden* upward (or downward) move; rather, a modest increase, which is not unusual given the previously mentioned oversold conditions.

Netflix demonstrates significant historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent performance has been weak. Technical indicators suggest the stock might be oversold, potentially offering a short-term buying opportunity.

A thorough fundamental analysis considering competitive pressures, subscriber growth, and content spending is crucial for informed investment decisions.  The inconsistencies in the provided data require further investigation to obtain a more comprehensive and accurate assessment.
