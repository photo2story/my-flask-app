2025-12-23 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Netflix (NFLX) based on the data you provided, broken down into sections as requested.

**Company Overview (One Line):** Netflix is a leading streaming entertainment service providing movies and TV shows to subscribers worldwide.

**1) Return Rate Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **NFLX Cumulative Return:** -74.82%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -175.7
*   **Relative Divergence:** 0.5

**Analysis:**

*   Netflix has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period in question, with a massive divergence of -175.7.  This means that, at the end of the tracked period, Netflix's cumulative return was 175.7 percentage points lower than that of the S&P 500.
*   The relative divergence of 0.5 suggests that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range (minimum-maximum).  In other words, while significantly negative, it's not the *most* negative it's been, implying some potential for recovery *relative* to its past performance.
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    | 2023-2025  | -117.0%  | 90.4%    | -182.0%  | 0.6     | 395.1   |

    *   **CAGR Fluctuations:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is highly volatile, swinging dramatically from positive to negative. This shows a lack of consistent growth.
    *   **MDD Consistently High:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high across all periods, indicating significant risk and potential for substantial losses.
    *   **Negative Alpha:**  The Alpha is largely negative, especially in recent periods (2018 onwards), meaning Netflix has been underperforming relative to its risk (as measured by Beta). Alpha improved significantly in 2022-2024.
    *   **Beta Increasing:** The Beta generally increases over time, suggesting that Netflix's price movements are becoming more correlated with the overall market (S&P 500) and becoming more volatile than the market.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization also fluctuates.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 94.39
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 93.23, Previous Close: 94.39, Change: -1.23
*   **5-day SMA:** 94.30
*   **20-day SMA:** 99.69
*   **60-day SMA:** 733.97

**Analysis:**

*   The current price (93.23) is below both the 5-day (94.30) and 20-day (99.69) Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downward trend.
*   The large difference between the current price and the 60-day SMA (733.97) is unusual and strongly suggests there is an issue or error with the 60-day SMA figure.
*   The recent price drop of -1.23 indicates some recent negative market sentiment.

**3) RSI, PPO Index Indicators and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence, Expected_Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 18.42 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.0059
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-10)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.1 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4778.7%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A value of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk, indicating that while there are risks, the potential rewards are also present.
*   **RSI (18.42):** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is well below 30, indicating that the stock is significantly oversold. This *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, as the price may be due for a rebound.
*   **PPO (-0.0059):** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is slightly negative, suggesting a slight downward trend in price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests buying using all available cash due to the oversold condition (Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90).
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** Indicates recent underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:**  The extremely high expected return (4778.7%) should be viewed with extreme skepticism.  It is unlikely to be realistic. This is likely a model artifact based on specific historical data and is not a reliable predictor of future returns.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Investment Potential:** Several articles discuss whether Netflix is a good buy before 2026.
*   **"Buy the Dip" Mentality:** Some articles suggest that the recent price decline represents a buying opportunity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Netflix is currently in a complex situation. While revenue and earnings have shown recent growth, the stock has significantly underperformed the broader market. Recent news suggests potential major strategic shifts, analyst opinions are generally positive but with a wide range of price targets, and technical indicators signal an oversold condition that could lead to a short-term bounce. However, the long-term trend, as reflected in the MDD and recent divergence data, is concerning.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **High Risk, High Potential Reward:** Netflix remains a high-risk, high-potential reward investment. The significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and high MDD emphasize the risk.
*   **Oversold Condition:** The oversold RSI reading suggests a possible short-term trading opportunity.
*   **Strategic Uncertainty:** The news about potential takeover activity adds a layer of uncertainty and could drive future price movements.
*   **Long-Term Concerns:** The negative Alpha and volatile Beta indicate that Netflix's performance is not consistently aligned with or outperforming the market.
*   **Consider Analyst Disagreement:** While the consensus is "Buy," the wide range of analyst target prices indicates a lack of strong conviction.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted.

*   **For long-term investors:** Conduct further in-depth research into Netflix's strategic plans, competitive landscape, and long-term growth potential before making any decisions. The significant underperformance and high risk profile need to be carefully considered.
*   **For short-term traders:** The oversold condition might present a short-term buying opportunity, but this is a high-risk trade.
