2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down the analysis of Netflix (NFLX) based on the provided data.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (vs. S&P 500)**

*   **Company Overview:** Netflix Inc. is a leading global streaming entertainment service.
*   **NFLX Cumulative Return:** -74.92%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 99.09%
*   **Divergence:** -174.6 (Relative Divergence: 0.8)

**Analysis:** Netflix has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The cumulative return difference is substantial. The relative divergence of 0.8 suggests this negative divergence is near the bottom of its historical range. The divergence value means that Netflix investors have seen significant losses while the overall market has almost doubled their investments.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR      | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|-----------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 90.0%     | 71.6%  | 61.0%   | -0.0  | 813.4  |
| 2016-2018  | 63.0%     | 75.6%  | 48.0%   | 0.0   | 1134.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 29.0%     | 75.6%  | 6.0%    | 0.2   | 1371.1 |
| 2018-2020  | -31.0%    | 78.1%  | -55.0%  | 0.2   | 2291.2 |
| 2019-2021  | -27.0%    | 78.1%  | -73.0%  | 0.3   | 2552.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -79.0%    | 84.5%  | -78.0%  | 1.0   | 1249.5 |
| 2021-2023  | -15.0%    | 84.5%  | -17.0%  | 1.6   | 2063.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 113.0%    | 84.5%  | 92.0%   | 1.6   | 3776.8 |
| 2023-2025  | -117.0%   | 90.4%  | -180.0% | 0.6   | 398.3  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compounded Annual Growth Rate varies significantly, from positive to severely negative. The recent negative CAGR (-117%) is extremely concerning.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.  Drawdowns are above 70% in all periods, suggesting that at some point within each period, investors lost a large portion of their investment.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the stock's performance relative to its risk (beta).  The negative alpha values in recent periods suggest NFLX has been underperforming relative to its risk, and relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). The large negative alpha of -180% in the most recent period is very poor.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A beta around 1 suggests similar volatility to the market. Higher betas (1.0 and 1.6) show the stock becoming more volatile than the market. The drop to 0.6 most recently may suggest a decrease in volatility or a change in the stock's relationship to the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization fluctuates. A general increase followed by a very large decrease.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 94.0
*   **Last-market:** `{'price': 94.0, 'previousClose': 94.79, 'change': -0.83}`
*   **5-day SMA:** 94.464
*   **20-day SMA:** 100.2575
*   **60-day SMA:** 752.5302

**Analysis:** The stock price is below both the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The current price is also significantly below the 60-day SMA, highlighting a longer-term downward trend. The `change` value shows a small decrease in the latest market session.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 23.26 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.7893
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.8 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term Rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4714.6

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A Medium Investment recommendation suggests a moderate level of risk, but could also indicate an opportune time to enter before a rebound.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is well below 30, indicating the stock is oversold and potentially due for a bounce.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) confirms the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The algorithm suggests buying based on the oversold condition.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent change in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward movement.
*   **Expected Return:** The very high expected return indicates the model's projection for significant future growth, but this should be viewed with skepticism given the recent performance and volatility. The difference could reflect a bet on a strong turnaround from an extremely low base.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Warner Bros. Deal Drama:** Appears to be a recurring theme in the news, potentially causing uncertainty.
*   **"NFLX Stock a Steal Here?" / "How to Buy Without the Risk":** Headlines suggest the stock may be undervalued or that there are ways to mitigate risk.
*   **Analyst Takes:** News focuses on forecasts and potential future direction.

**Analysis:** The news headlines paint a mixed picture. There's talk of potential value and ways to mitigate risk, but also drama surrounding potential deals. Monitoring these developments closely is crucial.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.95)
*   **Opinions:** 38
*   **Target Price:** 126.19 (Avg) / 152.50 (High) / 77.00 (Low)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** (Empty - No information provided)

**Analysis:**

Despite the stock's poor recent performance, the analyst consensus is still a "Buy."  This could indicate that analysts believe the company's fundamentals are strong and that the stock is currently undervalued. The average target price suggests significant upside potential. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices highlights the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future. The empty "Recent Rating Changes" provide no insights into recent analyst sentiment shifts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출      |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2025-10-22 | 6      | 11.51 B$  |
| 2025-07-18 | 7.35   | 11.08 B$  |

| 2025-10-22 | 5.52   | 9.82 B$   |

**Analysis:**  Revenue and EPS (Earnings Per Share) generally show a positive trend. Revenue is growing, and EPS is also increasing over the quarters, though there is a duplicate data point listed for 2025-10-22 which needs verification. Continued revenue and earnings growth are generally positive signs.

**Analysis:**

*   **Equity and ROE:** Equity is also increasing. Return on Equity (ROE) measures profitability relative to shareholder equity. ROE has fluctuated, peaking in Q2 2025, but trending downwards in the most recent report.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Netflix is showing a deeply troubling divergence from the S&P 500, indicating significant underperformance. The stock is currently in a downtrend, reflected in its price relative to its moving averages. The RSI suggests it is oversold, and the hybrid signal suggests a possible buying opportunity.

However, this "buy" signal must be viewed cautiously. The negative Alpha values, high MDD, and very poor CAGR from the table indicate significant risk. While analyst consensus leans toward "Buy" and target prices suggest substantial upside, the wide range in target prices highlights the uncertainty.

Recent earnings and revenue growth are positive signs. The profit margin and ROE are strong. The news headlines are a mixed bag.

**Overall Conclusion:**

The data presents a conflicting picture.  While there are some positive indicators (revenue growth, oversold condition, analyst consensus), the overall risk profile is high due to the significant underperformance, volatility, and negative alpha.

**Recommendation:**

A cautious approach is warranted. Investors should carefully weigh the potential for a turnaround against the very real risks. Further research is needed to understand the "Warner Bros. deal drama" and its potential impact. Any investment should be small and only made by those with a high-risk tolerance. Monitor financial reports, news, and analyst sentiment closely. The very high expected return should be viewed with extreme skepticism.
