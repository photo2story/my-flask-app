## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Netflix Inc. is a leading global entertainment company providing streaming services.

The cumulative return of NFLX is 363.49%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 121.09%. The difference is 242.4%, placing it at the 98.8th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max values).  This indicates a strong outperformance over the period considered, though past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures, particularly in the 2016-2018 and 2023-2025 periods, indicating periods of substantial growth. However, there are periods of significant negative returns (-83% and -84%), highlighting substantial risk.  The Alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting slight outperformance compared to the benchmark, but this needs to be considered in conjunction with the Beta, which shows the stock's volatility relative to the market. The relatively high beta values (mostly above 80) indicate a high level of market sensitivity; when the market moves, NFLX tends to move more drastically. The significant fluctuations in the MDD (Maximum Drawdown) reflect this volatility.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $973.24
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $974.54
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $901.57
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $883.06

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting some recent downward pressure. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend in the longer term. The daily price change (-$0.50) shows minor downward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 70.11  — Approaching overbought territory (generally above 70), suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 1.23 — A positive value indicates upward momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -1.2 — Indicates a recent short-term downturn.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 10.2% — This represents the expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 if investing for the long term (2+ years). This is a significant projected outperformance but involves substantial risk given NFLX's volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-10-18).  Assuming the duplicate is an error and using the unique data points, we see a general upward trend in both EPS and revenue from 2023 to 2024.  However, this growth needs to be viewed in context of the overall market conditions and NFLX's price volatility.


| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-10-18 | 5.52  | $9.82B      |
| 2024-07-19 | 4.99  | $9.56B      |
| 2024-04-22 | 5.4   | $9.37B      |
| 2023-10-20 | 3.8   | $8.54B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability (profit margin) show a steady growth trend throughout 2024, with a slight dip in Q4 2023.  Equity is also increasing. Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile, with peaks in Q1 and Q2 2024 and a low in Q4 2023.  These metrics suggest a generally healthy financial position, though further analysis including debt levels and cash flow is needed for a comprehensive picture.

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity    | ROE    |
|------------|------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $10.25B    | 43.71%        | $24.74B   | 7.55%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.82B     | 47.89%        | $22.72B   | 10.40% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.56B     | 45.87%        | $22.11B   | 9.71%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $9.37B     | 46.89%        | $21.37B   | 10.92% |
| 2023-12-31 | $8.83B     | 39.91%        | $20.59B   | 4.56%  |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

NFLX shows significant historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, indicated by a large positive cumulative return. However, its high volatility (reflected in Beta and MDD) presents substantial risk.  While recent earnings and financial data point towards growth, the high RSI suggests potential near-term price correction.  The projected long-term excess return is compelling, but investors should be aware of and prepared for the significant price fluctuations inherent in this stock.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's competitive landscape, future growth prospects, and debt levels, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
