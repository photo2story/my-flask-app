## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Netflix (NFLX) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for NFLX is 294.52%, while VOO's is 112.74%. This results in a raw difference of 181.8%, placing it at the 80.5th percentile of the historical range of divergence (max: 241.3%, min: -64.1%).  Netflix's performance has been considerably higher than that of the broader market.

**Company Overview:** Netflix is a leading global entertainment provider offering streaming movies and TV shows.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high volatility in both CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different periods.  While alpha is consistently positive (though small at 0.1), indicating some outperformance, the beta fluctuates significantly, suggesting high market sensitivity and risk.  Note that the relatively constant alpha and beta across the time-spans is likely due to the reporting's grouping method.  More granular data would be helpful. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has seen substantial growth throughout the analyzed periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $828.40
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $852.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $891.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $850.30

The stock is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The price is notably lower than the 20-day and 60-day averages, indicating bearish momentum in the short-to-medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (19.79):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting a potential bounce.  However, it should be noted that RSI can stay in oversold territory for extended periods.
* **PPO (-1.28):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** The negative change of -6.7% in relative strength confirms a recent weakening trend.

The price of $828.40 is below its recent moving averages, which, in conjunction with the RSI and PPO signals, indicates a recent period of weakness. While the RSI suggests potential for a bounce, it is important to consider the other indicators' negativity.  A significant rebound from this level could be considered a sharp upward movement. The expected return of 16.2% over the long term (2+ years) represents a potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this prediction should be viewed with caution due to the underlying volatility.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix's long-term performance has significantly outpaced the S&P 500, demonstrating substantial growth. However, the stock's recent price action suggests a potential short-term downward trend. While the company's financials show strength in revenue and profitability, the high volatility and recent negative technical indicators warrant caution.  The high beta indicates considerable sensitivity to market fluctuations. The oversold RSI suggests a potential rebound, but this should be viewed in the context of the overall bearish momentum indicated by the PPO and moving averages.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy with regular contributions could potentially yield above-market returns, but carries significant risk given the historical volatility of NFLX.  Further investigation into the causes of the Q4 2023 drop in ROE and profit margin is advisable.  More granular data on earnings would significantly improve the overall analysis.
