* **Closing Price:** $837.69
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $870.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $901.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $845.96

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend.  The recent price is significantly lower than the 5 and 20 day averages, suggesting a recent decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 31.28 (Indicates oversold conditions, suggesting potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -1.14 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Divergence (20-day):** -7.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 15.4% above the S&P 500. This is a significant outperformance relative to the benchmark.

The combination of oversold RSI and negative PPO suggests a potential short-term bounce, but the negative divergence and position below moving averages are cautionary signals.  The expected return is high, but this is subject to significant market risk.  Given the price of $837.69 is below the recent moving averages, it does not necessarily reflect a rapid bounce back but a continuation of downward trend.
