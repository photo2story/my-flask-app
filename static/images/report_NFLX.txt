## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Summary:**

Netflix Inc. is a leading global provider of streaming entertainment services.  The cumulative return of NFLX is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last data point, NFLX has outperformed VOO by 217.3%,  representing a position at the 92.1st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance historically, although past performance does not guarantee future results.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high variability in performance year-over-year, influenced by market conditions and Netflix's own business evolution.  High Alpha values (above 0) in several years indicate outperformance relative to the market, while the high Beta values suggest significant market sensitivity.  The negative CAGR values in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 reveal periods of substantial underperformance. The significant jump in CAGR for 2022-2024 suggests a strong recovery.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $913.35 (Last Market: $938.49)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $918.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $880.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $782.80

The closing price is slightly below the 5-day moving average and above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages.  This suggests a recent price pullback after a period of upward momentum. The difference between the closing price and the last market price indicates a slight downward correction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 64.08  (Neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral trend.)
* **PPO:** -0.15 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum.)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +1.8 (Indicates short-term upward pressure.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 90.3%  (This is a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, if the projections hold true.)


The last market price of $938.49, slightly higher than the closing price, does not indicate a significant rapid upward or downward movement.  Further analysis is needed to determine if this is a temporary fluctuation or a start of a trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The latest quarterly results show a generally positive trend in both revenue and EPS, though some fluctuation is evident.

* **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue has consistently increased quarter-over-quarter, indicating robust growth.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS shows some volatility but a general upward trend, with a slight dip in Q4 2023.
* **Comparison:**  The EPS for the most recent quarter (2024-10-18) at 5.52 is higher than the preceding quarters.  Revenue also shows a consistent upward trend. No information on whether these results beat or missed expectations is available from the provided data.  Duplicated data entry for 2024-10-18 needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Both revenue and profit margins show a clear upward trend, indicating strong financial performance and improved efficiency.  The significant increase in profit margin between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 is noteworthy.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is generally increasing, indicating financial strength.  ROE shows variability; it experienced a notable dip in Q4 2023 before recovering in subsequent quarters.  The increase in Q1 2024 is positive but requires context to assess its sustainability.  Data for Q3 2023 appears duplicated.
