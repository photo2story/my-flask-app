| 2023-2025  | -114.0%   | 90.4% | -179.0%  | 0.6    | 438.3   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Highly volatile, ranging from -114% to +113%.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Relatively high across all periods, indicating significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** Largely negative, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark. Notably, it is extremely negative in the most recent period.
*   **Beta:**  Increased significantly in recent years, suggesting higher volatility compared to the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Fluctuates considerably, reflecting changes in market capitalization.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 103.45
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 103.48, Previous Close: 109.35, Change: -5.36
*   **5-day SMA:** 106.21
*   **20-day SMA:** 562.89
*   **60-day SMA:** 976.59

**Analysis:**

The stock is trading below all its Simple Moving Averages (SMA).  The large differences between the SMAs suggest significant price volatility. The current price decrease relative to the previous close further confirms the recent downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 2.97 (Extremely Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -12.61
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash\_0% Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90)"
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.7 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4589.5

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI being so low (2.97) suggests the stock is extremely oversold and could be due for a rebound.
*   The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being negative indicates a downward price trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a buy based on the oversold condition and MRI.
*   The 20-day divergence change confirms a recent downtrend.
*   The extraordinarily high expected return should be viewed with extreme caution. This is likely an artifact of the recent dramatic underperformance and doesn't necessarily represent a realistic projection.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **[2025-12-03]** Negative: Netflix shares pulled back despite solid results.
*   **[2025-12-01]** Positive (Speculative): Rumors of a Netflix offer for WBD (Warner Bros. Discovery) are circulating.
*   **[2025-12-03]** Negative: A Netflix director sold a significant amount of stock.

*   **[2025-12-01]** Positive: Attracting investor attention.

**Analysis:**

Recent news presents a mixed picture.  While some articles highlight potential growth and speculation of a Netflix bid for WBD, there's also negative news regarding stock pullbacks and a director selling a significant portion of their holdings.  The director's sale, in particular, could be interpreted negatively by the market.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.84)
*   **Opinions:** 44
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 134.44 / 160.00 / 77.00

**Analysis:**

Despite the recent poor performance, analyst consensus remains positive, with a "Buy" rating and an average target price significantly higher than the current price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty among analysts. The missing Recent Rating Changes are limiting.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Netflix presents a complex picture. While the company shows growth in revenue and a solid financial foundation, the stock has severely underperformed the market. Recent news is mixed, and while analysts remain optimistic, the target price range reflects uncertainty.

*   **Positives:** Revenue growth, growing equity, positive analyst consensus, extremely oversold condition (potential for a rebound), positive earnings data.
*   **Negatives:**  Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high volatility, negative Alpha, director selling stock, recent downtrend. The very high Expected Return value is likely unreliable.

**Conclusion:**

The data suggests caution. While the stock might be oversold and due for a bounce, significant risks remain. Potential investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing in NFLX. The potential catalyst of a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery could provide a short-term boost, but this is speculative. The high volatility and negative divergence should be carefully considered.
