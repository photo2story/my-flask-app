**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile alpha and beta values across the years. While high CAGR is observed in certain periods (e.g., 2015-2017, 2022-2024), the significant negative returns in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 highlight considerable risk.

The high beta values (especially in recent years) suggest high sensitivity to overall market movements.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Netflix shows strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a significantly higher cumulative return.  However, this outperformance has been volatile, reflecting the inherent risk in the stock.  While recent indicators suggest a short-term uptrend, the high beta suggests sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Long-term investors might consider the significant projected outperformance and generally healthy financials, but should also be aware of the considerable volatility.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of competitive landscape, subscriber growth, and content strategy, is essential before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data should be clarified.
