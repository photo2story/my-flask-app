The data shows high volatility and significant swings in CAGR, reflecting the risk inherent in NFLX.  The Beta fluctuates, indicating varying levels of correlation with the overall market.  The high Alpha values in recent years (2021-2025) suggest outperformance relative to the benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $932.53
* **Last Market Price:** $928.07 (Down $0.48)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $962.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $939.21
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $951.01

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The recent small price drop signals mild downward pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 56.33 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.17 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.5% (Short-term downward trend)

The indicators present a mixed picture.  While RSI suggests a neutral position, PPO indicates bullish momentum.  The negative relative divergence change and the recent slight price drop suggest caution.  The overall Market Risk Indicator is within a low to medium risk range.  Given the small price change of -$0.48, no significant sudden movements (sharp upturns or downturns) are observed.  A 0.5% expected return over the long term is modest, implying the potential for modest outperformance over the S&P 500.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix shows strong long-term growth potential, evidenced by its substantial cumulative return significantly exceeding the S&P 500.  However, the stock is volatile, as demonstrated by the large swings in CAGR and Beta. Recent price action indicates a short-term bearish trend. While financial statements show positive growth, careful consideration of the inherent risk is crucial.  The 0.5% expected return over the long-term suggests modest outperformance against the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data point and a more thorough risk assessment are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The relatively high Alpha values in recent years are encouraging but should be interpreted in the context of the overall market volatility and the company's risk profile.
