| 2023-2025  | -117.0% | 90.4% | -184.0% | 0.6    | 397.4  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Highly volatile, ranging from -117% to 113%, indicating significant performance swings.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High drawdowns in all periods, suggesting considerable risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Generally negative, implying underperformance relative to the benchmark, *except* for 2015-2019, 2022-2024.
*   **Beta:**  The Beta from 2015 - 2018 are close to zero, indicating low correlation with the market. From 2019 - 2024 The increasing Beta (especially in recent periods) suggests Netflix's price movements are becoming more aligned with the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):** This is unclear because it's in Billions but the values don't make sense given the company's actual market cap history.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 93.78
*   **Previous Close:** 94.15
*   **Change:** -0.39
*   **5-day SMA:** 93.91
*   **20-day SMA:** 95.89
*   **60-day SMA:** 625.26

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently trending downwards, sitting below both the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). The 60-day SMA is significantly higher than the current price, which implies that the average price over the last 60 days was higher than the current price, which is not possible, suggesting a data error. The small change from the previous close suggests minimal fluctuation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Market Risk**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 38.89 (approaching oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 3.63
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.8 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4863.1%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI value indicates the stock may be approaching oversold territory, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, although further confirmation is needed.
*   The PPO value being positive could mean the short-term trend is above the long-term trend
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, leveraging the oversold condition.
*   The negative change in relative divergence suggests a recent short-term decline in performance compared to the benchmark.
*   The exceptionally high expected return should be treated with extreme caution. Such high returns are rarely sustainable and often based on overly optimistic models or flawed data.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** Recent news articles present a mixed outlook on Netflix. Some articles question if it's a must-own stock for 2026.
*   **Paramount Bid:** News regarding Warner Bros potentially rejecting a Paramount bid could be affecting investor sentiment towards the streaming landscape in general, and perhaps Netflix specifically.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** At least one article suggests analysts predict a potential upside in 2026.

**Analysis:** The news suggests a period of uncertainty and speculation surrounding Netflix and the broader streaming industry. There is not a consensus on the company's value as some analysts believe in it. However, there are other factors to consider such as Paramount bid and analysts targets.

*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 126.19 / 152.50 / 77.00
