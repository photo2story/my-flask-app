2025-12-25 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Netflix (NFLX) based on the data provided.

**0. Executive Summary**

Netflix is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  The stock is exhibiting short-term downward pressure, though long-term projections suggest a high potential return. Analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy" rating, but recent news and financial data present a mixed picture of escalating costs and fluctuating profitability.

**1. Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Netflix (NFLX) is a leading streaming entertainment service, providing movies and TV shows to subscribers worldwide.
*   **NFLX Cumulative Return:** -74.82%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -175.7 (Relative Divergence: 0.5)

**Analysis:**

*   Netflix has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.
*   The divergence of -175.7 is substantial, indicating a large difference in returns. The relative divergence of 0.5 suggests that the current divergence is not at its most extreme historical point, but still represents a significant level of underperformance.
*   The Alpha and Beta analysis shows fluctuating performance over different periods.
    *   **Alpha:** Shows a wide range of performance relative to the market, with negative values indicating underperformance and positive values indicating outperformance. In recent periods (2018-2025), Alpha has been mostly negative, reflecting underperformance relative to the market.
    *   **Beta:** Indicates the stock's volatility relative to the market. A beta around 0 suggests that the stock's price movements are not strongly correlated with the market. In recent periods (2018-2025), Beta has been between 0.2 and 1.6, suggesting that the stock has become more volatile relative to the market.
    *   **CAGR:** It indicates the average annual growth rate of an investment over a specified period of time, assuming profits are reinvested during the term.
    *   **MDD:** It indicates the maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, before a new peak is attained.
    *   **Cap(B):** It indicates Market capitalization in Billions.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 94.39
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 93.64, Previous Close: 93.5, Change: 0.15
*   **5-day SMA:** 94.30
*   **20-day SMA:** 99.69
*   **60-day SMA:** 733.97

**Analysis:**

*   The current stock price is slightly above its 5-day SMA but below its 20-day SMA, suggesting short-term downward momentum.
*   The 60-day SMA is unrealistically high (733.97) which could be a data error. If correct, it highlights a stark contrast between the longer-term historical price and the current price, reinforcing the recent decline.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Hybrid Signal**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 18.42 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.0059
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4778.7%

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI of 18.42 indicates that the stock is oversold, suggesting a potential for a rebound.
*   The PPO is slightly negative.
*   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The hybrid signal recommends buying the stock based on the oversold condition and moderate risk.
*   The negative change in relative divergence confirms the short-term downward trend.
*   The extremely high expected return (4778.7%) should be viewed with extreme caution. Such a projection is unlikely and may be based on overly optimistic assumptions or modeling errors.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

The news headlines highlight a mixed sentiment:

*   **Bidding War:** The escalating bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery, involving Paramount and potentially Netflix, introduces uncertainty and potential financial burden (reworking $59B loan).
*   **Stock Performance:** Some headlines report declines ("Netflix Stock Falls," "Shares Down 1.2%"), while others suggest resilience ("Netflix Stock Holds Near $94").
*   **Investment Opportunity:** The Motley Fool article suggests Netflix is a "stock to buy now while they're on sale," indicating a potentially undervalued status.

**Analysis:**

The news paints a complex picture. The bidding war creates financial risk, while some analysts see a buying opportunity based on the lower price. The market seems to be reacting with some volatility.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~1.95 on a scale of 1 to 5)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 126.19, High: 152.50, Low: 77.00

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus leans toward a "Buy" rating, suggesting they believe the stock will appreciate. The average target price represents a significant upside from the current price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates some uncertainty among analysts.  The lack of changes in recent rating changes suggests a stable, but perhaps not overwhelmingly positive, outlook.
