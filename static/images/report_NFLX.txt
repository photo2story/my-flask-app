## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Netflix Inc. is a global entertainment company providing streaming services.  The cumulative return of NFLX is 415.71%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 125.6%. The difference is 290.11%, placing it at the 91.18th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This shows substantial outperformance, although past performance is not indicative of future results.  The provided Alpha values consistently exceed 1, further suggesting outperformance, particularly in the years 2015-2019. However, the negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 indicates periods of underperformance.  The Beta values generally indicate higher volatility than the market (above 1), except for 2019-2021.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $871.32 (Last market: $871.56)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $842.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $787.96
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $733.08

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting upward momentum.  The relatively large gap between the price and the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicates a recent significant price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 89.63 (Overbought territory) – suggests the stock is significantly overbought and potentially due for a correction.
* **PPO:** 0.8 – positive value indicating upward momentum, but not extremely strong.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +15.89%, indicating recent strong upward movement.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 2.59% –  This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 with long-term investment, but carries significant uncertainty.

The high RSI (89.63) and the large price increase relative to moving averages (especially the 60-day average) indicate a potential risk of a near-term price correction.  The closing price of $871.56 being relatively close to the last market price does not indicate any extreme events such as a sudden surge or crash.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows generally increasing revenue and EPS, with a slight dip in Q4 2023.  The most recent earnings (2024-10-18) show EPS exceeding expectations (specifics on expectations are needed for a more comprehensive analysis).  Continued revenue growth is positive but needs further context from the most recent earnings call to assess sustainability and future projections.  A more detailed analysis requires access to analyst estimates and guidance from management.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows consistent growth. Profit margins are generally high and relatively stable, except for a dip in Q4 2023, followed by a recovery in the following quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is growing, but ROE fluctuates, suggesting varying levels of profitability over time.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires real-time data from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD.  I cannot access real-time information.)*  A search for recent news (within the last two days) concerning Netflix's earnings announcements, analyst ratings, and market outlook would be crucial here.  Information about any recent regulatory changes or significant company developments should be included.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Netflix shows strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, with a significant outperformance over several periods.  However, recent performance (2021-2023) has been weaker, and current technical indicators (RSI) suggest the stock may be overbought.  While recent earnings data is positive, a complete assessment requires analysis of the full earnings report, including future guidance, and a thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions.  The high beta suggests higher volatility than the market.  Long-term investors might consider the 2.59% expected excess return, but should be aware of the inherent risk associated with a potentially overvalued stock and its high volatility.

**8. Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, a definitive buy, hold, or sell recommendation cannot be made.  The overbought condition (high RSI) suggests a potential near-term correction is possible. Further research is needed to account for recent news, earnings call specifics, and analyst projections.  A comprehensive risk assessment considering the historical volatility (high beta) is also crucial.  The potential long-term growth warrants further investigation, but caution is advised due to the current technical indicators.
