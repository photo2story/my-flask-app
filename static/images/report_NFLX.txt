## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Report

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Netflix, a global provider of streaming entertainment, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While further analysis is needed, this initial observation warrants deeper investigation into the drivers of this outperformance and the sustainability of such returns.

**1) Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **NFLX Cumulative Return:** 208.25%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 71.02%
* **Return Difference:** 137.2%
* **Relative Divergence:** 63.9% (This indicates NFLX's performance is in the upper 63.9th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO.)

The provided data clearly shows NFLX significantly outpaced the S&P 500.  However, the high relative divergence and the volatile nature of the alpha and beta (detailed below) suggest significant risk and potential for future underperformance.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 93.0% | 60.6% | 63.0% | -0.0 | 82.1 |

| 2023-2025  | 123.0% | 74.1% | 120.0% | 0.8 | 366.1 |

The high CAGR values in several years are offset by significant negative returns in others, particularly 2020-2022 and 2021-2023.  The fluctuating beta suggests significant market sensitivity, while the inconsistent alpha indicates varying levels of outperformance relative to the market. The large swings in performance highlight the inherent volatility of NFLX.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $855.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $913.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $933.00
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $952.82

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The significant daily change (-6.67%) suggests a potentially sharp price correction.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 32.72 (Oversold, but caution is warranted given the volatility)
* **PPO:** -0.7343 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.9% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 27.2% (over 2 years)


The technical indicators suggest a bearish market sentiment.  The high MRI reinforces the risk associated with NFLX. The significant daily price drop (-6.67%) reflects a substantial negative market event that needs further investigation.  The expected return is high but needs to be viewed in the context of the high risk indicated by other factors.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Netflix has demonstrated significant historical outperformance against the S&P 500. However, this has come with substantial volatility. Recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook. While the long-term expected return is positive, the high risk profile, evidenced by the MRI and fluctuating alpha/beta, requires careful consideration.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price drop (-6.67%) and clarification of the duplicate earnings entry are necessary for a more comprehensive assessment.  The strong financial performance offers a degree of underlying support but cannot overshadow the current market sentiment and risk profile.  A cautious approach is recommended, with thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.
