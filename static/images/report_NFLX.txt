*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The signal recommends buying with all available cash, characterizing it as a "Very Safe (OverSold Boost)." This contradicts the other analysis of the stock.
*   **Divergence Change:** A negative divergence change over the past 20 days confirms the recent price decline.
*   **Expected Return:**  A very high expected return suggests that if the downturn stabilizes, and the stock recovers, there is potential for significant gains in the long term. However, it is also not an absolute guarantee and must be approached cautiously.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

The data paints a conflicting picture of Netflix.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Netflix appears to be a high-risk, potentially high-reward investment at this time. While the recent price action is concerning and indicates strong downward momentum, the company's underlying financial performance is improving. The "Buy" recommendations from analysts and the "oversold" reading from the RSI, along with the potential acquisition news, suggest a possible rebound.
