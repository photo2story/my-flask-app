The analysis aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Netflix's current standing and potential future trajectory.

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Netflix Inc. is a leading streaming entertainment service provider.

*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 100.58%

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table Interpretation:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B)  |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|------|---------|
| 2015-2017  | 90.0%   | 71.6%   | 61.0%   | -0.0 | 784.3   |
| 2016-2018  | 63.0%   | 75.6%   | 48.0%   | 0.0  | 1093.6  |
| 2017-2019  | 29.0%   | 75.6%   | 6.0%    | 0.2  | 1322.0  |
| 2018-2020  | -31.0%  | 78.1%   | -55.0%  | 0.2  | 2209.3  |
| 2019-2021  | -27.0%  | 78.1%   | -73.0%  | 0.3  | 2461.4  |
| 2020-2022  | -79.0%  | 84.5%   | -78.0%  | 1.0  | 1204.8  |
| 2021-2023  | -15.0%  | 84.5%   | -17.0%  | 1.6  | 1989.2  |
| 2022-2024  | 113.0%  | 84.5%   | 92.0%   | 1.6  | 3641.7  |
| 2023-2025  | -114.0% | 90.4%   | -179.0% | 0.6  | 424.8   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth rate over the period. The most recent period (2023-2025) has a significantly negative CAGR of -114.0%.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period.  MDD is consistently high, particularly in the most recent periods, suggesting high volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Represents the excess return of the investment compared to the benchmark (market). Negative Alpha values, especially in recent periods, indicate underperformance relative to the market. The -179.0% Alpha for 2023-2025 is a major concern.
*   **Beta:** Measures the volatility of the investment relative to the market. Beta values are low until 2020-2022, 2021-2023 and 2022-2024, indicating that the stock had relatively low volatility until the recent years. Recent Beta values are considerably high, suggesting that the stock has been more volatile and sensitive to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Indicates Market Cap in Billions. Market Cap has generally increased, but declined drastically from 2022-2024 to 2023-2025.

**Overall Assessment:** The historical data presents a mixed picture.  While there were periods of very strong growth (2015-2017, 2016-2018, 2022-2024), the more recent performance (2018-2025) is concerning. The high MDD and negative Alpha suggest significant risk and underperformance in recent years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 103.96
*   **Last Market:** Price: 100.24, Previous Close: 103.22, Change: -2.89
*   **5-day SMA:** 106.12
*   **20-day SMA:** 513.29
*   **60-day SMA:** 957.26

**Analysis:**

The current price (100.24) is below the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs).  This indicates a short-term downtrend. The large difference between the short-term (5-day) and longer-term (20-day, 60-day) SMAs reinforces this. The recent price decline of -2.89 further supports the downtrend.

**3) RSI, PPO Index, and Divergence Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 1.12
*   **PPO:** -11.52
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.7 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4589.5%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A Medium Investment MRI suggests that while the stock has risks, it's not considered extremely risky based on the model.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 1.12 is extremely low, suggesting the stock is significantly oversold and potentially due for a rebound. (RSI typically ranges from 0 to 100.)
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO of -11.52 indicates that the short-term moving average is significantly below the long-term moving average, reinforcing the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy" signal based on the oversold condition and MRI indicates that the system believes there's a potential for a short-term rebound.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days confirms the recent underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** A very high expected return (4589.5%) should be viewed with extreme caution.  This likely reflects the model's expectation of a significant rebound from a heavily oversold position, but it's not a guarantee and should be considered a high-risk, high-reward scenario.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** The news headlines paint a concerning picture.  There's worry about a deal (Warner Bros. Discovery?), debt, insider selling, and price target forecasts.
*   **Specific Concerns:**
    *   The Barron's article highlights worries about a deal's high price and debt.
    *   The MarketBeat article notes insider selling, which is generally viewed negatively by investors.
    *   The TS2.tech article mentions the deal jitters, insider sales, and forecasts.
*   **Contradictory Opinion:** The CNBC article presents a counterpoint, suggesting that trimming Netflix stock is a mistake. This highlights the divided opinions surrounding the stock.

**Analysis:**

The recent news is predominantly negative.  Concerns about a potential deal, debt, and insider selling are likely contributing to the recent price decline. The mixed analyst opinions (CNBC article) show there's still some belief in the company's potential, but the overall sentiment is cautious.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.83)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 133.41, High: 160.00, Low: 77.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not provided

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is "Buy," with a mean rating of 1.83, suggesting a generally positive outlook. The average target price of $133.41 represents a significant upside from the current price of $100.24. However, the wide range between the high ($160.00) and low ($77.00) target prices indicates uncertainty among analysts.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜         | EPS   | 매출       |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-10-22   | 6     | 11.51 B$   |
| 2025-07-18   | 7.35  | 11.08 B$   |
| 2025-04-18   | 6.76  | 10.54 B$   |
| 2024-10-18   | 5.52  | 9.82 B$   |
| 2025-10-22   | 5.52  | 9.82 B$   |

**Analysis:**

Revenue and EPS both show an upward trend (except for the last duplicated row in the provided table, which should be removed or corrected). This suggests that Netflix is growing its top and bottom lines effectively. However, the recent stock performance doesn't align with this positive earnings trend, which could indicate other factors (like the concerns mentioned in the news) are weighing on the stock.

**6) Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2025-09-30   | $25.95B  | 9.81%   |

**Analysis:**

Equity has generally increased, indicating growth in the company's assets. ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates, indicating varied profitability of equity investments, but is generally positive.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Netflix presents a complex picture.

*   **Negative Short-Term Signals:** The stock is currently in a downtrend, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. Negative news headlines (deal concerns, debt worries, insider selling) are likely contributing to this. The RSI is extremely oversold, suggesting a potential rebound, but the PPO confirms the downtrend.
*   **Mixed Historical Performance:** While past performance (2015-2018, 2022-2024) showed significant growth, recent years (2018-2025) are concerning, with high MDD and negative Alpha indicating significant risk and underperformance.
*   **Positive Financials:** Revenue and EPS are trending upward, and profit margins are strong. Equity has also generally increased. This suggests that the underlying business is performing relatively well.
*   **Analyst Optimism with Uncertainty:** Analysts have a "Buy" consensus with a significant potential upside. However, a wide range of price targets reflects uncertainty.
*   **High-Risk, High-Reward Potential:** The exceptionally high "expected return" (4589.5%) is likely based on the oversold condition and potential for a rebound. However, this should be approached with caution and shouldn't be considered a guaranteed outcome.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in Netflix at this point appears to be a high-risk, high-reward proposition. The negative short-term signals and market sentiment need to be carefully weighed against the positive underlying financial performance and potential for a rebound. Investors should closely monitor news, analyst opinions, and technical indicators before making a decision. The analysis indicates this may be a good entry point for long-term investors comfortable with volatility, but caution is warranted.
