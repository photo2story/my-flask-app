2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Netflix (NFLX) based on the provided data, broken down into sections as requested:

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **NFLX Overview:** Netflix Inc. is a leading streaming entertainment service company.
*   **NFLX Cumulative Return:** -74.92%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 99.09%
*   **Divergence:** -174.6 (Relative Divergence: 0.8)

**Analysis:** NFLX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period. The cumulative return difference is substantial.  The divergence figure of -174.6, along with the relative divergence of 0.8, indicates that the current divergence is near the lower end of its historical range. The relative divergence of 0.8 indicates this position is near the very bottom of its fluctuation range, which can be interpreted as an extreme oversold position.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD  | Alpha    | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|------|----------|------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 90.0%   | 71.6% | 61.0%    | -0.0 | 813.4  |
| 2016-2018  | 63.0%   | 75.6% | 48.0%    | 0.0  | 1134.2 |

| 2018-2020  | -31.0%  | 78.1% | -55.0%   | 0.2  | 2291.2 |
| 2019-2021  | -27.0%  | 78.1% | -73.0%   | 0.3  | 2552.7 |
| 2020-2022  | -79.0%  | 84.5% | -78.0%   | 1.0  | 1249.5 |
| 2021-2023  | -15.0%  | 84.5% | -17.0%   | 1.6  | 2063.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 113.0%  | 84.5% | 92.0%    | 1.6  | 3776.8 |
| 2023-2025  | -117.0% | 90.4% | -180.0%  | 0.6  | 398.3  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows wide fluctuations, highlighting periods of strong growth (2015-2017, 2022-2024) and significant declines (2020-2022, 2023-2025). The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a concerning negative CAGR.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha has been largely negative in recent periods, meaning NFLX has underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.  There have been periods of significant positive Alpha, such as 2015-2017 and 2022-2024.
*   **Beta:** Beta has generally increased over time and remained at 1, implying Netflix's stock price movements became strongly correlated with the benchmark index (S&P 500)'s fluctuations, and has been at 1.6 in recent years, indicating that NFLX is now more volatile than the overall market. But recently it has been decreased to 0.6.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization shows growth over time, but the drop in 2023-2025 from the prior period indicates a loss of market capitalization.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 94.0
*   **Previous Close:** 94.79
*   **Change:** -0.83
*   **5-day SMA:** 94.46
*   **20-day SMA:** 100.26
*   **60-day SMA:** 752.53

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the previous close. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which indicates a short-term downward trend. The extremely high 60-day SMA, compared to the current price, suggests a significant price decline in recent months.  The negative change from the previous close further reinforces this downward momentum. The extremely high 60-day SMA is suspicious and should be verified. It could be a data error.

**3) Index Indicators and Expectations:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 23.26
*   **PPO:** -0.79
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-10)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.8 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4714.6
*   **Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.**

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is very low, indicating that the stock is oversold. This often suggests a potential for a price rebound.
*   **PPO:** The PPO is negative, indicating that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, suggesting a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal indicates an oversold condition and recommends buying. This reinforces the RSI signal. The change on the 2025-11-10 is a bit unclear.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests that the stock has experienced a short-term upward movement, despite the overall negative trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return should be viewed with significant skepticism. While the data suggests potential for a rebound, a return of this magnitude is highly unlikely and potentially based on flawed calculations.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news headlines revolve around:
    *   Potential Warner Bros. deal drama impacting NFLX stock.
    *   Strategies for investing in Netflix with reduced risk.
    *   Analyst opinions and forecasts for NFLX.
    *   Discussion of Netflix as a potentially cheap stock.
    *   Stock movers.

**Analysis:** The news suggests uncertainty around Netflix's future, particularly regarding potential deals. The articles discussing "risk-free" ways to invest or whether the stock is a "steal" indicate investor concern and a potential perception of undervaluation. However, the negative headlines, like Warner Bros. deal drama, show that there are still concerns that may cause the recent price decline.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy
*   **Mean Rating:** 1.95 (~Buy)
*   **Opinions:** 38
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 126.19 / 152.50 / 77.00

**Analysis:**  Despite the recent poor performance, analyst sentiment is generally positive, with a "Buy" consensus and a mean rating leaning towards "Buy". The average target price suggests potential upside from the current price. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices shows a lack of strong conviction and significant disagreement among analysts. The missing recent rating changes also provides limited information.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출       |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-10-22 | 6     | 11.51 B$   |

| 2025-04-18 | 6.76  | 10.54 B$   |
| 2024-10-18 | 5.52  | 9.82 B$    |
| 2025-10-22 | 5.52  | 9.82 B$    |

**Analysis:**  Revenue and EPS appear to be generally trending upward year-over-year (comparing the last item to the fourth item.) There is consistent revenue growth between the quarterly reports. The Earnings per share is high which indicates high profitability per outstanding share.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a consistent upward trend, indicating growth in the business. Profit margins are strong, generally above 45%, which is a positive sign. The margin has been fluctuating slightly.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is also trending upwards, showing a growing asset base. Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile and the latest ROE is at 9.81% in 2025-09-30.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Netflix presents a mixed picture. On one hand:

*   **Strong Fundamentals:** Revenue and equity are growing, and profit margins are healthy. Analyst consensus is still positive.
*   **Oversold Condition:** RSI indicates the stock is oversold, and the Hybrid Signal suggests a buying opportunity.
*   **Potential Upside:** The average analyst target price suggests potential gains.

However:

*   **Underperformance:** NFLX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** The stock is highly volatile, as evidenced by the high MDD and fluctuating Beta.
*   **Negative Sentiment:** Recent news and price action indicate investor concern.
*   **Uncertainty:** The potential Warner Bros. deal drama creates uncertainty.
*   **Questionable Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return is unrealistic and should be disregarded.
*   **High 60-day SMA:** The extremely high 60-day SMA compared to the current price is suspicious and should be verified. It could be a data error.

**Conclusion:**

Netflix's recent performance has been poor, but the data suggests the stock *might* be oversold and *potentially* poised for a rebound. However, the high volatility, underperformance relative to the market, and external uncertainties make it a risky investment.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Caution is advised.** Do thorough independent research before investing.
*   **Verify the 60-day SMA.** A data error could significantly skew the analysis.
*   **Understand the risks.** The stock's volatility and dependence on external factors make it a high-risk/high-reward proposition.
*   **Be skeptical of the high expected return.** It's unlikely to be accurate.
