Netflix Inc. provides streaming services.  The cumulative return of NFLX is 326.28%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 114.36%.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix shows a history of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but with considerable volatility.  Recent price action suggests a potential short-term downward trend, though the RSI indicates it's not severely oversold.  Financial statements show improving revenue and profit margins, but the ROE needs further investigation.  Missing information on recent news and analyst opinions limits a comprehensive conclusion. The high long-term expected return should be viewed cautiously due to inherent market risk.  More detailed analysis, including comparisons to earnings expectations and a review of recent news and analyst sentiment, is needed for a more complete investment assessment.
