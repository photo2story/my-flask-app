## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Netflix Inc. (NFLX) is a leading global provider of streaming entertainment services.  The cumulative return of NFLX is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **NFLX Cumulative Return:** 302.24%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 116.43%
* **Return Difference:** 185.8%

The relative divergence of 81.8% indicates that NFLX's performance has been substantially above the S&P 500 over the period considered, placing it in the upper 81.8th percentile of historical performance relative to the benchmark.  However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for NFLX in several periods, indicating strong historical growth. However, the significant negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 highlights periods of substantial underperformance.  The relatively consistent alpha around 0.1 suggests some degree of outperformance, but this needs to be viewed in the context of the high volatility shown by the Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 87.0% | 29.6% | 60.0% | 0.1 | 361.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 79.0% | 42.0% | 64.0% | 0.1 | 361.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 88.0% | 42.0% | 56.0% | 0.1 | 361.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 150.0% | 42.0% | 117.0% | 0.1 | 361.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 128.0% | 32.2% | 48.0% | 0.1 | 361.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -73.0% | 75.2% | -80.0% | 0.1 | 361.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -78.0% | 75.2% | -102.0% | 0.1 | 361.0 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $844.61
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $839.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $884.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $854.32

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 17.33 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce but not confirming it)
* **PPO:** -0.99 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.1% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 15.7% over the long term (2+ years)


The current price of $844.61 does not, by itself, indicate a dramatic price swing (rapid rise or fall).  However, the combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and the price being below moving averages suggests a bearish sentiment.  The high expected return is encouraging for long-term investors, but it's vital to remember this is a projection and not a guarantee.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

NFLX has demonstrated significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, although this has been punctuated by periods of substantial volatility and underperformance.  Current technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook. However, strong revenue growth, generally healthy profit margins, and a positive long-term expected return provide a more optimistic long-term perspective for investors with a high risk tolerance.  Further research into the reasons for the Q4 2023 dip in ROE is recommended, as is a deeper analysis of the company's competitive landscape and future growth prospects.  The high projected return necessitates careful consideration of risk.
