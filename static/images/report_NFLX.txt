**8. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix demonstrates strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with high alpha and fluctuating beta values reflecting higher volatility.

Strong financial performance, particularly in the most recent quarter, supports the positive outlook.

The long-term expected return is substantial but relies on several assumptions and factors that should be carefully considered.
