*   **Hybrid Signal:** The recommendation to hold a high cash position suggests caution from the algorithm.
*   **Volatility:**  NFLX has historically been volatile, as indicated by the MDD figures. Be prepared for price swings.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, further investigation is required before making any investment decisions. Specifically:

1.  **Research the news:**  Thoroughly investigate the news and events that triggered the recent price decline.
2.  **Monitor Price Action:** Closely monitor price movement in the coming days/weeks to see if the downtrend continues or if a reversal occurs.
3.  **Assess Risk Tolerance:** Consider your own risk tolerance before investing in a volatile stock like NFLX.
