## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Summary:**

Netflix, a leading global streaming entertainment service, shows significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  While exhibiting high volatility, its recent earnings and financial data suggest strong profitability, although recent years have shown periods of significant negative returns.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Netflix's cumulative return (220.09%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (66.27%) over the analyzed period.  The current divergence of 153.8 points places it at the 67.7th percentile of historical divergence (max: 228.7, min: -3.2), indicating a historically high level of outperformance relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a high degree of volatility and market sensitivity.  While some periods show significant positive alpha (outperformance), others, particularly 2020-2023, show substantial negative returns, highlighting the inherent risk associated with Netflix. The beta values, generally above 0.0, indicate sensitivity to overall market movements, with occasional periods of higher-than-average sensitivity.  High CAGR figures in some periods are offset by significant Maximum Drawdowns (MDD).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $976.28
* **Previous Close:** $931.28

* **20-day Moving Average:** $936.06
* **60-day Moving Average:** $961.16

The closing price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating some potential for further upward movement or consolidation. The significant increase of $45 from the previous close to the closing price represents a notable jump that is likely the outcome of a recent market event.

* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +1.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 34.3%  This represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years). This significant positive expected return should be considered carefully, given the high volatility indicated in the Alpha/Beta analysis and the high level of market risk.

The sharp increase in price from the previous close ($4.83) indicates a recent, potentially significant market event, contributing to the relatively high 5-day MA compared to the previous close.
