| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |

| 2022-2024  | 113.0%   | 84.5%    | 92.0%   | 1.6   | 3776.8 |
| 2023-2025  | -114.0% | 90.4% | -180.0% | 0.6 | 455.9 |

*   **CAGR:** Shows a highly volatile growth trajectory, with significant positive and negative swings.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures across all periods indicate substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha has been largely negative, especially in recent years, suggesting underperformance relative to its benchmark. However, the period from 2022-2024 shows a very strong alpha.
*   **Beta:** Beta values have increased over time, suggesting Netflix's price movements are becoming more correlated with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization increased until 2023-2025 period, suggesting the company grew in valuation, and then significantly contracted

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 107.58
*   **Previous Close:** 106.14
*   **Change:** 1.36
*   **5-day SMA:** 105.88
*   **20-day SMA:** 663.1877 (Incorrect Data)
*   **60-day SMA:** 1014.5131 (Incorrect Data)

**Analysis:** The data provided for the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) appears to be significantly incorrect and does not align with the current share price. The recent small price increase suggests a slight upward trend, and the 5-day SMA is just slightly below the current price.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 5.65 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -14.60
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (1 share - Very Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -47.9 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4526%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  The MRI suggests a high level of confidence in investment at the current level.
*   **RSI:** An extremely low RSI value indicates the stock is heavily oversold and *may* be due for a rebound.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a buy based on the oversold conditions and the MRI.
*   **Divergence Change:** Recent relative divergence has decreased, confirming the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return should be viewed with extreme caution. It is likely based on a model that anticipates a significant correction/rebound and may not be realistic.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Netflix's 'Stranger Things' Finale:** Could provide a short-term boost to the stock.
*   **Potential Stock Split:** A stock split could make the stock more accessible to retail investors. *Note: The news articles mention a 10-for-1 split, but a split doesn't fundamentally change the value of a company.*
*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news articles show mixed sentiment, with some suggesting the stock has already "eaten the feast" (perhaps implying limited further upside), while others highlight potential growth and inclusion in "unstoppable" stock lists.
*   **$1,000 into $1 Million:** Positive sentiment as NFLX has been noted as a long term growth stock.

**Analysis:**

The recent news paints a mixed picture. The 'Stranger Things' finale and potential stock split could act as positive catalysts, but analysts are offering a range of opinions. The focus on long-term growth potential versus short-term gains creates uncertainty.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.84)
*   **Opinions:** 44
*   **Target Price:** Average: 134.44
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is generally positive ("Buy"), with a target price significantly above the current price. This indicates analysts believe the stock is undervalued.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this data, NFLX appears to be a high-risk, potentially high-reward investment. The current oversold condition and positive analyst ratings might suggest a buying opportunity. However, the stock's historical underperformance, high volatility, and recent downward trend should give investors pause. Further research and careful consideration of risk tolerance are essential before investing. Remember to verify the accuracy of the SMA data.
