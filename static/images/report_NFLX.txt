Netflix (NFLX) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The cumulative return for NFLX is 316.69%, while VOO's is 115.41%.

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows high volatility in both CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different timeframes, with periods of extreme growth and significant losses. The consistent beta of approximately 0.1 suggests low correlation with the overall market, indicating that Netflix's performance is largely driven by factors specific to the company.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $875.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $880.75
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $905.30
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $843.88

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 33.12 -  Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.92 - Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.5% - Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.

The current price of $875.00, being below the moving averages and with bearish indicators, doesn't suggest a recent sharp rebound.  The expected return of 13.6% over the long term (2+ years) represents a potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but this is contingent upon future market conditions and company performance.

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue has steadily increased quarter-over-quarter.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS also shows a general upward trend, although there was a dip in the quarter ending 2023-12-31.  The two entries for 2024-10-18 are identical and possibly represent an error in the data provided.
