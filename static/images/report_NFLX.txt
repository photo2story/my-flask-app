* **5-Day Moving Average:** $921.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $894.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $794.12

The price is currently above its 20-day moving average but below its 5-day moving average, suggesting some recent price consolidation or a minor pullback after a recent rally.  The price is significantly above the 60-day moving average.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 56.44 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.32 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -2.1% (Indicates a recent weakening in relative strength)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 91% (This is a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This projection needs to be treated cautiously.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.)

The current price of $918.87 does not suggest an extreme event (no significant recent spike).  The combination of indicators presents a mixed signal.  While the RSI is not extreme, the negative PPO and declining relative strength suggest caution. The high expected return should be viewed critically due to inherent market volatility and the limitations of forecasting long-term returns.
