Netflix Inc. is a leading global provider of streaming entertainment.  The provided data shows Netflix significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return of 377.02% compared to the S&P 500's 120.25%. The substantial difference highlights Netflix's strong performance, but also its higher volatility, indicated by the wide range of historical divergence (max 266.2%, min -64.1%). The current divergence is near the historical maximum.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show varying performance relative to the market.  While high alpha values in recent years (2021-2025) indicate significant outperformance,  the negative CAGR and high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) in 2020-2022 highlight substantial risk. The increasing beta also suggests increasing market correlation in recent years.  The substantial increase in market capitalization also reflects the company’s growth throughout the years.

* **Current Price:** $1008.08
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $1015.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $954.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $912.30

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential support and a longer-term uptrend.  The recent price decrease of -1.9% compared to the previous close signifies a slight bearish signal.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 70.41 – Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO:** 0.45 – Positive value indicates bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.8 – Short-term bearish trend.

The combination of a high RSI and a negative divergence in relative strength suggests caution. While the PPO shows bullish momentum, the overbought RSI and negative divergence warn of potential short-term bearish pressure.  The recent price drop (-1.9%) supports this short-term bearish outlook.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix's historical performance has significantly outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating substantial growth potential.  However, recent performance shows increased volatility and risk, highlighted by high MDD values and negative CAGR in certain periods. The current price is showing signs of a short-term bearish trend, although longer-term indicators remain positive.  High RSI levels warrant caution, but positive PPO suggests ongoing momentum.  Financials generally point toward a healthy and growing company, although some profit margin and ROE fluctuations require further investigation. The significant long-term expected return (10.8% vs S&P 500) makes it an attractive long-term investment option for risk-tolerant investors, but short-term volatility should be factored in.  Further analysis is needed to address the duplicate earnings data entry and understand the reasons behind fluctuations in profit margins and ROE.
