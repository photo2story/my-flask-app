## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Investment Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

The table shows high volatility with periods of substantial growth followed by significant declines.  The consistently low beta suggests limited correlation with the overall market, while the alpha fluctuates significantly.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $902.04
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $910.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $905.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $807.15

The price is slightly below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downward trend.  However, it's significantly above the 60-day moving average, suggesting a longer-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.87 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.84 (Slightly bearish)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.5 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 93.0% (exceeds S&P 500 significantly).  This high expected return needs to be viewed in context of the high risk outlined in other sections.  The high expected return reflects that the current price is discounted compared to the long-term model.


The current price of $902.04, while slightly below recent averages, does not indicate a significant drop warranting a label like "sudden drop".  However, the high expected return combined with other indicators necessitates a deeper dive into the fundamentals.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**  *This section requires information not provided in the initial prompt.*  Information on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions is needed to complete this section.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix shows strong revenue growth and generally high profitability. However, the substantial volatility in EPS, ROE, and historical price action highlights significant risk. While the long-term expected return is high, the substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the high relative divergence (92.4%) indicate a potentially overvalued stock or a high probability of correction.  Further investigation into the Q4 2023 dip in profit margin and ROE is warranted, as is a review of recent news and analyst sentiment.  The provided data, while offering a snapshot, is insufficient for a complete and confident investment recommendation.  Additional research is necessary.
