* **Last Market Price:** $924.44
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $975.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $943.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $949.77

The stock price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend. However, it remains above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a relatively strong longer-term trend.  The last market price shows a significant drop from the previous close (-1.01), hinting at potential short-term volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 64.07 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.7442 (Positive; suggests bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.4% (Long-term, 2+ years, exceeding S&P 500)

The technical indicators suggest a relatively healthy market outlook.  The recent price drop, while notable, doesn't necessarily signal a major reversal, given the positive PPO and relatively low RSI.  The positive expected return suggests potential for outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

NFLX has shown impressive historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. While recent price action shows some short-term weakness, the longer-term trends remain positive, supported by strong financial results and generally bullish technical indicators. The high relative divergence indicates that the current outperformance is historically significant.  However, the considerable historical volatility (high MDD) necessitates a cautious approach.  Long-term investors might find the potential for above-market returns attractive, but careful risk management is crucial given the inherent volatility of the stock.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and the duplicate earnings data entry is recommended.
