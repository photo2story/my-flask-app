The difference is 217.1%, placing it at the 92.1st percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $913.69

However, it's significantly above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a stronger uptrend in the medium to long term.  The last market price of 913.78, being very close to the closing price, doesn't suggest a significant immediate price jump or drop.

* **RSI:** 69.24 –  Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO:** -0.0167 – Slightly negative, indicating bearish momentum, although it is near zero.

* **Expected Return:** 90.1% –  This represents a substantial projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500 assuming consistent performance.  This projection, however, needs to be treated with caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a generally upward trend in both revenue and EPS.  However, there are some inconsistencies in the reported data where the October 18th, 2024 data is duplicated.  Assuming the duplicate is an error and using the single set of data, the following can be observed:

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue has consistently increased quarter-over-quarter.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS showed some fluctuations but generally increased. There was a notable dip in Q4 2023, followed by a recovery.
* **Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison:** The most recent quarter (2024-Q3) shows continued growth in both revenue and EPS compared to previous quarters. The profit margin also increased considerably, indicating improved profitability.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data reveals a healthy financial position for Netflix:

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Strong revenue growth and increasing profit margins are positive indicators of financial health.  The increase in profit margin from 39.91% (2023-Q4) to 47.89% (2024-Q3) is particularly noteworthy.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is steadily growing, and ROE has seen improvements, although a dip occurred in 2023-Q4, before recovering.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix demonstrates strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent financial data shows robust revenue growth, improving profitability, and a generally positive trend in EPS.  However, some caution is warranted given the RSI approaching overbought levels and the slightly negative PPO, suggesting potential near-term price correction. The projected long-term return is significant, but this projection is highly dependent on maintaining the current positive momentum and is not a guarantee. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a fully comprehensive assessment. Further research into recent news, analyst ratings, and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions.
