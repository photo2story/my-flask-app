## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Netflix Inc. is a leading global entertainment company providing streaming services.  The cumulative return of NFLX is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last data point, NFLX shows a cumulative return of 431.34%, while VOO shows 127.58%. The difference is 303.76%, placing it at the 94.87th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance compared to the benchmark.  The provided alpha values (generally above 0.8 except for 2020-2022) also suggest consistent outperformance, though the beta (generally above 1) reveals higher volatility than the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $897.79 (Last Market: $884.92)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $879.50
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $808.99
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $743.19

The stock price is currently trading above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend. The distance between the price and the moving averages indicates increasing momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 91.39 – This extremely high RSI suggests the stock is overbought and potentially due for a correction.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.96 – A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +20.68 –  Shows a recent period of strong upward movement.
* **Expected Return:** 5.25% – This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) excess return over the S&P 500 if investing through regular contributions.  This should be considered cautiously as it is just an estimate.  The overbought RSI condition needs to be factored in.  The recent jump from $884.92 to $897.79 suggests a short-term price surge, possibly driven by recent news or market sentiment.  This rapid increase should be viewed with caution due to the potential for a subsequent pullback.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show generally increasing revenue and profits,  although there is some quarter-to-quarter variation.  Missing expected values prevent a full analysis of the latest earnings announcement, highlighting the importance of supplementing this data with information from official sources.  The data shows a clear upward trend, but more detailed analysis would require more information (including comparison to analyst expectations).

**5.  Quarterly Financial Data Analysis (Revenue and Profitability):**

Revenue shows consistent growth over the periods reported. Profit margins are also healthy, with some fluctuation.  A deeper dive into the financial statements would reveal more about the drivers of profitability.

**Quarterly Financial Data Analysis (Capital and Profitability):**

Equity is generally increasing. ROE (Return on Equity) shows fluctuations, indicating variability in profitability relative to invested capital. Again, more detailed financial information is needed for a complete assessment.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires access to real-time news sources.  Please provide recent news articles (from Shacknews, FINBOLD, etc.) for a complete analysis.  Without access to these sources, this section cannot be completed.)*  I need specific news articles to comment on recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix demonstrates strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Recent price action shows a strong upward trend, but technical indicators suggest the stock may be overbought.  Financial performance shows generally increasing revenue and profits.  However, the overbought RSI and recent price surge warrant caution.  Further analysis is required using up-to-date news and complete earnings reports (including expected values) to adequately assess current market sentiment and risk. The high beta suggests higher volatility compared to the market, meaning bigger potential gains but also bigger potential losses.  The long-term outlook remains positive based on historical performance and current financial indicators, but the short-term picture carries significant uncertainty due to potential correction after the recent price surge.
