## Netflix Inc. (NFLX) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Netflix, a leading global entertainment company providing streaming services, has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The substantial difference in cumulative returns warrants a deeper investigation into the drivers of this performance.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison & Divergence:**

* **NFLX Cumulative Return:** 271.90%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 87.98%
* **Return Divergence:** 183.9% (representing a substantial outperformance of NFLX relative to the market).
* **Relative Divergence (percentile):** 82.4%. This indicates that the current performance difference lies at the 82.4th percentile of the historical range of divergence between NFLX and VOO, suggesting a relatively high level of outperformance compared to past observations.  It does *not* imply a guaranteed continuation of this outperformance.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows periods of significant outperformance (high Alpha values) and underperformance (negative Alpha values) relative to the market. Beta values generally indicate that NFLX is more volatile than the market (Beta > 1), especially during periods of high Alpha. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth over time.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying drivers of this volatility and the fluctuations in alpha.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $1144.43
* **Last Market Price:** $1140.22 (a minor decrease of $0.37 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $1145.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $1059.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $990.03

The stock price is currently slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting some minor short-term downward pressure, but significantly above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a positive longer-term trend.  The recent small price drop (-0.37) doesn't indicate a significant event on its own.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 85.98 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction)
* **PPO:** 0.54 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.6 (Positive, short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 19.2% (This represents an expected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term).

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to a correction. However, the positive PPO and the short-term upward trend suggest continued bullish momentum in the near term. The high expected return highlights the potential for substantial gains over the long term, contingent upon the continuation of positive performance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, although this outperformance shows considerable volatility over time.  While recent price action suggests some potential for near-term correction due to an overbought condition (RSI), the positive long-term growth in revenue, earnings, and equity, coupled with a positive outlook for future returns, points to a potentially strong investment opportunity, especially for a long-term investor.  However, it's crucial to monitor the market risk indicators, understand the drivers of past volatility, and be mindful of the potential for price corrections given the current overbought condition.  Further investigation is warranted into the potential data error in the earnings report and the sources of variability in Alpha and Beta.
