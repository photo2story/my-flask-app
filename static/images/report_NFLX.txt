The cumulative return of NFLX is 341.37%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.78%. The difference is 219.6%, placing it in the 92.9th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates a strong historical outperformance.

* **Closing Price:** $921.08
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $923.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $899.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $797.79

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting some recent minor price correction.  However, it is significantly above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 70.76 (Approaching overbought territory)

However, the positive relative strength and high projected long-term returns indicate continued potential for growth.  The current price of $921.08, given the context of recent moving averages, doesn't suggest extreme volatility (neither a sharp upturn nor a downturn), but rather a period of consolidation after a recent strong rally.
