**Analysis:**

*   The hybrid signal recommends buying based on the oversold condition.
*   The change in relative divergence indicates a short-term decline.
*   The exceptionally high expected return should be viewed with extreme caution. It is likely based on a model that assumes a significant recovery from the current depressed levels and is not a guarantee of future performance.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

The recent news headlines heavily focus on a 10-for-1 stock split and its implications. The articles discuss whether the split makes the stock a buy, compare it to competitors like Disney and Alphabet, and analyze its valuation post-split.

**Analysis:**  Despite the recent negative performance, analysts generally have a "Buy" rating on the stock with an average target price significantly higher than the current price. This suggests analysts believe the stock is undervalued and has the potential for future growth. However, it's important to note the wide range in target prices, indicating some disagreement among analysts. The lack of recent rating changes further suggests a possible need for revision, given recent performance.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Netflix (NFLX) is currently facing a complex situation. While it exhibits positive growth in revenue and earnings, its stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, reflected in the large divergence and negative alpha. The stock appears to be oversold, according to the RSI, potentially signaling a short-term buying opportunity. Analyst consensus remains positive, with a "Buy" rating and a higher average target price, suggesting belief in the company's long-term potential. The recent stock split has created uncertainty, but underlying financials, such as increasing revenue and healthy profit margins, paint a positive picture. However, the recent history of large drawdowns indicates that volatility is very high. The extremely high 'Expected Return' should be regarded with significant skepticism.

**In conclusion:** NFLX presents a mixed bag.  There's potential for a rebound based on oversold conditions and analyst sentiment, but the company's recent underperformance, high volatility, and the uncertainty surrounding the stock split warrant careful consideration. Investors should weigh the potential upside against the considerable risks before making any investment decisions.
