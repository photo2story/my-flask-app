| 2023-2025  | -117.0%| 90.4% | -184.0%| 0.6   | 398.9  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate has fluctuated wildly, with significant positive growth in some periods and massive negative growth in others.  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a substantial decline.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha, which measures performance relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500), is largely negative in recent years, indicating underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta, measuring volatility relative to the market, has increased in recent years, suggesting Netflix's stock has become more sensitive to overall market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** This likely refers to Market capitalization in billions of dollars. There is significant fluctuation.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 94.47
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 94.15
    *   Previous Close: 94.47
    *   Change: -0.34
*   **5-day SMA:** 93.846
*   **20-day SMA:** 97.3445
*   **60-day SMA:** 660.7287 (This number is extremely high and is probably incorrect. This is an anomaly and should be disregarded for analysis.)

**Analysis:** The stock price has experienced a slight decrease recently. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which *could* suggest a short-term downward trend (though further analysis is needed for confirmation, especially without a valid 60-day SMA).

**3) Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 32.00 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** 2.60 (Potentially Overbought)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Oversold Boost - MRI: 0.80)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4778.7%

**Analysis:**

*   The high MRI suggests the system considers the stock to be a good investment despite current volatility.
*   The RSI is near oversold territory, suggesting the stock *might* be due for a bounce.
*   The PPO seems to contradict the RSI. Further analysis is necessary.
*   The "Buy" signal is driven by the oversold condition and the moderate MRI.
*   The significant negative change in divergence over the last 20 days confirms a recent downward trend.
*   The extremely high Expected Return should be viewed with skepticism. It's likely based on a model that's projecting a significant recovery, but it's not a guarantee.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news articles present a mixed picture. Some suggest Netflix is becoming interesting due to being out of favor, while others discuss buy/sell/hold recommendations. Some articles mention "Warner deal" which may or may not be related to the valuation. Finally, other articles suggest that Netflix is a best quality stock to buy before 2026.

**Analysis:** The news highlights the current uncertainty surrounding Netflix. There's no clear consensus on the stock's future performance.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.95)
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 126.19 / High: 152.50 / Low: 77.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not provided.

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" recommendation and a target price significantly higher than the current price. However, there's a wide range in target prices, reflecting the uncertainty. The absence of recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess the current momentum of analyst sentiment.

*   **Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in Netflix at this point presents both risks and potential rewards. The current price may be attractive if the company can turn things around. However, the high volatility and recent underperformance necessitate careful risk management. The extremely high "Expected Return" should not be the sole basis for an investment decision. A potential investor needs to weigh the positive factors (analyst optimism, financial strength) against the negative factors (underperformance, volatility, mixed technical signals) and conduct further due diligence before investing.
