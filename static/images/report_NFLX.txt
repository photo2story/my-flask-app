However, the oversold RSI, the positive analyst sentiment, and the solid revenue growth suggest a potential for future recovery. The extremely high expected return should be viewed skeptically without further context on how it was calculated. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions regarding NFLX. The volatility shown and the high drawdowns should be taken very seriously.
