**5. Financial Information:**

No "Total Revenue" or "Gross Profit" data is available.  Further financial statement analysis is required for a comprehensive assessment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix shows impressive long-term cumulative returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500. However, high volatility and recent overbought conditions (RSI) suggest caution. The positive PPO and upward price trend relative to moving averages indicate bullish momentum.  Earnings show increasing revenue but fluctuating EPS. The lack of detailed financial data limits a deeper analysis of profitability and valuation.  A long-term investment perspective might be appropriate, given the expected 10.1% excess return, but investors should monitor technical indicators and earnings reports closely for potential corrections. The significant volatility should be carefully considered.  Further investigation into the discrepancies in the provided data (duplicate earnings entry, missing financial statements) is necessary.
