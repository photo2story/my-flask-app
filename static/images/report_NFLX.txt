| 2023-2025  | -117.0%   | 90.4% | -184.0% | 0.6   | 400.3    |

*   **CAGR:** Volatile.  High growth early on, followed by significant declines, and a very large negative CAGR in the most recent period.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High, indicating significant potential losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:**  Shows periods of outperformance early on, but significant underperformance in more recent years.  Large negative Alpha values indicate NFLX is not generating expected returns given its risk.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, indicating NFLX's price is not very correlated to the S&P 500 index. In recent years it has been higher (1.0 and 1.6).
*   **Cap(B):** Market cap fluctates but stays elevated.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 94.47
*   **Last Market Change:** Price: 94.47, Previous Close: 93.64, Change: 0.89
*   **5-day SMA:** 93.846
*   **20-day SMA:** 97.3445
*   **60-day SMA:** 660.7287

*   **Analysis:** The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which indicates a short-term downtrend.  The massive divergence between the 20-day SMA and the 60-day SMA indicates a significant and sustained decline in the stock price over the last 60 days. The recent daily change of 0.89 is not extreme, but should be considered.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Other Indicators:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 32.00 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** 2.60
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Safe (OverSold Boost) - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-22)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.1 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 4778.7 (Expected Excess Return compared to S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   An RSI of 32.00 suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity (rebound expected).
    *   The PPO indicates the price is trending.
    *   The Hybrid Signal suggests a full allocation of cash to buying shares, influenced by the oversold condition and an MRI indicating a favorable risk environment.
    *   The negative divergence change confirms the recent downward trend.
    *   The very high Expected Return should be viewed with extreme caution. It's likely an artifact of the recent price decline and may not be realistic.
    *   The MRI is 1.0 which contradicts the recent decline.

    *   **Warner Bros. Discovery Deal/Takeover Rumors:**  A major focus of the news, with speculation about Netflix being acquired or impacted by Warner Bros. Discovery.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Summary:** Netflix is facing a complex situation. While revenue and equity are growing, the stock price has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The news flow is dominated by speculation, creating uncertainty.
*   **Positive Signals:** Analyst consensus is "Buy," RSI suggests an oversold condition, and revenue is increasing.
*   **Negative Signals:** Significant underperformance vs. the S&P 500, recent downward price trend, and potential Warner Bros. Discovery deal causing uncertainty.
*   **Concerns:** The massive decline in the stock price has significantly lowered the 60-day SMA, The very high "Expected Return" figure is likely unreliable and should be disregarded. Profit Margin and ROE are fluctuating and warrant further monitoring.
*   **Recommendation:** Given the mixed signals, potential investors should proceed with extreme caution. It's important to do further due diligence, including a deeper dive into the reasons behind the recent price decline, the potential impact of the Warner Bros. Discovery deal, and the reasons behind the fluctuations in profit margin and ROE. While the oversold condition and analyst ratings suggest a potential rebound, the risks are substantial. A small, speculative position *might* be considered, but a large investment is not warranted at this time.
