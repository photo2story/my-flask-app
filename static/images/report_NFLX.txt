**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires access to recent news articles from sources like Shacknews and Finbold.  Please provide links to relevant articles for a complete analysis.)*  I need specific news articles to summarize recent news and analyst opinions.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix shows strong growth and outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, the high RSI suggests an overbought condition, and a short-term correction is possible.  The recent strong price increase warrants caution. Long-term prospects look positive given consistent revenue growth and generally healthy profit margins, but potential short-term volatility should be considered.  The analysis is incomplete without the specifics of recent earnings calls, analyst reports, and news articles.  The expected return of 5.25% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a positive indicator, but relies on continued growth and market conditions.
