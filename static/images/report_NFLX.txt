**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $934.74 (Last Market: $934.84)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $912.72
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $868.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $775.57

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.  The relatively large gap between the closing price and the 60-day MA indicates a recent price surge.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (81.62):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction could be imminent.
* **PPO (0.13):**  A positive PPO suggests a bullish momentum, but the relatively low value might indicate weakening momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (6.3, +):**  Shows a positive short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (86.8%):** This represents a significant expected return over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) with continued investment. Given the high RSI,  this prediction requires careful consideration, as a correction could impact returns. The recent sharp rise (implied by the large gap between closing price and 60-day MA) could be partially responsible for the high expected return, which may not be sustainable.
