**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-18 | 5.52   | 9.82 B$       |
| 2024-07-19 | 4.99   | 9.56 B$       |
| 2024-04-22 | 5.4    | 9.37 B$       |

Revenue shows a generally increasing trend. EPS shows some fluctuation but also a generally increasing trend (excluding the duplicate entry).  Further analysis would benefit from more complete and accurate data.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This information is crucial for assessing profitability and overall financial health.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Netflix exhibits strong historical performance significantly exceeding the S&P 500.  However, current indicators (high RSI, recent price decline) suggest a potential short-term correction.  The long-term outlook, given the expected 10.1% outperformance, remains positive, provided the company sustains its growth trajectory.  However, a comprehensive analysis requires more complete financial data (especially total revenue and gross profit), allowing for a deeper evaluation of the company's financial health and sustainability. The high relative divergence also warrants caution, acknowledging the potential for a reversion to the mean.
