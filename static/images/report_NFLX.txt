**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Netflix shows a history of strong growth and significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent performance indicates high volatility and a potential downtrend.  The oversold RSI suggests a possible bounce, but the negative PPO and price action below moving averages suggest caution.  While the long-term expected return is positive, the significant risk associated with this volatility should be considered.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price decline and the duplicate entry in the earnings data is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Investors should carefully weigh the potential for high returns against the substantial risk.
