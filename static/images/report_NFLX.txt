*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuates significantly, showing periods of high growth (e.g., 2022-2024) and contraction (e.g., 2020-2022).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates potential risk.  Drawdowns have been significant, suggesting volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Measures outperformance relative to a benchmark.  The negative alpha in several periods suggests underperformance during those times. The recent alpha is high, suggesting outperformance relative to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Measures volatility relative to the market.  A beta around 1 suggests volatility similar to the market, while betas above 1 suggest higher volatility.  Netflix tends to be slightly more volatile than the market, but this fluctuates.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in billions. Shows strong growth over the periods analyzed.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 91.46

*   **Change:** 0.52
*   **5-day SMA:** 93.43
*   **20-day SMA:** 94.8995
*   **60-day SMA:** 106.7789

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is below all moving averages, suggesting a recent downtrend. The 5-day SMA is closest to the current price, while the 60-day SMA is significantly higher, further confirming the downtrend. The small increase in the last market day ({'price': 91.46, 'previousClose': 90.99, 'change': 0.52}) may indicate a very short-term rebound, but it doesn't negate the overall downward momentum.
