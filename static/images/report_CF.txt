CF Industries is a profitable company in a favorable industry with strong demand fundamentals. However, its stock price has been underperforming compared to the broader market, as reflected by its relative performance against VOO. While recent price action is positive, the near-term outlook suggests a potential pullback due to elevated RSI and recent downward trend in relative divergence. Longer-term outlook remains positive based on the company's robust fundamentals and strong earnings performance.  Investors should monitor the stock closely for potential short-term volatility but consider holding for the longer term based on its attractive expected return.
