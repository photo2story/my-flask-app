The relative divergence of 85.39% indicates that TJX's performance has been significantly stronger than the S&P 500 over the period considered, placing it in the top 85.39% of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this is a relative measure and doesn't guarantee future outperformance.

* **Expected Return:** 4.25% - This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment.  The current price of $119.57 does not appear to indicate a dramatic recent surge (neither a sharp upturn nor a steep decline) based on the other provided data.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS data shows consistent outperformance against expectations. The most recent quarter (2024-08-21) reported EPS of $0.96, exceeding the expected $0.92.  This positive trend suggests strong financial health and market confidence. However, a single quarterâ€™s performance doesn't guarantee future profitability.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue remains strong and relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating consistent performance. Profit margins have fluctuated slightly but remain healthy, around 30%.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been growing steadily, and ROE (Return on Equity) has shown some volatility but generally remains in a positive and acceptable range for the industry.  The high ROE in 2024-01-31 might be worth investigating to determine if it's a sustainable trend or a one-off event.

TJX shows strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  Recent financial results have been positive, exceeding expectations.

The long-term outlook, based on the provided expected return, appears positive relative to the S&P 500.  However,  investors should consider the inherent risks involved in any stock investment.  The 4.25% expected return is only a projection and should not be interpreted as a guaranteed return.
