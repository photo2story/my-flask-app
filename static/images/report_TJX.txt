TJX has outperformed the S&P 500 by a significant margin, with a cumulative return exceeding that of VOO by 52.31%. This suggests that TJX has been a strong performer historically, even during periods of market volatility.

The recent price movement suggests a sideways trend. The stock is currently trading slightly above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but below its 60-day moving average.
