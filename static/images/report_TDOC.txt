The high beta values in earlier years suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The significantly negative alphas and CAGRs in recent years confirm substantial underperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $14.33
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $13.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $11.20
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $10.45

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent price increase. However, the relatively large gaps between the current price and the moving averages suggest potential for a correction.  The price shows a recent 6.07% increase from the previous close, indicating a sharp, potentially unsustainable, upward movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 76.82  (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.)
* **PPO:** 2.87 (Positive, indicating upward momentum, but high RSI suggests caution.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.2 (+) (Short-term upward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** -3686.5% (This extremely negative figure strongly suggests significant downside risk over the long term relative to the S&P 500.)  This should be treated with caution as this is a projection based on historical data and may not be accurate.

The sharp price increase (6.07%) warrants caution. The combination of overbought RSI and a very negative projected return indicates a high risk of significant future losses relative to the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS       | Revenue     |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19    | $0.64B      |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92    | $0.64B      |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49    | $0.65B      |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35    | $0.66B      |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35    | $0.66B      |

The company is consistently reporting negative EPS, raising serious concerns about its profitability and sustainability. Revenue has remained relatively stable, but without profitability, this is not positive.  The large negative EPS in August 2024 is particularly concerning.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $0.64B      | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.64B      | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.65B      | 69.89%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.66B      | 70.72%        |
| 2023-09-30  | $0.66B      | 71.83%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE          |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $1.51B      | -2.21%       |
| 2024-06-30  | $1.50B      | -55.77%      |
| 2024-03-31  | $2.29B      | -3.58%       |
| 2023-12-31  | $2.33B      | -1.24%       |
| 2023-09-30  | $2.29B      | -2.49%       |

While revenue remains relatively consistent, the negative ROE across all quarters indicates the company is not generating returns on its equity.  The significantly negative ROE in Q2 2024 is particularly alarming.  Profit margins appear strong but are likely misleading given the negative EPS and ROE.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance is severely lagging the S&P 500, showing a substantial negative return.  Technical indicators suggest an overbought market and potential for a correction.  Negative EPS and ROE figures raise serious concerns about the company's financial health and long-term sustainability.  The recent sharp price increase may be unsustainable.  While revenue remains relatively stable, the lack of profitability and the highly negative projected long-term return relative to the market strongly suggest a high-risk investment.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative EPS and ROE is crucial before considering any investment.
