**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 14.71 (Suggests oversold conditions, but in the context of the overall trend, this might not signal a strong buy signal)
* **PPO:** -3.59 (Negative value reinforces the downtrend.)

* **Expected Return:** -5291.6% (This extremely negative value highlights significant risk and strongly suggests substantial potential for further losses, especially in the short term.  The long-term potential for outperforming the S&P 500 is highly unlikely given the current situation.)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue    |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19   | $0.64 B    |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92   | $0.64 B    |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49   | $0.65 B    |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35   | $0.66 B    |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35   | $0.66 B    |

Consistent negative EPS figures indicate significant losses. While revenue remains relatively stable, the company's profitability is severely lacking.  The large negative EPS in August 2024 is particularly concerning.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $0.64B     | 70.50%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.64B     | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.64B     | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.65B     | 69.89%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.66B     | 70.72%        |

Revenue is relatively flat.  The profit margin is high, but this is misleading given the extremely negative EPS numbers.  Further investigation into the calculation of profit margin is necessary.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE         |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $1.49B     | -3.25%      |
| 2024-09-30  | $1.51B     | -2.21%      |
| 2024-06-30  | $1.50B     | -55.77%     |
| 2024-03-31  | $2.29B     | -3.58%      |
| 2023-12-31  | $2.33B     | -1.24%      |

Negative ROE across all recent quarters demonstrates the company's inability to generate profits on its equity.  The significant drop in equity in Q2 2024 is alarming.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC exhibits extremely poor performance relative to the S&P 500, with consistent negative returns in recent years. While some technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, the fundamental indicators (negative EPS, negative ROE, shrinking equity) paint a dire picture.  The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.  The company's high profit margin needs further investigation as it appears inconsistent with its negative EPS.  At present, TDOC presents a very high-risk investment with little indication of near-term recovery.  A long-term investment would require a significant turnaround in the company's fundamentals and would not be recommended based on current data.
