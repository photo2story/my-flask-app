| 2023-2025  | -34.0%  | 81.6%  | -100.0% | -0.8   | 1.4    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Early Growth (2015-2020):** High CAGRs and positive Alphas indicate strong outperformance relative to the market. Beta was low (even negative), suggesting low correlation with the market. This implies the stock's performance was driven by factors other than the overall market trend. The negative beta may be spurious given the strong positive returns during these periods.
*   **Significant Decline (2019-Present):** The negative CAGRs and Alphas signify substantial underperformance. Beta turned negative and increasingly more negative, implying an inverse relationship with the market. The sharp decline suggests company-specific issues outweighing general market trends. Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is high, reflecting significant peak-to-trough declines in the investment value. Market Cap has decreased significantly from 36B to 1.4B.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **5-day SMA:** 7.498
*   **20-day SMA:** 7.3225
*   **60-day SMA:** 8.0027

**Analysis:**  The price is currently slightly above the 5-day and 20-day SMAs but below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term uptrend but a longer-term downtrend. The change of -1.93% in the last market indicates recent price weakness.
