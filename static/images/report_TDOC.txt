| 2023-2025  | -35.0%  | 81.6%  | -101.0% | -0.8   | 1.3    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows high growth in earlier periods (2015-2020), followed by significant negative growth in recent periods (2019-2025).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha, which measures performance relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500), is strongly positive in the earlier periods but has turned sharply negative in recent years, indicating substantial underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta, measuring volatility relative to the market, has fluctuated.  Negative beta values suggest that the stock price tends to move in the opposite direction of the market, or is less sensitive to market movements.  The recent negative beta values could indicate a defensive characteristic, but combined with the high MDD and negative Alpha, it's more likely due to company-specific struggles.
*   **Cap(B):**  Market capitalization has decreased significantly in recent years, suggesting a loss of investor confidence.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 7.23

*   **Change:** 1.26%
*   **5-day SMA:** 7.274
*   **20-day SMA:** 7.4435
*   **60-day SMA:** 7.9054

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This suggests a short-term downtrend. The recent price increase of 1.26% is a positive sign, but the price still needs to break above these moving averages to confirm a potential trend reversal.

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 39.19
*   **PPO:** -0.1761
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (132 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.3 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10382.5%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.7 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, but this should be viewed cautiously in conjunction with the other indicators.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 39.19 suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, which *could* indicate a potential buying opportunity but shouldn't be used in isolation.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of -0.1761 suggests the stock is in a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends buying, it's labeled "Very Safe", and has a MRI of 0.9.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence indicates continued short-term negative momentum.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-10382.5%) is highly concerning and suggests significant risks associated with a long-term investment at the current price.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Articles:** Some articles suggest potential undervaluation ("Bargain After a 96% Slide") or assess a recent rebound.
*   **Neutral Articles:** A consensus rating of "Hold" from brokerages.
*   **Negative Articles:** Insider sales (CLO and President of BetterHelp selling shares).

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. There are some articles suggesting potential undervaluation and recovery, but insider sales and a "Hold" consensus from analysts indicate caution.

*   **Target Price:** Average target price of $9.18 (High: $12.00, Low: $7.00).
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent rating changes are listed.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is a "Hold," suggesting no strong conviction to either buy or sell. The average target price ($9.18) is higher than the current price, suggesting potential upside, but the low target price ($7.00) is near the current price, indicating some analysts see limited potential.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**Analysis:** Teladoc has consistently reported negative EPS, indicating a lack of profitability. Revenue has been relatively stable around $0.63-0.64 billion. The repeated date 2025-10-30 is suspicious.

*   **Negative Momentum:** The technical indicators (SMAs, RSI, PPO) suggest a downtrend.
