* **20-Day Moving Average:** $10.33

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend, although the recent movement needs more observation.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (64.51):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (0.05):** A slightly positive value suggests potential upward momentum, but it's relatively weak.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (-0.5):** Shows a short-term decline in relative strength compared to the benchmark.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided data suggests no expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) at the current valuation.  This is consistent with the substantial underperformance observed. The $11.0 price doesn't indicate a sudden sharp upward or downward movement, given the context of the moving averages.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a concerning trend:

* **Revenue:** Revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64 - $0.66B across the reported quarters, indicating a lack of significant revenue growth.
* **EPS:** EPS has been consistently negative, with significant losses reported in multiple quarters, including a particularly large loss of -$4.92 in Q2 2024. There is no clear improvement in EPS trends.
* **Comparison:** There's no clear pattern of improvement across quarters.  The company is losing money consistently and revenue has not shown a clear increase to offset the losses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** While revenue is relatively stable, profit margins are high (70-72%), seemingly at odds with the negative EPS.  This discrepancy requires further investigation into the accounting practices and potential one-time costs which may be masking ongoing losses.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has fluctuated, and ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on shareholder equity.  The substantial negative ROE across multiple quarters is a major red flag.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**  (This section requires additional information.  No recent earnings news or market outlook/analyst opinions are provided.)

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Teladoc Health is currently experiencing significant financial challenges. While revenue has remained relatively stable, consistent negative EPS and negative ROE indicate a severe lack of profitability.  The stock's considerable underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the neutral technical indicators suggest a cautious outlook.  The high profit margins despite negative EPS are very strange and need clarifying.  Further investigation into the company's financial statements and business model is crucial before considering any investment.  The current data suggests a high-risk investment with no clear indication of future improvement based on recent performance.
