| 2024-10-31   | -0.35    | $0.66 B      |

| Quarter      | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31   | $0.64B      | 70.50%        |

| 2024-03-31   | $0.65B      | 69.89%        |

| 2024-12-31   | $1.49B      | -3.25%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $1.51B      | -2.21%        |
| 2024-06-30   | $1.50B      | -55.77%       |
| 2024-03-31   | $2.29B      | -3.58%        |
| 2023-12-31   | $2.33B      | -1.24%        |


While revenue remains relatively stable, the negative and volatile ROE is a significant concern, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  The extremely negative ROE in Q2 2024 warrants further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC exhibits extreme underperformance against the S&P 500, reflected in significantly negative cumulative returns and consistently negative alpha.  Technical indicators point towards a bearish trend, with the stock trading below key moving averages and showing over sold conditions (RSI).  Negative earnings and volatile, predominantly negative ROE highlight significant financial challenges. While revenue shows some stability, the company's inability to translate this into positive profits raises serious concerns about its long-term viability.  The extremely negative expected return strongly advises against any investment unless significant improvements in the company's fundamentals are observed.  A long-term investment strategy with TDOC at this time would be exceptionally high risk.
