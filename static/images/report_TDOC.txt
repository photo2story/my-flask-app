**Company Overview:** Teladoc Health Inc. is a telehealth company providing virtual care services.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows highly volatile performance, with significant swings in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  The alpha consistently remains near zero, suggesting that the company's returns are largely explained by market movements. The beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to overall market trends. The substantial decrease in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the years is a critical observation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $9.82
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $9.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.78

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, and very close to the 60-day moving average, suggesting a relatively stable short-term trend but the long-term trend is bearish.  There's no indication of a recent sharp uptrend or downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 56.16 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral sentiment.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.46 – A positive value suggests a potential bullish momentum, but the magnitude is relatively low.

* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +0.2 – A positive change indicates a short-term upward trend.

* **Expected Return:** -5431.9% – This extremely negative expected return highlights significant risk and potential for further losses.  This is likely a reflection of the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and needs further investigation regarding the calculation methodology.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy may need to account for the volatility and uncertainty associated with this significantly negative expectation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows consistent losses (negative EPS). The August 2024 quarter shows an exceptionally large loss which needs further investigation to determine if it represents an anomaly or indicative of a more serious problem. Revenue remains relatively stable.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively consistent across quarters. However, the reported Profit Margin is extremely high and counterintuitive given the negative EPS reported in the same period. There is a significant discrepancy between the high profit margins and the consistently negative EPS values that requires clarification and further investigation.  There's possibly a problem with data reporting or calculation methodology.

**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity fluctuates, and Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating poor profitability and potential issues with the company's financial health.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility and consistent losses.  The high profit margin reported in the Revenue and Profitability section is highly inconsistent with the negative EPS and ROE reported across quarters, requiring immediate reconciliation and explanation.  The extremely negative expected return (-5431.9%) raises major concerns.  Before considering any long-term investment, a thorough investigation into the financial statements, including a detailed breakdown of reported profit margins vs earnings per share, is crucial.  The data provided suggests substantial risk, making TDOC a potentially high-risk investment. Further research and due diligence are strongly recommended before any investment decision.  The data inconsistencies necessitate seeking clarification from official financial reports.
