**0. Key Figures Summary:**

TDOC's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price action shows a downtrend, with the price below all three moving averages.  Financial indicators reveal mixed signals, with a low RSI suggesting oversold conditions, but negative PPO and a large negative expected return indicating bearish sentiment.


**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) is a telehealth provider offering virtual care services.

* **TDOC Cumulative Return:** -71.94%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 85.44%
* **Return Difference:** -157.4%  (This means TDOC underperformed VOO by 157.4 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -2.7 indicates its position near the lower end of historical performance relative to the S&P 500.)

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows high volatility and significant negative returns in recent years, particularly since 2019.  While earlier periods showed high growth (and high beta), the recent trend is starkly negative.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $7.53
* **Previous Close:** $7.79
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $7.83
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $8.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $10.02

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The recent price drop of -3.34% shows a notable negative movement, although not necessarily a "crash" level of decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.43 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 32.7 (Oversold territory; below 30 typically signals oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.45 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.7 (Short-term upward movement, but within a larger bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** -3342.3% (This extremely negative figure suggests a very low probability of significant positive returns in the short term. It needs to be interpreted cautiously, and may not be an accurate indicator due to underlying assumptions not known.)


The significant negative change (-3.34%) from the previous close indicates a recent price drop, reflecting current market sentiment.  The high negative expected return aligns with this bearish sentiment. Long-term investment requires careful consideration of the substantial risks involved.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19  | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92  | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49  | $0.65 B      |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35  | $0.66 B      |
| 2023-10-31 | -$0.35  | $0.66 B      |

The company consistently reported negative EPS over the provided period, although revenue remains relatively stable.  The substantial negative EPS in August 2024 is particularly concerning.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B   | 70.50%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B   | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B   | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B   | 69.89%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B   | 70.72%        |

Revenue is relatively flat, and Profit Margin remains consistently high. This contrasts sharply with the negative EPS.  There's a mismatch that needs further investigation.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE          |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B   | -3.25%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B   | -2.21%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B   | -55.77%      |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B   | -3.58%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B   | -1.24%       |

Negative ROE across all quarters indicates the company is not generating returns on shareholder equity. The extremely negative ROE in Q2 2024 is a significant concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is currently facing significant challenges. While the company maintains relatively stable revenue and high profit margins,  it's consistently reporting negative EPS and ROE. The stock price is significantly underperforming the market, and technical indicators suggest bearish sentiment. The extremely negative expected return highlights the substantial risk involved in investing in TDOC at this time.  Further investigation into the cause of the discrepancy between high profit margins and negative EPS is crucial.  A thorough analysis of the company's business model, competitive landscape, and future prospects is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The current data suggests a high level of risk.
