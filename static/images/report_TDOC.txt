The significant negative CAGR and Alpha values in recent years (2020-2025) point to considerable underperformance compared to the market benchmark.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The recent price action shows a significant short-term increase.  The current price ($13.86) is above both the 5-day ($12.04), 20-day ($10.40), and 60-day ($10.18) moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend. However, this needs to be viewed in context of the larger downward trend displayed by the longer-term CAGR values and relative divergence data.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (90.37):** Extremely overbought, indicating a high probability of a price correction.
* **PPO (3.57):** Suggests bullish momentum, but should be interpreted cautiously given the overbought RSI.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+1.2):** Shows short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (-3611.7%):** This extremely negative expected return highlights significant risk associated with the stock and suggests serious concern for future returns.  The short term price increase should not mask the fundamental problems apparent from this and other indicators.


The recent price increase of 7.03% is a significant short-term upward move, potentially representing a temporary bounce rather than a sustained reversal of the overall bearish trend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue     |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19    | $0.64 B     |
| 2024-08-01 | -4.92    | $0.64 B     |
| 2024-04-26 | -0.49    | $0.65 B     |
| 2023-10-27 | -0.35    | $0.66 B     |
| 2024-10-31 | -0.35    | $0.66 B     |

Consistent negative EPS over multiple quarters demonstrates significant profitability issues. Although revenue has remained relatively stable, the inability to translate this into profit is a major concern.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $0.64B     | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.64B     | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.65B     | 69.89%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $0.66B     | 70.72%        |
| 2023-09-30  | $0.66B     | 71.83%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE          |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $1.51B     | -2.21%       |
| 2024-06-30  | $1.50B     | -55.77%      |
| 2024-03-31  | $2.29B     | -3.58%       |
| 2023-12-31  | $2.33B     | -1.24%       |
| 2023-09-30  | $2.29B     | -2.49%       |

High profit margins are offset by negative ROE, signifying a critical issue with the company's capital efficiency and return on investment.  While revenue remains relatively stable, the consistent negative ROE across multiple quarters is a serious cause for concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC has exhibited significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with considerable negative returns in recent years. While there has been a recent short-term price increase, technical indicators (overbought RSI) and fundamental analysis (negative EPS and ROE) paint a bleak picture. The extremely negative expected return strongly cautions against long-term investment. The company's financial health is questionable due to persistent negative earnings despite relatively stable revenue.   A long-term (2+ years) investment in TDOC carries substantial risk and is likely to underperform the S&P 500 significantly based on the current data.  Further due diligence and careful consideration of risk tolerance are crucial before any investment decisions.
