*   **Overall Assessment:** Based on the provided data, TDOC appears to be a high-risk investment. The company needs to address its profitability issues and demonstrate a clear path to sustainable growth.

**Recommendation:** A potential investor should exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in TDOC. Careful monitoring of the company's financial performance and strategic initiatives will be crucial to determine if the company can turn around its current trajectory. The negative expected return and concerns about profitability suggest that there are likely better investment opportunities available elsewhere.
