*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, suggesting TDOC's price is not strongly correlated with the market. The negative betas in later years indicate that TDOC has, at times, moved inversely to the market.

*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $7.7576

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages but above the 20-day moving average. The recent negative price change indicates a slight downward trend, but no extreme move. The difference between the closing price and the previous close price is minimal, which means there aren't any rapid price fluctuations.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3233 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 50.0 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.1134 (Positive, but close to zero)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33)
*   **20-Day Relative Disparity Change:** -0.4 (Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** -10277.7%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a low-risk environment.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 50 indicates a neutral position, with no clear overbought or oversold condition.
*   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO suggests a minor upward trend, but the value is close to zero, indicating weak momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests using 80% of your cash to buy 1 share, but it's marked with caution due to the MRI level. This might imply a weak buy signal.
*   **Relative Disparity Change:** A negative change in relative disparity suggests short-term underperformance compared to the benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The dramatically negative expected return (-10277.7%) should be viewed with extreme skepticism. This likely stems from the model extrapolating recent underperformance far into the future. It's an unrealistic figure, but it highlights the model's expectation of continued relative underperformance.
