    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD values indicate significant volatility and risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Positive alpha in earlier periods indicated outperformance relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark.  However, alpha has become strongly negative, signifying underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuate, but are largely negative, suggesting TDOC has historically been less correlated with the market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** 8.53
*   **Previous Close:** 9.02
*   **Change:** -5.43% (Significant drop)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 8.734
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 8.389
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 7.8147

*   **Analysis:** The stock experienced a notable drop (-5.43%) from the previous close.  The price is currently below the 5-day moving average but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend following a longer-term upward trend. The price drop should be investigated further for specific company-related or market-related catalysts.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5 (Low Investment - indicates it is very risky)
*   **RSI:** 56.40 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.26 (Positive - suggests a slightly positive trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (110 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Spread Change (20-day):** 1.0 (Positive - short-term increase in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return:** -5551.4% (Significantly negative - indicates very poor expected long-term performance relative to the S&P 500).

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests low investment recommendation based on the risk assessment. The RSI is neutral. The PPO indicates a slightly positive trend, which is contradictory to the negative expected return and recent price drop. The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, although the MRI of 0.90 associated with the recommendation does not reflect the current MRI. The large negative "Expected Return" figure is concerning and warrants further investigation. The recent positive change in relative spread suggests short-term improvement compared to the S&P 500, but this is overshadowed by the overall negative outlook.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue   |
| :----------- | :--- | :-------- |
| 2025-07-30 | -0.19 | 0.63 B$ |
| 2025-05-01 | -0.53 | 0.63 B$ |
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19 | 0.64 B$ |
| 2024-08-01 | -4.92 | 0.64 B$ |
| 2025-07-30 | -4.92 | 0.64 B$ |

*   **Analysis:**  EPS (Earnings Per Share) is consistently negative, indicating a lack of profitability. Revenue has remained relatively stable around $0.63-0.64 billion, but this has not translated into positive earnings. The large negative EPS figures in 2024-08-01 and 2025-07-30 are concerning and need further investigation.

**6. Financial Information (Revenue, Profitability, Capital)**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue | Profit Margin |
| :----------- | :------ | :------------ |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.63B | 69.85%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.63B | 68.73%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B | 70.50%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity  | ROE        |
| :----------- | :------ | :--------- |
| 2025-06-30 | $1.42B | -2.30%     |
| 2025-03-31 | $1.43B | -6.52%     |
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B | -3.25%     |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77%    |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue is stable, and profit margins are relatively high. However, negative ROE (Return on Equity) indicates that the company is not generating profits from shareholder equity. The significant drop in ROE in 2024-06-30 warrants further examination. Equity has been decreasing slightly over the past few quarters.

**7. Overall Analysis & Conclusion**

TDOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and faces several challenges:

*   **Poor Historical Performance:** Negative cumulative return and negative alpha values highlight long-term underperformance.
*   **Recent Price Weakness:**  The recent price drop and negative news sentiment are concerning.
*   **Lack of Profitability:** Consistently negative EPS and ROE indicate a fundamental issue with profitability, despite high profit margins.
*   **Mixed Signals:** While some technical indicators like PPO show a slightly positive trend, the overwhelmingly negative "Expected Return" and MRI suggest high risk.
*   **Analyst Neutrality:**  Analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting a lack of strong conviction in either direction.
*   **Competition:** Increasing competition in the telehealth space poses a threat.

**In conclusion, based on the provided data, TDOC appears to be a high-risk investment with significant challenges to overcome.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers behind the negative EPS, ROE, and "Expected Return" figures.  Investors should exercise caution and carefully consider their risk tolerance before investing in TDOC.**
