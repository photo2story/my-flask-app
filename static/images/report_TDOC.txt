*   **CAGR:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is strongly negative for most recent periods, indicating poor performance.  Early periods (2016-2020) show significant growth.
*   **MDD:** MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates significant risk of loss. Drawdown is how much an investment is down from the peak before it recovers again.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently negative in recent years, implying underperformance relative to the market.
*   **Beta:**  Beta fluctuates. A beta of 1.7 to 1.9 indicates higher volatility than the market, while a beta of 0.5 indicates lower volatility than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap (in Billions) decreases steadily reflecting share dilution (issuance of new stocks)

*   **60-day SMA:** 7.7648

**Analysis:**

The stock price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is slightly below the closing price indicating a very slight potential for a change in direction, but more data is needed. The recent change indicates a small rebound.

**3) RSI, PPO and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 27.56
*   **PPO:** -0.3152
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (133 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 0.7 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -9726.1

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, but this should be considered in light of other indicators.
*   **RSI:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 27.56, indicating that the stock is potentially oversold (typically, below 30 is considered oversold).
*   **PPO:** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is negative, suggesting a bearish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Recommends going all-in; however, note that the data source for this Hybrid Signal also considers TDOC very safe with an MRI of 0.90.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** Short-term increases exist despite the negative expected return.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major cause for concern, suggesting significant risks associated with long-term investment.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Several articles suggest alternatives to Teladoc ("Forget Teladoc").
*   **Valuation Assessment:** Some articles discuss valuation after recent rebounds, implying potential recovery or temporary price increases.
*   **HIMS Comparison:** Articles compare Teladoc to competitors like HIMS, indicating market competition and the need to evaluate relative performance.

**Analysis:**

The news headlines present a mixed picture. While some articles suggest potential opportunities (valuation assessments, short-term rebound), the overall sentiment is cautious or negative, especially concerning long-term investment and competitive pressures.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:**  (No rating provided)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 9.18 / 12.00 / 7.00

**Analysis:**

The average analyst target price is $9.18.  Given the current price of $7.05, this suggests a potential upside. However, the absence of a consensus rating (Buy/Hold/Sell) makes it difficult to gauge overall analyst sentiment.  The wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출     |
|------------|-------|----------|
| 2025-10-30 | -0.28 | 0.63 B$  |
| 2025-07-30 | -0.19 | 0.63 B$  |
| 2025-05-01 | -0.53 | 0.63 B$  |
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19 | 0.64 B$  |
| 2025-10-30 | -0.19 | 0.64 B$  |

**Analysis:**

*   **EPS:** Earnings per share (EPS) is consistently negative, indicating unprofitability.
*   **Revenue:** Revenue is relatively stable around $0.63-$0.64 billion.

This suggests that while the company is generating consistent revenue, it is struggling to become profitable.

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30 | $0.63B  | 70.12%        |
| 2025-06-30 | $0.63B  | 69.85%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.63B  | 68.73%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B  | 70.50%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity  | ROE    |
|------------|---------|--------|
| 2025-09-30 | $1.39B  | -3.56% |
| 2025-06-30 | $1.42B  | -2.30% |
| 2025-03-31 | $1.43B  | -6.52% |
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B  | -3.25% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B  | -2.21% |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue is stable, as previously noted.
*   **Profit Margin:** While the profit margin *appears* high, this is likely a **Gross Profit Margin**, *not* a Net Profit Margin. A high Gross Profit Margin with negative EPS indicates that operating expenses (SG&A, R&D) and/or interest expenses are significantly eating into profits.
*   **Equity:** Equity is decreasing, likely due to continued losses.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, confirming unprofitability and poor return on shareholder investment.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Overall, the data paints a concerning picture for Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC).

*   **Underperformance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Negative Growth:** CAGR is negative.
*   **High Volatility:** Depending on the time period, volatility as measured by Beta has a tendency to be higher than market volatility.
*   **Unprofitability:** EPS and ROE are consistently negative. While the Gross Profit Margin is high, operating and interest expenses are significant.
*   **Negative Sentiment:** News articles lean toward caution or suggest alternatives.
*   **Uncertain Outlook:** While analysts have a target price higher than the current price, the lack of a consensus rating and the wide target range suggest uncertainty. The extremely negative "expected return" is a critical warning sign.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, **investing in TDOC is highly risky**. While a short-term rebound might be possible (RSI oversold, positive short-term divergence change), the company's fundamental challenges (unprofitability, underperformance, negative sentiment) outweigh any potential upside. A very careful and well-researched approach is absolutely essential before considering any investment in TDOC.
