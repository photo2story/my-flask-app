**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly volatile alpha and beta values over the years, indicative of a high-risk, high-growth (or in recent years, high-loss) investment.

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 83.4%  | 49.6%  | 1.3   | 6.0   |        |
| 2016-2018  | 175.5% | 49.3%  | 1.7   | 8.5   |        |
| 2017-2019  | 407.4% | 49.3%  | 1.8   | 14.4  |        |
| 2018-2020  | 452.4% | 49.3%  | 0.7   | 34.4  |        |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.21 (Last Market: $9.19)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $9.45
* **20-day Moving Average:** $9.14
* **60-day Moving Average:** $8.63

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend. However, it is above its 60-day moving average, indicating some support.  The difference between the last market price and closing price is minimal.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.42 (Neutral)
* **PPO:** -0.21 (Bearish)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.16 (+) (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This needs further explanation and clarification â€“  a 0% expected return indicates no expectation of outperformance relative to the benchmark over a two-year horizon.  This should be expanded upon with detailed justification.)

The RSI suggests a neutral market sentiment, while the PPO points to bearish momentum. The positive delta relative divergence indicates a recent short-term upward trend.  The near-zero Expected Return needs significant expansion, including clarifying the methodology.  A 0% expectation would only make sense if the company is expected to perform exactly in line with the market, which is not the case historically.



**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The recent financial performance shows consistent losses in EPS, although revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64 - $0.66 Billion.  The provided data does not include expected earnings, and comparing to previous periods shows a worsening financial picture.  More detailed analysis including comparison to previous quarters and industry benchmarks is needed.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19  | $0.64 B     |
| 2024-08-01 | -4.92  | $0.64 B     |
| 2024-04-26 | -0.49  | $0.65 B     |
| 2023-10-27 | -0.35  | $0.66 B     |
| 2024-10-31 | -0.35  | $0.66 B     |


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

The financial data reveals concerning trends:

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins are declining, suggesting increasing costs or declining efficiency.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity fluctuates, and Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating returns on invested capital. This is a serious concern.

Further analysis is required to understand the reasons behind these trends.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires current news analysis from sources like Shacknews and Finbold within the last two days.  Please provide the relevant news articles for a comprehensive analysis.)*  The absence of recent news makes it impossible to offer an accurate assessment of recent market outlook, analyst opinions, or performance highlights.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC has shown significantly poor performance compared to the S&P 500, displaying substantial negative returns and high volatility.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with recent short-term upward momentum, but underlying negative trends.  Financials reveal declining profitability and negative ROE, raising major concerns about the company's long-term viability.  The lack of recent news prevents a thorough assessment of current market sentiment and analyst opinions.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the company's underperformance and a comprehensive analysis of its future prospects is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The 0% expected return is highly questionable and needs substantial revision, backed by rigorous financial modelling and market projections.
