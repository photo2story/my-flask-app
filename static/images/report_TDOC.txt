**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR and MDD:** The table shows a significant decline in the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over recent periods, with negative returns in the last few years. This is coupled with high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values are largely negative, suggesting that TDOC has underperformed its benchmark after accounting for risk.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are relatively low, close to 0, indicating that TDOC's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500). This could be due to company-specific issues rather than broad market trends affecting the stock.
*   **Cap:** The market capitalization has decreased substantially from 35.1B to 1.2B.

    *   60-day Moving Average: 7.6477
*   **Analysis:** The stock price has shown a slight increase in the latest session. However, the current price is below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term downtrend.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Numbers:**
    *   MRI: 0.366 (Low Risk)
    *   RSI: 47.86
    *   PPO: 0.0311
    *   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 50% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.38)
    *   20-day Relative Spread Change: -0.3 (Short-term decline)
    *   Expected Return: -5157.5%
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests low risk, which might be misleading given the other negative indicators.
    *   The RSI of 47.86 indicates a neutral condition, neither overbought nor oversold.
    *   The PPO is positive but close to zero, indicating a weak uptrend.
    *   The hybrid signal recommends a partial buy with caution, aligning with the low MRI but contradicting the negative trend.
    *   The negative change in relative spread (-0.3) reinforces the short-term downtrend.
    *   The **extremely negative expected return (-5157.5%) is highly concerning**. It suggests a very pessimistic outlook for future performance relative to the S&P 500. The slight price change is not significant enough to alter this overall negative assessment.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Summary:** Recent news indicates business developments, analyst discussions about performance, stock volatility, and warnings from market experts to monitor news and announcements.
*   **Analysis:** The news summary paints a picture of a company undergoing significant changes and facing scrutiny. The volatility mentioned suggests uncertainty, and the advice to monitor news indicates that the stock's future is sensitive to new information.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜         | EPS   | 매출     |
