**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR & MDD:**  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has been extremely negative in recent periods (2019-2025).  Maximum Drawdown (MDD) remains high, indicating significant risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is overwhelmingly negative, meaning TDOC has consistently underperformed its benchmark (risk-adjusted).
*   **Beta:** Beta is volatile, shifting from positive to negative territory. A negative beta suggests an inverse relationship with the market, but with the significant underperformance, this may not be a beneficial trait.
*   **Cap(B):** Cap(B) has been declining which is a serious consideration.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 7.845
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 8.48, Previous Close: 7.8, Change: 8.72% (Significant positive movement)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 8.154
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 7.9042
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 7.7717

**Analysis:**

*   The recent price surge (+8.72%) is significant and is above all the short/mid-term moving averages. This could signal a potential short-term reversal or just a temporary bounce. The sudden increase should be investigated for supporting news.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.74 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.0038 (Slightly bearish, but close to zero)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (130 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-09-02) - suggests aggressive buying
*   **20-Day Relative Deviation Change:** 0.0 (Indicates flat movement and no change in deviation compared to VOO)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -9513.1 (Extremely negative, indicating very poor projected long-term performance relative to the S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI Contradiction:** The high MRI (0.9) suggests a high recommendation for investment, BUT this contradicts all other data points.  This could mean the MRI model is not suitable for this stock, or is lagging significantly behind recent performance.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is contradicting the expected return. This needs further investigation.
*   **Extreme Caution:** The *exceptionally* negative expected return should be a MAJOR red flag. It indicates the model projects severe underperformance.

*   **Positive Headlines:**
    *   "Etsy, Snap, The RealReal, Instacart, and Teladoc Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know" - Potentially driven by sector rotation or specific news.

*   **Negative ROE:** Return on Equity is negative, reflecting poor profitability relative to shareholder equity.

**7. Comprehensive Summary & Conclusion**

*   **Key Challenges:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   Negative and declining CAGR.
    *   High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicating high risk.
    *   Negative Alpha, showing consistent underperformance.
    *   Negative ROE and declining Equity.
    *   Inconsistent (negative) EPS despite stable revenue.
    *   Extremely negative expected return.
*   **Potential Strengths:**
    *   High profit margins suggest operational efficiency *if* costs can be managed to achieve profitability.
    *   Analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting some believe in potential recovery.
    *   Recent price surge.
*   **Contradictions/Concerns:**
    *   The MRI signals contradicts with the expected return and historical under performance and should be investigated.
    *   The hybrid signal is contradicting the expected return. This needs further investigation.
*   **Overall Recommendation:**

    Given the overwhelming negative indicators (underperformance, negative growth, poor profitability metrics, and a severely negative expected return), **extreme caution is warranted.**

    While there are some potentially positive aspects (high profit margins, recent price surge), these are not enough to outweigh the significant risks and historical underperformance. The contradicting data from the MRI and Hybrid Signal need further investigation.

    **A "Hold" rating might be justifiable for existing shareholders hoping for a turnaround, but a new investment would be highly speculative at this time.** Monitor earnings, equity trends, and any fundamental changes in the business model closely.
