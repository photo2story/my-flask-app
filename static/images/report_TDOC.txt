**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows a dramatic decline in recent years. The early periods (2015-2020) showed very strong growth, but subsequent periods experienced significant negative growth.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility in the stock's price.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is primarily negative in recent periods, implying that TDOC has significantly underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) after accounting for risk.
*   **Beta:**  Beta is generally low or negative, especially in recent years, suggesting that TDOC's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market and may even move in the opposite direction.
*   **Cap:**  The market capitalization has decreased significantly, reflecting the declining investor confidence and stock performance.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movements**

*   **Current Price:** 8.93
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 9.02, Previous Close: 8.94, Change: 0.89% (slight increase)
*   **Moving Averages:** 5-day (8.47), 20-day (8.27), 60-day (7.79)

    **Analysis:** The stock is trading above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend.  The small increase in the last market price could indicate positive momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 54.61 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.15 (Slightly positive, indicating a minor upward trend in price momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Short-term decline relative to VOO)
*   **Expected Return:** -9592.1% (Extremely negative projected return)

    **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is neutral. The PPO is slightly positive. The Hybrid Signal recommends a "Buy", but the extraordinarily negative expected return is a major red flag. The recent decrease in relative divergence indicates further underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the short term. The positive change in the last market data {'price': 9.02, 'previousClose': 8.94, 'change': 0.89} could indicate positive momentum.

*   **Positive Headlines:** Hims & Hers partnership, inclusion in medical stock lists, AI-powered safety tool.
