*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.90
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $7.78

**Analysis:** TDOC's price is above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The recent 2.64% jump is a notable positive signal, potentially indicating renewed investor interest or a reaction to recent news.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 55.78 (Neutral)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.35 (Slightly Bullish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (129 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **20-Day Relative Disparity Change:** +0.6 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -2015.6% (Significant underperformance vs. S&P 500 in the long term)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, which seems contradictory considering the other factors. The RSI is neutral. The PPO, while positive, is not strongly bullish. The change in relative disparity indicates recent short-term improvement. The expected return is a major red flag, suggesting significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. The hybrid signal suggests a full investment strategy. However, this should be weighed against the negative expected return. The price jump suggests the market is reacting to some short-term positive news.

**Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. The Medicare policy deadline introduces uncertainty. The stock surge is positive, but its sustainability is questionable. The broader industry analysis provides context. The mention in "Stocks Making Big Moves" confirms recent volatility. The headline about Teladoc rising as the market dips is a positive sign of relative strength.

### 5. Recent Earnings Analysis

| 날짜         | EPS   | 매출       |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-07-30   | -0.19 | 0.63 B$    |
| 2025-05-01   | -0.53 | 0.63 B$    |
| 2024-10-31   | -0.19 | 0.64 B$    |
| 2024-08-01   | -4.92 | 0.64 B$    |
| 2025-07-30   | -4.92 | 0.64 B$    |

**Analysis:** EPS (Earnings Per Share) is consistently negative, indicating unprofitability. Revenue has been relatively stable around $0.63-0.64 billion. The significant negative EPS in the 2024-08-01 and 2025-07-30 quarters is concerning and warrants further investigation.

### 6. Financial Information

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30 | $0.63B  | 69.85%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.63B  | 68.73%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B  | 70.50%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B  | 70.73%        |

| Quarter    | Equity  | ROE      |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 2025-06-30 | $1.42B  | -2.30%   |
| 2025-03-31 | $1.43B  | -6.52%   |
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B  | -3.25%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B  | -2.21%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B  | -55.77%  |

**Analysis:** Revenue is relatively stable. Profit margins are strong, consistently around 70%, indicating good control over costs of services. Equity is declining slightly. ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, reinforcing the unprofitability concern. The large negative ROE in Q2 2024 aligns with the significant EPS loss reported in the earnings data.

### 7. Overall Summary

TDOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While there are some short-term positive signals (recent price jump, slightly bullish PPO), the long-term outlook is concerning due to consistent unprofitability (negative EPS, negative ROE), a very negative expected return relative to the S&P 500, and declining equity. The high-profit margins are a positive aspect, but they are not translating into overall profitability. The analyst consensus is "Hold," and the target price suggests potential upside, but this should be viewed cautiously. The news flow is mixed.

**Recommendation:**  Given the unprofitability, negative long-term expected return, and underperformance relative to the S&P 500, a cautious approach is warranted. While the recent price surge and MRI might tempt some investors, the underlying financials suggest significant risks. Further research into the causes of the significant EPS losses and the company's plans to achieve profitability is essential before considering a long-term investment. The hybrid signal suggestion of full investment should be disregarded in light of the negative expected return.
