**2. Recent Price Movement:**

*   **Current Price:** $8.29
*   **Previous Close:** $8.35
*   **Change:** -0.72%
*   **5-day Moving Average:** $8.462
*   **20-day Moving Average:** $7.614
*   **60-day Moving Average:** $7.283

**Analysis:** The price is slightly down from the previous close. The current price is below the 5-day moving average, indicating a short-term downward trend.  However, it is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential medium-term upward trend (though the 5-day crossing below the 20-day would signal a weakening trend).

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3301 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 64.7368 (Approaching Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 1.4581 (Positive, indicating an upward trend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (4 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.1 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -9486.6%

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates low market risk, but this might be misleading if specific to TDOC and not the broader market. The RSI is approaching overbought territory, suggesting the price may be due for a correction. The PPO is positive, confirming the upward trend indicated by the moving averages. The Hybrid signal suggests buying a small amount, but with caution. The negative change in relative divergence indicates short-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  The extremely negative expected return suggests a very pessimistic outlook based on the model.  The price change of -0.72% since last close is a notable downward pressure but not significant enough to warrant a flag as a "sharp drop."

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출      |
| ---------- | ----- | --------- |
| 2025-05-01 | -0.53 | 0.63 B$   |
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19 | 0.64 B$   |
| 2024-08-01 | -4.92 | 0.64 B$   |
| 2024-04-26 | -0.49 | 0.65 B$   |
| 2025-05-01 | -0.49 | 0.65 B$   |

**Analysis:** TDOC has consistently reported negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) over the last several quarters, indicating a lack of profitability. While revenue has remained relatively stable around $0.63-0.65 billion, the large negative EPS in 2024-08-01 is concerning and requires further investigation. Duplicated entry 2025-05-01 with -0.49 is suspicious.

**6. Financial Information:**
