| 2023-2025  | -35.0% | 81.6% | -101.0% | -0.8   | 1.3    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Early Growth:** TDOC showed strong growth (CAGR) and high Alpha in the earlier periods (2015-2020), indicating outperformance relative to the market.
*   **Recent Struggles:**  The more recent periods (2019-2025) are concerning, with negative CAGR, significantly negative Alpha, and increasing negative Beta. This suggests substantial underperformance and an inverse correlation with the market.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values show an interesting trend. Early periods showed a negative beta or a low positive one, suggesting low correlation to market returns. However, this beta became increasingly negative, suggesting an increasingly inverse relationship with the S&P 500.
*   **Capitalization:** The "Cap(B)" column shows the company's market capitalization in billions.  Notice the large increase from 2018-2020 followed by a decline. This mirrors the stock's rise and subsequent fall.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 7.23
*   **Last Market Close:** Price: 7.21, Previous Close: 7.26, Change: -0.69%
*   **5-day SMA:** 7.274
*   **20-day SMA:** 7.4435
*   **60-day SMA:** 7.9054

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a downtrend. The negative change in the last market close reinforces this.

**3) RSI, PPO Index Indicators, and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 39.19 (approaching oversold but not yet)
*   **PPO:** -0.1761 (slightly negative, indicating bearish momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (132 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.3 (negative trend)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10382.5  (extremely negative, suggesting significant expected underperformance)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.8 suggests a Medium Investment recommendation according to the provided scale.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is below 50, indicating bearish momentum, but is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* signal a potential for a rebound, but not necessarily.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO reinforces the bearish sentiment.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal is a very aggressive one, as it suggests allocating all available cash into the stock (0% cash holdings), allocating 0.8% of total holdings in monthly investments. While seemingly safe, MRI may not reflect overall market conditions.
*   **Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms the short-term decline relative to the comparison stock (VOO).
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Why Teladoc (TDOC) Stock Is Up Today:** This suggests a short-term positive movement, but it's important to understand the reason for the "up" day (e.g., a sector-wide rally or company-specific news).
*   **(TDOC) Market Performance Analysis (TDOC:CA):**  Needs to be investigated to see the analysis's conclusion.
*   **Barclays Initiates Coverage on Teladoc (TDOC) with Equal Weight at $8.50:** "Equal Weight" is a neutral rating, suggesting Barclays doesn't see significant upside or downside in the near term. The $8.50 target is slightly above the current price.
*   **Is Teladoc a Bargain After a 96% Slide and DCF Suggesting Major Upside?:** This is a key question. The article needs to be examined to understand the assumptions behind the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis. DCF valuations are very sensitive to input parameters.
*   **Teladoc Health CLO Vandervoort sells $42,831 in TDOC stock:** Insider selling is generally viewed negatively, although this is not a large amount for a CLO and could be for personal reasons.
*   **Barclays Initiates Coverage on Teladoc (TDOC) with Equal Weight at $8.50:** Same as above.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Neutral (based on the lack of a specified key).
*   **Opinions:** 22 analysts covering the stock.
*   **Target Price:** Average: $9.18, High: $12.00, Low: $7.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:**  No information provided about recent changes.

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is neutral. The average target price of $9.18 is moderately higher than the current price, suggesting some potential upside, but the range is wide, indicating uncertainty. The lack of information on recent rating changes makes it difficult to assess current analyst sentiment.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS    | 매출      |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 2025-10-30 | -0.28  | 0.63 B$   |
| 2025-07-30 | -0.19  | 0.63 B$   |
| 2025-05-01 | -0.53  | 0.63 B$   |
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19  | 0.64 B$   |
| 2025-10-30 | -0.19  | 0.64 B$   |

**Analysis:** Teladoc has been consistently losing money (negative EPS) over the past several quarters. Revenue has remained relatively stable around $0.63-0.64 billion. This lack of profitability is a major concern. *Note: There is a duplicated row in the table.*

**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.63B   | 70.12%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.63B   | 69.85%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $0.63B   | 68.73%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $0.64B   | 70.50%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $0.64B   | 71.94%        |

**Analysis:** While revenue has been stable, profitability is more revealing. The table shows a *high* profit margin, well over 60%. These are *gross* profit margins. It's important to remember that this doesn't tell the whole story; the earnings figures (EPS) are negative, indicating that operating expenses, interest, and taxes are eating away these profits to create an overall *net* loss.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE     |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| 2025-09-30   | $1.39B   | -3.56%  |
| 2025-06-30   | $1.42B   | -2.30%  |
| 2025-03-31   | $1.43B   | -6.52%  |
| 2024-12-31   | $1.49B   | -3.25%  |
| 2024-09-30   | $1.51B   | -2.21%  |

**Analysis:** Equity is slowly decreasing, and the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative.  This means the company is not generating profits from its equity. The negative ROE confirms that Teladoc is losing money relative to its shareholders' equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Teladoc Health (TDOC) presents a high-risk investment opportunity based on the provided data.

*   **Poor Performance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Deteriorating Financials:**  Consistently negative EPS and ROE indicate ongoing losses.  While gross profit margins are high, operating expenses and other factors are leading to overall losses.
*   **Bearish Momentum:** Technical indicators like the RSI and PPO suggest continued bearish momentum.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** While analyst coverage exists, the consensus is neutral, and the target price only suggests limited upside.
*   **News & Events:** Recent news is mixed, with some positive headlines offset by insider selling and neutral analyst ratings. The potential upside highlighted by the DCF analysis requires further scrutiny to understand the underlying assumptions.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Aggressively pushes "cash-0" buy for stocks, allocating as much possible into a position, but is a risky recommendation with the details available.
*   **Expected Return:** Extremely negative expected return suggesting long-term underperformance.

**Conclusion:**

While Teladoc operates in a growth industry (telehealth), the company's current financial performance and market sentiment raise significant concerns. The stock is trading below its moving averages, indicating a downtrend, and profitability remains elusive. The extremely negative expected return raises a red flag. Before considering an investment, investors should carefully examine the company's plans for achieving profitability and assess the assumptions underlying any positive valuation analyses. Be aware that the hybrid signal may be a risk.
