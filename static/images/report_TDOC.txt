The difference is a staggering -185.8%, placing it near the lower bound of its historical range against the S&P 500 (as indicated by the relative divergence of 0.2).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $10.07
* **5-day Moving Average:** $10.39
* **20-day Moving Average:** $10.71
* **60-day Moving Average:** $9.63

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (33.91):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-1.47):** Shows a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (-0.3):**  Confirms a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided data indicates zero expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  Given the current negative trends, this might be a conservative estimate.  If the current price of $10.07 is considered significant (potentially due to a sharp recent drop), further investigation into the cause of the drop is needed to evaluate potential for a rebound.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a consistent pattern of net losses (negative EPS) across all reported quarters. While revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64 - $0.66 billion, there's no clear upward trend.  The significant drop in EPS from Q2 2024 (-4.92) to Q3 2024 (-0.19) requires further analysis to understand underlying factors. There is no information on whether these results beat or missed expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue is relatively flat, showing minimal growth.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are consistently high (70-72%), despite negative EPS.  This discrepancy requires further investigation (e.g., non-GAAP adjustments).
* **Equity:** Equity has fluctuated significantly.
* **ROE:** ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on shareholder equity.

The high profit margins despite negative EPS and fluctuating equity suggest accounting practices that warrant further scrutiny by referring to the complete financial statements.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news is provided. Information on market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights is also absent.  This severely limits a comprehensive analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, showing a long-term downward trend.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but negative earnings and ROE paint a concerning picture. The consistent net losses and flat revenue growth raise significant concerns about the company's long-term sustainability.  The lack of recent news and detailed analyst opinions makes a complete assessment difficult.  Further investigation into the accounting practices and the reasons behind the significant EPS drop in Q2 2024 is crucial before forming any investment decisions. The high profit margins despite negative EPS needs further examination through complete financial statements.  Without additional information, a cautious approach to investing in TDOC is warranted.
