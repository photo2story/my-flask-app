**6) Overall Conclusion:**

TDOC is currently experiencing significant challenges.  Negative EPS, negative ROE, and substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 paint a bleak picture.

The extremely negative expected return figure needs to be verified.  Before any investment consideration, a deep dive into the company's financials, strategic direction, and competitive landscape is crucial.  A long-term investment strategy requires careful consideration of the risks involved, given the current negative trends.  The provided data suggests a high-risk, high-volatility investment.
