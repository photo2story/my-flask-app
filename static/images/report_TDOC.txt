## Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) Investment Review

This report analyzes Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC), a telehealth company providing virtual care services, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Teladoc's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is -183.7%, indicating a substantial underperformance.  While the relative divergence of -0.5 suggests it's near the lower end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500, this is still a considerable underperformance.  The provided CAGR data shows periods of extremely high growth followed by sharp declines, highlighting significant volatility.  The consistently low alpha suggests that TDOC's returns haven't significantly outperformed the market after accounting for its beta (volatility).  The beta values fluctuate substantially, suggesting changes in the stock's sensitivity to market movements over time.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $10.69
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $10.89 (slightly above the closing price, suggesting some recent downward pressure)
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $10.40 (below the closing price, potentially indicating a short-term bullish trend)
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.47 (significantly below the closing price, suggesting a longer-term upward trend)

The price is above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential short-term upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (62.97):** Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to the overbought territory.
* **PPO (-0.3752):** A negative value indicates bearish momentum, with the price of TDOC moving slower than its moving average.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-0.3):** Shows a recent short-term decline in the stock's relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided expected return of 0% indicates no projected outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is consistent with the historical data and current market sentiment.  There is no mention of a significant price jump, but the price being higher than its 60-day moving average implies some upward pressure.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a consistent trend of negative EPS over the last several quarters, with no significant revenue growth and a mixed profit margin profile.  There's no information provided to compare these results against expectations, so it's impossible to assess whether the company is meeting or missing analysts' forecasts.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue has remained relatively flat, fluctuating between $0.64B and $0.66B. Profit margins are relatively high (70-72%), but this is not necessarily sustainable given consistently negative EPS.  Equity has fluctuated significantly, and the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital. This negative ROE raises serious concerns about the company’s profitability and long-term sustainability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions within the past two days were provided.  Without access to current market sentiment, recent news reports, and analyst ratings, a comprehensive analysis is limited.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC has shown significant volatility and substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While the recent price action shows some short-term bullish signals (above the 20 and 60-day moving averages), the consistent negative EPS, fluctuating equity, and negative ROE raise serious concerns about the company's long-term financial health and potential for future growth. The relatively high profit margin is misleading given the negative EPS.  The lack of positive news and a projected 0% expected return against the S&P 500 further dampen prospects.  Before considering any investment, thorough due diligence is critical, considering the company’s financial statements, competitive landscape and future growth prospects.  Additional information, such as analyst ratings and future guidance, is needed for a more complete and informed investment decision.
