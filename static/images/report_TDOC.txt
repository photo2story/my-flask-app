This report analyzes Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC), a telehealth company providing virtual care services.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

TDOC's cumulative return is -66.41%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which has a cumulative return of 120.31%.  The difference is a substantial -186.7%, placing it at the 20th percentile of historical divergence relative to the S&P 500 (based on a range of -188.5% to 710.6%). The high beta (around 2.0 consistently across the provided periods) indicates that TDOC's price movements are significantly more volatile than the overall market.  While past CAGR values were impressive (reaching 435% in 2018-2020), the recent performance shows a sharp decline, with consistently negative returns in the last few years.  The consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) reflects significant price drops during these periods. Alpha is consistently reported as 0.0, suggesting the stock's performance is primarily driven by market movements (consistent with the high beta).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $9.29
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $9.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.77

The price is slightly below the 20-day and significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price change of 4.51% shows a recent small upward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.91 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.19 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.0 (Indicates a recent short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -6864.3% (This extremely negative value is likely an error and needs clarification.  It's crucial to understand the methodology used to arrive at this figure.)

The 4.51% price increase might indicate a temporary bounce, but given the negative PPO and relative divergence, a sustained upward trend isn't strongly supported by these indicators.  The extremely low expected return requires further investigation and clarification.  The extremely negative expected return should be carefully examined, possibly due to an error in calculation or model assumptions. The prediction of long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is highly improbable given the current circumstances.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows consistent net losses (negative EPS) over the past few quarters. While revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64B - $0.66B, the inability to translate this revenue into profit is a major concern. The significant drop in EPS from Q2 2024 (-$4.92) to Q3 2024 (-$0.19) should be investigated for any significant events or accounting changes.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue    |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19 | $0.64B     |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92 | $0.64B     |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49 | $0.65B     |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35 | $0.66B     |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35 | $0.66B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals concerning trends. While revenue remains relatively stable, profitability is a serious issue.  Profit margins are high, but this is likely due to accounting methods. The significantly negative Return on Equity (ROE) consistently across the reported quarters demonstrates a major issue in effectively utilizing shareholder equity to generate profit.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B  | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B  | 69.89%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B  | 70.72%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.66B  | 71.83%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE       |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B   | -2.21%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B   | -55.77%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B   | -3.58%    |

| 2023-09-30 | $2.29B   | -2.49%    |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance is significantly lagging the market, showing a substantial negative cumulative return. While revenue is relatively stable, the company is consistently unprofitable, exhibiting negative EPS and ROE. Technical indicators suggest a weak short-term trend.  The incredibly negative projected return needs further explanation.  Given the current financial performance and market underperformance, a long-term investment in TDOC requires a high risk tolerance and a thorough understanding of the company's turnaround strategy.  Further investigation into the -6864.3% expected return is crucial before forming any investment decisions.
