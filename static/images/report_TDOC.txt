**7. Overall Analysis & Conclusion**

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) faces significant challenges. The stock has drastically underperformed the S&P 500, with the divergence at an extreme low. Recent performance has been poor, as reflected in the negative Alpha, Beta, and expected returns. Although recent news shows positive signs from analysts' view, the MRI result is contrary to other indicators, suggesting that other metrics have to be closely inspected. Moreover, there are a lot of negative results about recent price drops. Analyst consensus is "Hold," with a target price offering potential upside, but considerable uncertainty. While revenue is stable and profit margins are high, consistent negative EPS and declining equity raise concerns about long-term financial health.

**Recommendation:** Cautious approach is advised. Monitor news and earnings closely for signs of improvement. The stock appears risky, and further due diligence is necessary before considering an investment.
