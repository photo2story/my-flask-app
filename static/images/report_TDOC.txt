* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +2.4 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -1229.0% (This extremely negative value suggests a very pessimistic outlook and should be carefully reviewed for accuracy).  This dramatic negative figure is likely due to a combination of factors and needs further investigation.

The negative price change (-$0.14) is relatively small and does not indicate a sharp drop.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company has reported negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) for each quarter.  Revenue is relatively stable around $0.64B-$0.66B, however, this stability does not mask the serious losses.


| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19 | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92 | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49 | $0.65 B      |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35 | $0.66 B      |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35 | $0.66 B      |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively consistent. However, the profit margin, while relatively high, doesn't compensate for the negative ROE (Return on Equity), indicating significant financial challenges. The sharp decrease in equity in Q2 2024 is a serious cause for concern and should be investigated.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B | 70.50%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72%       |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE      |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B | -3.25%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24%   |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is currently experiencing significant financial challenges.  While revenue remains relatively stable, consistently negative EPS and a highly volatile negative ROE point to serious underlying issues.  The stock's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The exceptionally negative expected return (-1229%) highlights the significant risks associated with this investment.  Further investigation into the causes of the negative ROE and large negative expected return is critical before any investment decision.  A long-term investment strategy should be approached with extreme caution and only after a thorough review of the company's business model, future prospects and the accuracy of the provided expected return.  The provided data alone strongly suggests a high risk scenario.
