**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $8.41
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $8.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $9.25
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $10.20

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The recent price change shows a slight increase ({'price': 8.41, 'previousClose': 8.17, 'change': 2.94}) which is not a significant bounce considering the overall negative trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 34.64 (Suggests oversold conditions, but not necessarily a buy signal in the context of the overall downtrend.)
* **PPO:** -0.94 (Negative PPO confirms bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.2 (Indicates a short-term weakening of the stock's relative strength).
* **Expected Return:** -4880.3% (This extremely negative expected return highlights the significant risk involved).  This dramatically negative expected return suggests a very pessimistic outlook and should be interpreted cautiously.  The large negative value likely reflects the severe underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and should not be considered a precise prediction.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue        |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19  | $0.64B         |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92  | $0.64B         |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49  | $0.65B         |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35  | $0.66B         |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35  | $0.66B         |

Consistent negative EPS figures indicate ongoing losses.  Revenue remains relatively stable, but without profitability, this is not sustainable in the long run.  The large negative EPS in August 2024 warrants further investigation into potential contributing factors.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B | 70.50%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72%       |

High profit margins are notable, but misleading without context of significant negative EPS values.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE      |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B | -3.25%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24%   |

Negative ROE across all quarters clearly demonstrates that the company is not generating returns on its equity.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance is deeply concerning. While it maintains relatively high profit margins, consistent negative EPS and ROE figures paint a picture of a company struggling to translate revenue into profits. The stock's significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, coupled with negative technical indicators and an extremely pessimistic projected return, suggests a high-risk investment.  The large negative EPS in August 2024 requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes.  A long-term investment strategy would need to carefully consider the substantial risks involved and the lack of positive returns.  Further due diligence is highly recommended before any investment decision.
