This report analyzes Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC), a telehealth company providing virtual care services.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Teladoc's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500.  The difference is -180.8%, indicating a substantial underperformance.  While the provided relative divergence metric suggests its underperformance is near the historical minimum, this doesn't negate the significant loss compared to the market benchmark. The massive divergence highlights the company's struggles relative to the broader market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.78
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $9.75
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $9.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.77

The stock price is trading very close to its recent moving averages, suggesting a period of relative price stability.  There is no indication of a significant recent price jump or drop based on this data.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 46.29 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.34 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -6506.4% (This is an extraordinarily high negative value and needs further clarification.  It's likely erroneous or requires context about the calculation methodology).  This figure is not reliable and is likely a calculation error.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data reveals a concerning trend:

* **Revenue:** Revenue remains relatively flat around $0.64B - $0.66B over the past few quarters, showing minimal growth.
* **EPS:** EPS consistently shows significant losses, worsening significantly from Q2 2024 (-$4.92) before showing some improvements in subsequent quarters though still with significant losses.  There's no clear upward trend.

The data only shows actual results and therefore doesn't include any information about whether the reported numbers beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins, while high, are exhibiting a slight downward trend.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity fluctuates, and the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative and highly volatile, indicating significant issues with profitability and potentially capital management. The negative ROE highlights the company's struggles to generate profits relative to its equity investment.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News:**  The provided data includes recent earnings reports (October 31, 2024, etc.), showing negative EPS and flat revenue.  More information is needed regarding market reaction to the earnings releases.
* **Recent Market Outlook:**  Information on the overall market outlook is missing.
* **Analyst Opinions:**  No analyst opinions or performance highlights are provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC significantly underperformed the S&P 500, showing a large negative cumulative return. While recent price movement is relatively stable, the fundamental picture is troubling.  Consistent negative EPS, flat revenue, and highly volatile negative ROE indicate significant financial challenges. The technical indicators present a mixed picture, with a slightly positive PPO and a positive short-term relative strength change, but an RSI indicating no strong momentum in either direction. The extremely negative expected return is likely an error, but underscores the serious challenges faced by the company.  Further research is necessary to understand the long-term viability of the business model and the possibility for a turnaround.  More information is needed on market sentiment, analyst forecasts, and specific catalysts driving performance before a conclusive opinion can be formed. The provided -6506.4% expected return figure is likely flawed and needs correction.
