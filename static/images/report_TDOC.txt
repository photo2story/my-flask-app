## Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) is a telehealth company providing virtual care services.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, exhibiting high volatility and negative returns recently.  While revenue remains relatively stable, profitability and key financial metrics show significant concern.  The current price shows signs of being oversold, but significant risks remain.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Teladoc Health (TDOC) has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return of TDOC is -69.43%, while VOO shows a 72.17% return. This represents a staggering difference of -141.6 percentage points. The relative divergence indicates TDOC's performance is at the 6.8th percentile relative to its historical volatility against VOO.

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance. While exhibiting exceptionally high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in some periods,  recent years (2019-2025) show drastically negative returns and a declining beta, suggesting decreasing market sensitivity. The consistently high maximum drawdown (MDD) highlights the significant risk associated with TDOC.

* **5-day moving average:** $7.67
* **20-day moving average:** $8.37

* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.5 (Short-term upward momentum, but needs further confirmation)
* **Expected Return:** -1389.0% (This extraordinarily negative figure indicates a very pessimistic outlook, likely reflecting the current market sentiment and historical performance).

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC shows a highly volatile and underperforming stock with significant negative returns compared to the S&P 500. While the RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, the negative earnings, consistently negative ROE, and extremely high risk indicators paint a bleak picture.  The high MDD across all periods further emphasizes the considerable risk involved.  Unless substantial changes in the company's operational efficiency and profitability are demonstrated, investment in TDOC carries significant downside risk and is not recommended at this time.  Further investigation into the causes behind the large negative EPS in August 2024 is crucial.
