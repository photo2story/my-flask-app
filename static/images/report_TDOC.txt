**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) is a telehealth company providing virtual care services.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), TDOC has significantly underperformed.  The cumulative return difference between TDOC and VOO as of the last data point is a staggering -186.4%, indicating TDOC's substantial underperformance relative to the broader market. The provided data shows a range of -188.5% to 710.6%, with TDOC currently at the lower end of that historical range. While the relative divergence suggests TDOC's performance is near its historical low relative to the S&P 500, this doesn't indicate future performance.

The provided CAGR data highlights substantial volatility, swinging from extremely high growth to severe declines.  This underlines the high-risk nature of the investment.

* **Closing Price:** $10.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $9.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $9.576

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend. However, itâ€™s below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend. The recent price change (-$0.49) reflects a minor decrease.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.75  (Neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral sentiment.)
* **PPO:** 0.85 (Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum, although weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -0.3 (Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** -6986.1% (This extremely negative value suggests a significantly negative outlook for long-term returns relative to the S&P 500.  This should be treated with caution and warrants further investigation into its calculation methodology.)

The recent price drop, while relatively small, combined with the negative expected return, paints a cautious picture.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals consistent losses (negative EPS) over the reported periods. While revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64B-$0.66B, the company's inability to generate profits is a significant concern.  The repeated negative EPS figures across multiple quarters highlight a critical issue within the company's financial performance.  Further analysis is needed to understand the reasons behind these consistent losses.


**5. Financial Information:**

The high profit margins (70-72%) are counterintuitive given the consistently negative EPS and ROE. This discrepancy needs further investigation to understand the accounting methods and potential non-cash expenses impacting reported earnings.  The negative ROE across most quarters indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity. The fluctuations in equity also highlight volatility in the company's financial health.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC has severely underperformed the S&P 500, showing a significant negative return compared to the market index.  While some technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook, the consistent negative earnings, negative ROE, and extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 paint a concerning picture. The high profit margins are inconsistent with the losses and need to be investigated. The company's inability to translate revenue into profit remains a critical issue.  Long-term investment should be approached with significant caution given the high risk and the need for substantial improvement in the company's profitability.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended before any investment decision.
