*   **CAGR:** Shows strong growth in earlier periods but has declined sharply in recent years.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD values indicate significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:**  The stock has demonstrated a highly negative alpha in recent years, meaning it's substantially underperforming its benchmark even after accounting for risk.
*   **Beta:** The beta values have fluctuated, becoming negative in recent periods, indicating an inverse correlation with the market.  A beta near -1.8 to -1.9 suggests that the stock tends to move in the opposite direction of the market, and with greater magnitude.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization has decreased dramatically over the past few years.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 7.12
*   **Last-market:**  Price = 6.93, Previous Close = 7.12, Change = -2.67%
*   **5-day SMA:** 7.214
*   **20-day SMA:** 7.4295
*   **60-day SMA:** 7.8605

**Analysis:**  The current price (6.93) is below all the Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a downward trend. The recent price decline (-2.67%) reinforces this trend. The shorter-term SMAs (5-day, 20-day) are lower than the longer-term SMA (60-day), also pointing to recent weakness.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Hybrid Signal Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 30.58
*   **PPO:** -0.21
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (132 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.3 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10382.5

**Analysis:**

*   **RSI (30.58):**  The RSI is near oversold territory (below 30), potentially suggesting a possible, but not guaranteed, rebound.
*   **PPO (-0.21):** PPO is a momentum oscillator, showing the relationship between two moving averages. PPO value under 0 indicates the stock is under bearish sentiment.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid signal is suggesting to put all cash to buy (132 Shares).
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent negative change in relative divergence confirms the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a very strong red flag, indicating a very pessimistic outlook.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **HIMS vs. TDOC Comparison:**  This article likely compares Teladoc to a competitor, which could highlight relative strengths and weaknesses.

*   **Will New Analyst Coverage Shape Teladoc’s Evolving Virtual Care Story for Investors (TDOC)?:**  New analyst coverage could provide updated perspectives on the company's prospects.

**Analysis:** The news headlines paint a mixed picture. The institutional selling and the article highlighting the massive decline are negative signals. Articles discussing potential catalysts or comparisons to competitors warrant further investigation.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:**  Neutral (based on the "-" rating)
*   **Target Price:** Average = 9.18, High = 12.00, Low = 7.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is neutral, but the average target price (9.18) is higher than the current price (6.93), suggesting potential upside according to analysts. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty. The lack of recent rating changes suggests analysts are not actively updating their views.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue is relatively stable.
*   **Profit Margin:** The profit margin is healthy, around 70%, which indicates that the company is efficient in converting sales into profit. However, it's important to note that this is profit margin, not net profit margin (i.e., after all expenses including interest, tax).
*   **Equity:** Equity is decreasing, suggesting that the company's assets are declining relative to its liabilities.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is negative, confirming the lack of profitability for shareholders.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) presents a concerning picture based on the data provided. While revenue remains relatively stable and profit margins are healthy, consistent losses and a dramatic stock price decline point to underlying issues. The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and analyst sentiment is neutral with a wide range of target prices. Key concerns include:

*   **Lack of Profitability:**  The consistent negative EPS and ROE are major red flags.
*   **Negative Alpha & Decreasing Market Capitalization:**  The stock is underperforming even after adjusting for risk, and its market capitalization has significantly decreased.
*   **Downward Trend:**  The stock price is below its moving averages, and the recent change in relative divergence confirms a short-term downward trend.
*   **Mixed Signals:** The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) contradicts the overall bearish sentiment indicated by other metrics and news.
*   **Strong Selling Pressure:** An institutional investor has decreased their position significantly.

**In conclusion:** While some analysts see potential upside, the overall data suggests that Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) is a very risky investment. The high MRI may be misleading, and further due diligence is required before considering an investment in this stock. The negative profitability, significant underperformance, and downward trend warrant caution. The negative expected return is a severe warning.
