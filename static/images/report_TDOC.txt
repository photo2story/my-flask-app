**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
| :--------- | :------ | :------------ |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.63B  | 68.73%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B  | 70.50%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B  | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B  | 69.89%        |

**Analysis:**

*   Revenue has been relatively stable around $0.64 billion per quarter, showing some consistency in the top line.
*   Profit Margin: Profit margins have been consistently high, around 70%, which is generally a positive sign. However, it's important to note that despite these high profit margins, the company is still reporting net losses (as indicated by the negative EPS in the earnings analysis). This suggests that high operating costs or other expenses are offsetting the profitability at the gross level.

**Capital and Profitability**

| Quarter    | Equity | ROE      |
| :--------- | :----- | :------- |
| 2025-03-31 | $1.43B | -6.52%   |
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B | -3.25%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58%   |

**Analysis:**

*   Equity: Equity has generally been decreasing, particularly from March 2024 to March 2025, which could indicate the company is burning through its assets.
*   ROE: Return on Equity (ROE) has been negative for all quarters, confirming that the company is not generating profits from its equity. The particularly large negative ROE in Q2 2024 (-55.77%) is a red flag, indicating significant losses relative to equity.

**7. Overall Analysis**

TDOC is facing significant challenges:

*   **Severe Underperformance:** The stock has drastically underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Profitability:** Consistent negative EPS and ROE show a lack of profitability.
*   **High Volatility:** Recent news highlights significant volatility.
*   **Decreasing Equity:** Declining equity suggests the company is burning through its assets.
*   **Caution Signals:** Hybrid signal and analyst advice suggest caution.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** The -9717.8% expected return signals serious financial concerns.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data, TDOC is a high-risk investment. The company is experiencing significant financial challenges and has consistently underperformed the market. While revenue has been stable, the lack of profitability, decreasing equity, and negative expected return are major causes for concern. The high profit margins aren't translating into net profits due to high operating costs. Investors should exercise extreme caution and conduct further research before considering investing in TDOC. It is difficult to recommend this stock for investment at this time.
