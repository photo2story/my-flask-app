| 2023-2025  | -41.0%  | 72.9%  | -68.0%  | -0.8   | 1.2    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR & MDD:** The table shows a trend of high volatility. Early periods (2015-2020) had strong positive CAGR, but subsequent periods (2019-2025) show significant negative returns and high Maximum Drawdown (MDD). This indicates substantial risk and potential for loss.
*   **Alpha:** The consistently negative alpha from 2019 onwards suggests that TDOC has been consistently underperforming its benchmark (S&P 500), even when adjusted for risk.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values fluctuate, some even being negative, but generally close to zero, indicating TDOC's price movement is weakly correlated with the overall market. A negative beta, such as -0.6, -0.9, and -0.8 for the most recent periods, suggests that the stock tends to move in the opposite direction of the market.
*   **Cap(B):** The declining market capitalization, as shown by the decreasing Cap(B) values, reflects the market's decreasing valuation of the company over time.

*   **20-day Moving Average:** $7.156
*   **60-day Moving Average:** $7.767

**Analysis:**

TDOC's current price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60 days), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The recent price decrease of -1.3% and the fact that the price is below the previous close indicates continued negative momentum.

*   **RSI:** An RSI of 43.51 suggests that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating neutral momentum.
*   **PPO:** The PPO value of 0.0298 is relatively small, suggesting that the short-term and long-term moving averages are close together, and the trend is not strongly defined.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** A positive value of 0.2 suggests a short-term upward trend relative to the comparison benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return of -4325.4% is alarming and suggests that, based on current data, long-term investment in TDOC is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.

| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B  | -3.58%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** The company has maintained relatively stable revenue over the last few quarters. The profit margin is high, consistently around 70%, indicating strong efficiency in generating profit from revenue.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** The equity has decreased significantly from $2.29B in Q1 2024 to $1.43B in Q1 2025, signaling potential financial distress or significant capital deployment. The negative ROE (Return on Equity) values align with the negative EPS, confirming the company's inability to generate profit from its equity. The drastic drop in ROE in Q2 2024 (-55.77%) should be investigated further as it could indicate significant losses or write-downs during that period.

### 7. Overall Summary

Based on the provided data, TDOC presents a concerning picture.

*   **Underperformance:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Negative Financials:** Consistent negative EPS and ROE, declining equity, and volatile historical performance.
*   **Technical Signals:** Current price below moving averages, indicating a downtrend.
*   **Risk:** While the MRI indicates low market risk, the company-specific risks appear high.
*   **News:** Recent news suggests ongoing volatility and significant events that require further investigation.

**Conclusion:**

TDOC's financial performance and market behavior suggest a high-risk investment. The company's struggles to achieve profitability, combined with declining equity and negative returns, are significant red flags. While the short-term relative deviation change might suggest a potential short-term uptick, the long-term outlook based on the data is bearish. Further investigation into the recent news and the causes of the significant financial losses is crucial before making any investment decisions.
