## Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Teladoc Health (TDOC) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the given period.  The cumulative return for TDOC is -66.87%, while VOO shows a 120.63% return. This represents a massive divergence of -187.5%, placing it near the lower bound of the historical range (-188.5%). The relative divergence of 0.1 indicates it's extremely close to the historical low point compared to the S&P 500.

**Company Overview:** Teladoc Health Inc. provides virtual healthcare services, including telehealth consultations and related services.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.53
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $9.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $10.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.69

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The proximity to the 60-day moving average suggests potential support, but further downward pressure is indicated by the 20-day MA position.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 35.68 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, but not necessarily a strong buy signal.)
* **PPO:** -1.93 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -0.6 (Short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** -6244.1% (This extremely negative figure suggests a very low probability of exceeding S&P 500 returns over the long term.  The methodology used to calculate this value is unclear and needs further justification.)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a consistent pattern of negative EPS throughout the past year. Revenue has remained relatively flat around $0.64 - $0.66 Billion.  There's no information provided on earnings expectations, so it's impossible to determine if the company "beat" or "missed" expectations.  The significant negative EPS is concerning.

**Key Observations:**

* **Revenue:** Relatively stagnant.
* **EPS:** Consistently negative and worsening (e.g., -0.19 vs. -4.92 in Q3 & Q4 2024), indicating substantial losses.
* **Profitability:** Negative EPS is dragging down profitability; further details on margins are needed to understand this relationship fully.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue is relatively stable, but the high reported profit margins (70-72%) seem contradictory to the negative EPS figures.  This discrepancy requires further investigation to understand the accounting methods used.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has fluctuated and ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity.  The large negative ROE values (-55.77% in Q2 2024) are especially alarming.

**Significant inconsistencies exist between the reported profit margins and the negative EPS and ROE figures.  This needs clarification to accurately assess the financial health of the company.**

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Earnings News:**  No specific news was provided.
* **Market Outlook:** Not specified.
* **Analyst Opinions:** Not included.

This section needs additional data for a comprehensive analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is severely underperforming the market.  The company is experiencing significant losses, reflected in the consistently negative EPS and ROE. While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and downward price trends indicate a bearish outlook. The extremely negative expected return further reinforces the poor performance.  The provided financial information contains inconsistencies that need further explanation.  More information is needed regarding news, market outlook, and analyst opinions to complete the picture.  The extremely high profit margins reported in contrast to the negative EPS and ROE are particularly concerning and require further clarification.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the consistently negative EPS, negative ROE, and considerable underperformance against the market, additional investigation is crucial before considering any investment in TDOC.  The inconsistencies in the financial data need to be resolved.  Until a clearer picture emerges, it is advisable to exercise caution.  The current outlook is extremely negative.
