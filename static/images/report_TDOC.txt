## Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) provides virtual healthcare services.  Over the analyzed period, TDOC's cumulative return of -67.86% significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 118.33%.  The difference in performance is a substantial -186.2 percentage points. This places TDOC at the 3rd percentile (relative divergence of 0.3) compared to the historical range of S&P 500 performance against TDOC, indicating a significantly weaker performance.

The provided CAGR data reveals periods of exceptionally high growth followed by dramatic declines. The most recent years show overwhelmingly negative returns, highlighting the company's recent struggles.  The consistently high beta (around 2.0) indicates TDOC's high volatility and sensitivity to overall market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $9.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $9.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $9.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.76

The price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price change of -$0.76 (from the previous close) is a relatively small negative movement compared to the overall trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (40.91):**  Approaching oversold territory (below 30), but not quite there yet.  This suggests the stock might be nearing a potential bounce, but it's not a strong buy signal on its own.
* **PPO (-0.40):** Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-0.9):** This reinforces the bearish trend.  The recent price drop is relatively modest; a significant downward trend is apparent over the longer term, but there was no rapid drop.
* **Expected Return (-6813.2%):** This extremely negative figure suggests a very pessimistic outlook for future returns.  The extremely high negative value likely indicates a significant deviation, likely due to limitations or errors within the prediction methodology.  This warrants additional investigation and should not be interpreted as a reliable future projection. The extremely low price and poor performance need to be carefully considered. Long-term (2+ years) investment with a dollar cost averaging strategy might reduce risk but is highly speculative.  Significant risks remain.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent losses (negative EPS) throughout the reported quarters, although revenue remained relatively stable around $0.64-$0.66 billion. The large negative EPS value in August 2024 is particularly concerning and warrants further investigation.  This suggests the company is currently struggling with profitability and requires significant improvements to its business model.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable but profit margins, while high, are volatile.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity fluctuates, and the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its investments. This is a significant concern.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is currently experiencing significant challenges. Negative earnings, declining ROE, and a vastly underperforming stock price compared to the S&P 500 paint a bearish picture. While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, the underlying fundamentals, including persistent losses and negative ROE, are highly concerning.  The extremely low expected return highlights the extremely high risk associated with this investment.  Significant improvements in profitability and business model are needed before considering TDOC as a viable investment.  Any investment decision should be made only after thorough due diligence and consultation with a financial advisor.  The exceptionally high negative expected return number is unreliable and further investigation is warranted to determine the calculation method used to arrive at that value.
