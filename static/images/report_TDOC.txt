**7.  Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance is deeply concerning.  While the stock shows some short-term positive technical indicators, the overwhelmingly negative financial results (consistent losses, negative ROE, and a drastically negative expected return compared to the S&P 500) paint a grim picture. The high negative expected return suggests significant risk and low probability of outperforming the market in the long term.  Any investment decision should be made with extreme caution and a thorough understanding of the company's challenges in achieving profitability.  Further fundamental research is strongly recommended before considering an investment.
