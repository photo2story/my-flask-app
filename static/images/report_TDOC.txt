Over the analyzed period, TDOC significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a cumulative return of -69.55% compared to VOO's 83.58%.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

TDOC's current price is trading below its 5-day ($7.15), 20-day ($7.14), and significantly below its 60-day ($9.08) moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 45.62 is near the neutral level (50), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.  The PPO of 1.12 suggests a potential bullish momentum. The recent negative relative divergence (-0.7) indicates a short-term bearish trend. The MRI of 0.37 suggests a medium risk level. The projected long-term expected return of -3044.8% compared to the S&P 500 is extremely negative and warrants serious caution.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue        |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 2025-05-01 | -0.53   | 0.63 B$        |
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19   | 0.64 B$        |
| 2024-08-01 | -4.92   | 0.64 B$        |
| 2024-04-26 | -0.49   | 0.65 B$        |
| 2025-05-01 | -0.49   | 0.65 B$        |


The provided earnings data shows consistent negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses. While revenue remains relatively stable, the significant negative EPS raises concerns about the company's profitability. The large negative EPS in August 2024 warrants further investigation into potential one-off events or underlying business issues.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis. This lack of information significantly limits the ability to accurately assess the company's financial health and future prospects.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, displaying consistent losses and a declining market capitalization.  Technical indicators present a mixed signal, while the extremely negative long-term expected return is a major red flag.  The lack of key financial data further hinders a thorough assessment.  The consistently negative EPS and absence of crucial financial metrics suggest a high level of risk.  Based on this analysis, TDOC is not recommended for investment at this time.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the consistent losses and the missing financial data before considering any investment.  The extremely negative long-term return projection strongly suggests that TDOC is a high-risk investment with a significant potential for further losses.
