* **5-Day Moving Average:** $10.32
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $9.82

* **Expected Return:** -7153.8% (This extremely negative figure warrants careful scrutiny and likely reflects the substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the high risk involved.)  This extremely negative figure suggests very high risk and significantly low expected returns compared to the S&P 500.

The large negative change in price (-1.74%) indicates a recent drop, though not a dramatic crash.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19 | $0.64 B       |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92 | $0.64 B       |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49 | $0.65 B       |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35 | $0.66 B       |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35 | $0.66 B       |

The recent earnings show consistent losses with relatively stable revenue. The large negative EPS in August 2024 is an outlier and requires further investigation into the underlying causes.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72% |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.66B | 71.83% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77% |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58% |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24% |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.29B | -2.49% |

Revenue remains relatively stable, but the profitability (as indicated by profit margin) fluctuates.  More importantly, the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns for its shareholders. This is a major red flag.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC has experienced significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, showing substantial negative returns in recent years. While recent technical indicators hint at some bullish momentum, the consistently negative ROE and volatile earnings raise significant concerns. The extremely high negative expected return (-7153.8%) highlights the substantial risk associated with this investment.  A long-term investment strategy requires a thorough understanding of the reasons for the company's underperformance and a reassessment of its future prospects.  Further investigation into the causes of the August 2024 EPS loss is crucial before making any investment decision.  Currently, the data suggests TDOC is a high-risk investment with potentially very low returns compared to broader market indices.
