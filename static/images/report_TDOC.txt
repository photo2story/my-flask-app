**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of total revenue and gross profit data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  More data is needed for a proper assessment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC has severely underperformed the S&P 500, showing consistent negative returns in recent years.  While some technical indicators hint at potential short-term rebounds (RSI nearing oversold), the overall picture is bearish, particularly given the ongoing negative EPS and the lack of positive financial data. The extremely negative expected return underscores the substantial risk involved.  A long-term investment in TDOC at this time seems highly speculative and carries significant downside risk compared to the S&P 500.  More comprehensive financial data is crucial for a more thorough assessment.  Investors should exercise extreme caution.
