**Analysis:**

*   The negative change from the previous close indicates continued downward pressure.

**3. Index Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - This seems contradictory given other indicators. The MRI model might be oversimplified or lagging.
*   **RSI:** 30.58 - This indicates the stock is nearing oversold conditions (typically below 30).
*   **PPO:** -0.21 - The negative PPO suggests a downtrend is in place.

*   **Expected Return (%):** -10382.5 - This is an exceptionally negative projected return, suggesting extremely high risk or model errors.
    This number looks like an error.

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI suggests the stock might be approaching oversold conditions, potentially indicating a possible short-term bounce.
*   The MRI indicates the stock is suitable for investment. This is based on the signal "Very Safe", which is misleading.
*   The extremely negative "Expected Return" raises serious questions about the data or the model's accuracy. It suggests either an incredibly pessimistic outlook or a significant flaw in the calculation. This number should be treated with extreme caution. The Hybrid Signal shows that buying is recommended. It is also a misleading indicator.

*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 9.18 / 12.00 / 7.00

**Analysis:**

*   The analyst target prices suggest a potential upside from the current price, but the overall consensus is neutral, indicating a lack of strong conviction.

Based on the data, TDOC is a risky investment. While the RSI indicates a potential short-term bounce, the long-term trends and financial performance raise significant concerns.
