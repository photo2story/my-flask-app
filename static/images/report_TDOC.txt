**Analysis:**

*   **Early Growth, Recent Decline:** The company showed strong growth (high CAGR, positive Alpha) in the 2015-2020 period. Since 2019, the performance has been extremely poor with large negative CAGR and Alpha figures.
*   **Beta Shift:** Beta, measuring volatility relative to the market, has shifted from near zero and positive to negative.  This suggests TDOC became less correlated and negatively correlated with the S&P 500, possibly due to company-specific issues dominating its performance.
*   **Maximum Drawdown (MDD):** Consistently high MDD values indicate significant price declines during the respective periods.
*   **Capitalization Decline:**  The market capitalization (Cap) has decreased substantially in recent years, reflecting a loss of investor confidence.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** $7.0
*   **Last Market Data:** price: 7.0, previousClose: 6.93, change: 1.01
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 7.102
    *   20-day SMA: 7.3703
    *   60-day SMA: 7.8012

**Analysis:**

*   The recent small positive change indicates a slight rebound from the previous close.
*   The stock price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), which is generally considered a bearish signal. This suggests that the short-term, medium-term, and long-term trends are all downward.

**3) Market Risk Indicator (MRI) & Other Indicators**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended - 0.9~1.0)
*   **RSI:** 23.07 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.4232
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (132 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -10459.9%

**Analysis:**

*   **Contradictory Signals:** The MRI score suggests a "High Investment Recommended", but this contradicts almost every other indicator. *This high MRI score should be viewed with extreme skepticism.*  The high MRI is likely due to the parameters utilized.
*   **Oversold RSI:** The RSI indicates that the stock is oversold, which *could* suggest a potential for a short-term bounce.
*   **Negative PPO:**  The negative PPO indicates that the stock is in a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Although the hybrid signal is positive, it is contradicted by other indicators.
*   **Negative Divergence Change:** Recent divergence change of -0.4 indicates short-term decline.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative Headlines:** Several headlines are negative or concerning:
    *   "Forget Teladoc and Buy This Healthcare Stock Instead" - *The Motley Fool* - Suggests alternatives are more attractive.
    *   "HIMS vs. TDOC: Which Telehealth Stock Looks More Compelling?" - *Yahoo Finance* -  Puts TDOC in direct competition, which could be negative depending on the analysis within.
    *   "Voya Investment Management LLC Sells 99,728,586 Shares" - *MarketBeat* - Large institutional selling pressure is a very negative sign.
    *   "3 Volatile Stocks That Concern Us" - *Finviz* - Being highlighted as a volatile stock of concern raises red flags.
*   **Positive Headlines:** There is one recent positive headline.
    *   "Why Teladoc (TDOC) Stock Is Up Today" - *FinancialContent* - A minor positive signal, but needs to be considered in context of the other negative news.
*   **Neutral Headlines:**
    *   "(TDOC) Movement as an Input in Quant Signal Sets" - *Stock Traders Daily* - This simply states TDOC's movement is being analyzed.

**Analysis:**

*   **Overwhelmingly Negative Sentiment:** The recent news flow is predominantly negative, with concerns about competition, institutional selling, volatility, and being passed over for alternatives.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Negative sentiment
*   **Target Price:** The average target price of $9.18 is *above* the current price of $7.0, suggesting potential upside *if* analysts' expectations are met.  However, a low target of $7 is equivalent to the current price.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Rating changes are not provided.

**Analysis:**

*   **Mixed Signals:** The analyst target price offers some hope, but without knowing recent rating changes, it's hard to determine if the consensus is still valid or if analysts are revising their expectations downward.

*   **Bearish Technical Indicators:** The stock price is below key moving averages, and while the RSI suggests it's oversold, the PPO confirms a downtrend.
*   **Negative News Sentiment:** Recent news is overwhelmingly negative, with concerns about competition, institutional selling, and the company's overall prospects.
*   **Consistent Losses:** The company is consistently losing money, and equity is declining.
*   **High Profit Margins with negative ROE** The company has high profit margins (around 70%). Yet, the Return on Equity (ROE) is negative, reflecting the company's inability to generate profit from shareholders' investments.
*   **Contradictory Indicators:** The MRI score suggests "High Investment Recommended" which contradicts the negative hybrid signal.

**Conclusion:**

While the analyst target price suggests some potential upside, the preponderance of evidence points to significant risks associated with investing in TDOC at this time. **The strong negative signals outweigh the few positive indicators.** The company needs to demonstrate a clear path to profitability, address competitive concerns, and reverse the negative momentum in its stock price before it can be considered a worthwhile investment. The high MRI score seems to be an outlier in this context and should not be relied upon for investment decisions. Due to the inconsistent result, it is best to not invest in the TDOC and invest in better telehealth stock, such as HIMS.
