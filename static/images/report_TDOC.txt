This report analyzes Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC), a telehealth company providing virtual care services, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Teladoc has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The cumulative return for TDOC is -66.36%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 113.60%.  This represents a massive divergence of -180.0 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 0.9 indicates that this underperformance is near the lower extreme of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.515
* **Last Market Price:** $9.52
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $9.379
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $9.9598
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.7248

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing and last market price indicates minimal recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 38.51 -  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.01 - Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +0.9 - Shows a recent short-term upward trend, though this is likely influenced by the recent price movement and needs further context.
* **Expected Return:** -6339.3% - This extremely negative expected return highlights the significant risk associated with the stock, especially for long-term investment.  This likely reflects the historical underperformance and potential for further decline.  A 2-year+ horizon is highly speculative given the current situation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals a concerning trend:

* **Revenue:** Revenue has remained relatively flat around $0.64-$0.66B over the past four quarters, showing minimal growth.
* **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** EPS has consistently been negative, ranging from -$0.19 to -$4.92. This indicates significant losses, with a particularly large loss in Q2 2024 (-$4.92).  There is no information to compare these results against expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue is stagnant while profit margins are relatively high (70-72%), despite the negative EPS which suggests significant non-cash charges.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has fluctuated, and Return on Equity (ROE) has been consistently negative, ranging from -55.77% to -1.24%. This indicates the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or market outlook information was provided to analyze.  Lack of analyst opinions and performance highlights prevents a complete assessment of market sentiment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is currently experiencing significant challenges. The stock has severely underperformed the S&P 500, showing a substantial and prolonged decline.  Earnings reports reveal consistent losses and stagnant revenue, coupled with negative ROE, indicating significant financial distress. While the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the negative PPO and extremely negative expected return highlight significant risks.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the substantial losses and lack of revenue growth is crucial before considering any investment. The absence of recent news and analyst opinions limits a full assessment of current market sentiment and future prospects.  Without further context, the extremely negative expected return must be viewed with extreme caution.

**8.  Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, TDOC carries significant risk and warrants further, in-depth research before any investment consideration. The company's consistent losses, stagnant revenue, and negative ROE paint a concerning picture of its financial health.  The massive underperformance against the S&P 500 underscores the significant downside risk.  More information on the drivers of the Q2 2024 loss and the broader market context is needed to provide a more informed investment recommendation.
