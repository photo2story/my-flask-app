**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500, showing a persistent downtrend in price and negative ROE. While revenue remains relatively stable, consistent negative EPS and volatile profitability raise serious concerns.  The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity, amplifying both gains and losses. The extremely negative expected return (-2414.4%) warrants thorough investigation into its calculation methodology.  Long-term investment requires careful consideration of these negative factors, especially given the persistent losses. Before investing, deeper due diligence is crucial, including an analysis of the company's strategic direction and competitive landscape.  The provided data alone paints a bearish picture for TDOC.
