**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.56
* **Last Market Price:** $9.815 (a 2.67% increase from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $10.52
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $11.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $10.60

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent small price increase might be a temporary bounce.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.4 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, but not necessarily a strong buy signal.)
* **PPO:** -4.01 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.6 (Shows a recent decrease in relative strength)
* **Expected Return:** -7852.1% (This extremely negative expected return indicates a very high risk and strongly suggests against long-term investment at the current valuation unless significant changes in the company's fundamentals occur.)

The recent price change of 2.67% reflects a minor bounce but is not significant enough to alter the overall bearish trend. The extremely negative expected return highlights significant risk.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19  | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92  | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49  | $0.65 B      |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35  | $0.66 B      |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35  | $0.66 B      |


Consistent negative EPS indicates persistent losses. Revenue remains relatively stable, but without profitability, the company's sustainability is questionable. The August 2024 EPS is particularly alarming.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B    | 70.50%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B    | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B    | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B    | 69.89%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B    | 70.72%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity    | ROE          |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B    | -3.25%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B    | -2.21%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B    | -55.77%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B    | -3.58%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B    | -1.24%        |

While revenue shows stability,  the negative ROE across all recent quarters points to significant losses and a deteriorating financial position.  The substantial drop in equity and the extremely negative ROE in Q2 2024 are serious concerns.  The high profit margin is misleading given the negative EPS.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance has been extremely poor compared to the S&P 500, showing consistent losses and a significant decline in value.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The company's financial health is deteriorating, with negative EPS and ROE indicating a lack of profitability and potential solvency issues.  The extremely negative projected return strongly advises against long-term investment unless there is a substantial improvement in the company's fundamentals and a clear turnaround strategy.  Further investigation into the cause of the substantial losses and the company's future outlook is crucial before any investment consideration.
