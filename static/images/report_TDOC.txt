| **Total**  |       |       |       |       |        | **-63.26%**           | **126.15%**          | **-189.41%**       |


As of the last data point, TDOC's cumulative return is -63.26%, while VOO's is 126.15%.  The difference is a significant -189.41%.  The relative divergence of -189.41 falls within the historical range (max: 728.82, min: -195.27), indicating a substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500. The high beta values suggest significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $10.63
* 5-day Moving Average: $9.60
* 20-day Moving Average: $9.33
* 60-day Moving Average: $8.83

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, the relatively small gap between the averages indicates a lack of strong momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* RSI: 69.21 (Approaching overbought territory)
* PPO: 0.98 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* 20-day Relative Divergence Change: +0.52 (Short-term upward trend)
* Expected Return (2+ years): 0.0% (This suggests that based on current data, no outperformance is expected relative to the S&P 500 in the long term.  This requires further investigation and should not be taken as definitive).

The closing price of $10.63 reflects a recent price increase, but not a dramatic jump that would qualify as a "sharp rebound."


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

| Date         | EPS     | Revenue (B$) |
|--------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31   | -0.19   | 0.64          |
| 2024-08-01   | -4.92   | 0.64          |
| 2024-04-26   | -0.49   | 0.65          |
| 2023-10-27   | -0.35   | 0.66          |
| 2024-10-31   | -0.35   | 0.66          |


The company shows consistent losses (negative EPS) despite relatively stable revenue. The August 2024 EPS is exceptionally low, suggesting a potential one-time event or outlier that should be further investigated to understand the cause.  A comparison to analyst expectations for the most recent quarter is needed for a complete assessment.


**6. Financial Information:**

**1) Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | 0.64          | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30  | 0.64          | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31  | 0.65          | 69.89%        |
| 2023-12-31  | 0.66          | 70.72%        |
| 2023-09-30  | 0.66          | 71.83%        |

High profit margins are observed, which is positive; however, these are based on the revenue generated, and the company is still posting a net loss. This suggests that there are significant expenses that need to be addressed to attain profitability.

**2) Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|--------------|---------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30  | 1.51          | -2.21   |
| 2024-06-30  | 1.50          | -55.77  |
| 2024-03-31  | 2.29          | -3.58   |
| 2023-12-31  | 2.33          | -1.24   |
| 2023-09-30  | 2.29          | -2.49   |

Negative ROE across all quarters indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity investment.  The significant drop in ROE during Q2 2024 (-55.77%) requires further investigation.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires access to real-time news sources like Shacknews and Finbold to provide an up-to-date analysis of recent earnings news, market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights. Please provide relevant news articles for a complete assessment.)*

**8. Summary:**

TDOC is significantly underperforming the S&P 500, showing considerable losses despite relatively stable revenue and high profit margins.  The high beta suggests high volatility. While recent price action shows a minor upward trend, the negative EPS, negative ROE, and a 0% projected long-term excess return relative to the S&P 500 raise serious concerns.  Further analysis is required to understand the causes behind the August 2024 EPS outlier and the Q2 2024 ROE drop.  A thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a complete assessment of the investment potential.
