## Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) Stock Performance Review

**0. Executive Summary:** Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC), a provider of telehealth services, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the past several years, exhibiting substantial negative returns.  Recent financial data shows mixed results, with consistent revenue but fluctuating and largely negative profitability metrics. The stock currently trades below its moving averages, indicating bearish momentum.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Teladoc Health (TDOC) experienced a cumulative return of -65.90% while the S&P 500 (VOO) achieved a cumulative return of 112.82%.  This represents a significant divergence of -178.7%, placing it at the 1.1 percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum divergence of -188.5% and a maximum of 710.6%).


The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta analysis reveals periods of extremely high growth followed by sharp declines.  High Beta values indicate significant sensitivity to market movements, which explains the substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 during bearish market conditions. The consistently negative Alpha values in recent years suggest underperformance relative to the market benchmark, even accounting for risk.



**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.5
* **Previous Close:** $10.99
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $10.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $11.92
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $10.64

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The recent price drop of -13.56% represents a significant short-term decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 38.90  (Below 50, indicating bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -3.51 (Negative value, confirming bearish trend)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.2 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -7062.5% (This extremely negative value suggests a very pessimistic outlook.  It's crucial to understand the methodology behind this calculation and its limitations. A -7062.5% projected return is likely not realistic.)


Given the significant negative change in price (-13.56%), a notable short-term decline is evident. The extremely negative expected return should be treated with caution and warrants further investigation into its calculation and assumptions.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19 | $0.64 B     |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92 | $0.64 B     |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49 | $0.65 B     |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35 | $0.66 B     |
| 2023-10-31 | -$0.35 | $0.66 B     |


Revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64 - $0.66B, but earnings per share (EPS) are consistently negative and highly volatile, indicating significant losses.  The August 2024 EPS is particularly alarming.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B  | 70.73%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B  | 69.89%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B  | 70.72%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.66B  | 71.83%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity  | ROE       |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58%    |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24%    |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.29B | -2.49%    |


While revenue remains relatively stable and profit margins are high, the negative and fluctuating Return on Equity (ROE) is a significant concern, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital. The extremely negative ROE in Q2 2024 is a major red flag.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance is highly concerning.  While revenue remains relatively stable, significant and consistent losses, highly volatile EPS, negative ROE, and substantial underperformance against the S&P 500 paint a bleak picture.  The negative technical indicators and the extremely negative (and likely unrealistic) projected return further reinforce the bearish sentiment.  A long-term investment strategy for TDOC requires careful consideration of the substantial risks involved and a thorough understanding of the company's turnaround strategy.  Further investigation into the causes of the significant losses and the validity of the -7062.5% projected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility and negative Alpha suggest that even a long-term strategy carries considerable risk.
