**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) is a telehealth company providing virtual healthcare services.  As of the last data point provided, TDOC's cumulative return is -58.45%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has a cumulative return of 126.88%.  This represents a significant divergence of -185.3 percentage points.  The relative divergence indicator of 1.1 suggests TDOC's performance is near the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR data shows high growth in the periods 2015-2020, but sharply negative returns in the following years.  This highlights significant volatility and a recent downturn in performance.  The Beta values consistently above 1 indicate higher volatility than the overall market (S&P 500).  Alpha values fluctuate, indicating periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market risk.

* **Closing Price:** $12.02 (Last market: $11.47)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $10.19
* **20-day Moving Average:** $9.47
* **60-day Moving Average:** $8.91

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The jump from the last market close to the current close indicates a potential short-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI (75.22):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (2.24):** A positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (0.8 +):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend relative to the S&P 500.

Given the current price of $12.02 compared to the last market price of $11.47, there's a modest but noticeable uptick. While not a sharp jump, it warrants monitoring for further confirmation of a potential trend reversal. The expected return of 0.0% suggests that at current valuations, long-term returns are not expected to significantly outpace the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows consistent negative EPS throughout the period. While revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64-$0.66B, the significant negative EPS indicates persistent losses.  The lack of an earnings estimate for the most recent period prevents a full comparative analysis.  Further research into analyst estimates is needed for a complete outlook.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins, while high, are not indicative of profitability due to significant negative EPS.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Negative ROE values across all quarters indicate the company is not generating returns on equity.  This is a significant concern. The large fluctuation in equity (Quarter 2024-03-31 compared to 2024-06-30) requires further investigation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* *(This section requires information from recent news sources such as Shacknews and Finbold.

A lack of positive news regarding profitability and a turnaround strategy would further support the concerns raised above.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is currently experiencing a period of significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While recent price action shows some upward momentum, the company is facing significant challenges, including consistent negative EPS and negative ROE.  Overbought RSI levels suggest caution.  The stable revenue needs to translate to profitability.  A thorough analysis of recent news and analyst opinions, including a detailed review of the reasons for the recent price movements and any potential catalysts for a turnaround, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The lack of a positive expected return compared to the S&P 500 further underscores the need for caution.  The current situation warrants further investigation and a more cautious approach. The negative EPS and negative ROE are significant red flags.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current financial situation and market performance, a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy in TDOC carries significant risk.  Further research into the company's turnaround strategy and analyst forecasts is strongly recommended before considering any investment.  The information suggests that TDOC is not currently a strong candidate for outperforming the S&P 500.  Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance before investing in this volatile stock.  Consider diversifying your portfolio to mitigate risk.
