* **Closing Price:** $7.33
* **5-day Moving Average:** $7.20
* **20-day Moving Average:** $7.23
* **60-day Moving Average:** $9.25

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price increase of 2.37% from the previous close might indicate a temporary bounce, but further observation is needed to confirm a reversal of the downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.379 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 52.72 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.335 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but needs context of historical values)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -1.1 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (vs S&P 500, long-term):** -2497.0%  This extremely negative value suggests a very significant underperformance expectation relative to the S&P 500 for the long term if current trends continue. This should be treated with caution as it is potentially an outlier or impacted by extreme volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows consistently negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  Revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64 - $0.66B, but without profitability, this is not sustainable for long-term growth.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19 | 0.64 B$ |
| 2024-08-01 | -4.92 | 0.64 B$ |
| 2024-04-26 | -0.49 | 0.65 B$ |
| 2023-10-27 | -0.35 | 0.66 B$ |
| 2024-10-31 | -0.35 | 0.66 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, but profit margins are high, partially offsetting the negative impact of negative EPS. The capital and profitability data raises major concerns.  ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on its shareholders' equity.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B | 70.50% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B | -3.25% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77% |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58% |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting high volatility and consistently negative earnings. While revenue remains relatively stable, the negative ROE and consistently negative EPS are major concerns. The short-term price action shows weakness, and long-term prospects are uncertain without a clear path to profitability. The extremely negative projected long-term return (-2497%) should be interpreted cautiously and requires further investigation to confirm its validity.  Further analysis is needed to evaluate the long-term viability and potential for a turnaround in the company's performance.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with this investment.
