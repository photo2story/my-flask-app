* **PPO:** 0.64 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -0.4 (Short-term downward trend)

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19  | $0.64B        |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92  | $0.64B        |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49  | $0.65B        |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35  | $0.66B        |
| 2023-10-31 | -$0.35  | $0.66B        | *(Likely a duplicate entry)*


The company consistently reports negative EPS. While revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64-$0.66B, the significant negative earnings raise serious concerns about profitability and long-term sustainability.  The extremely negative EPS in August 2024 is a major outlier that needs further investigation.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B   | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B   | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B   | 69.89%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B   | 70.72%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.66B   | 71.83%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE           |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B   | -2.21%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B   | -55.77%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B   | -3.58%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B   | -1.24%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.29B   | -2.49%        |


The high profit margins are deceptive in light of the negative ROE, suggesting a fundamental problem in capital efficiency and profitability. The drastic drop in ROE in Q2 2024 needs thorough explanation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance is significantly lagging the market. While recent price movements show some short-term improvement, the consistently negative EPS, highly volatile performance, and alarmingly negative expected return present significant risks for investors.  The high profit margins are offset by a negative ROE, indicating a serious concern with the business model's efficiency.  Further investigation is crucial to understand the causes of the extreme negative EPS in August 2024 and the volatility of the return metrics.  At present, this stock appears to be a high-risk investment.  The -6945.6% expected return is likely an error and should not be relied upon.  A thorough due diligence process is absolutely necessary before considering any investment.
