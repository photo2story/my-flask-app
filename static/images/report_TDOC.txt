* **Expected Return:** -4326.4% (This extremely negative value is likely an error and needs clarification. A negative expected return indicates the model predicts significant losses.)
  The -2.45% price change reflects a minor downward correction after a period of downward movement, not a dramatic crash.

| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24% |

Analysis: Revenue is relatively flat, while profit margins are consistently high (though this needs to be considered in the light of negative EPS).  ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity. This is a significant concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is currently experiencing significant challenges. While it shows high profit margins,  consistent negative EPS and ROE highlight a fundamental issue with profitability. The stock price has severely underperformed the market, and technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  The extremely negative expected return needs further investigation and clarification.  Before considering any investment, a thorough review of the company's strategic direction and its ability to achieve profitability is crucial.  The high profit margins are counterintuitive given the considerable losses, and this discrepancy needs further explanation.  The extremely negative projected return (-4326.4%) is almost certainly an error and should be disregarded.  A more reliable assessment of long-term potential would require a more sophisticated financial model and additional qualitative analysis.
