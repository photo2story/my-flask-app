*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 18.52 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -2.06 (Below zero, indicating a downtrend, but not extremely oversold)

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI is deeply oversold, suggesting a potential for a short-term bounce.
*   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment Recommended," which seems optimistic given the other indicators.
*   The Hybrid Signal is confusing because the MRI (0.90) used in signal generation is different with the MRI value (0.8).
*   A significant price decrease from previous close (-2.12) indicate a continuous down trend with considering oversold (RSI).
*   The extremely negative expected return indicates that despite the oversold conditions, the model predicts continued long-term underperformance versus the S&P 500.
