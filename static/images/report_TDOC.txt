**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) is facing significant challenges. The stock has substantially underperformed the S&P 500, displaying a large negative divergence. While revenue has remained relatively stable, the company struggles with profitability, as evidenced by negative EPS and ROE. Recent news is mixed, with some positive ratings offset by insider selling. Analyst consensus is neutral, with a target price suggesting a potential upside, but the extremely negative Expected Return indicates significant risks. The technical indicators are bearish, with the stock trading below its moving averages.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the negative financial performance, underperformance against the market, mixed news, and negative return indicators, investing in TDOC is highly risky at this time. A wait-and-see approach is warranted. A potential investor should monitor the company's ability to achieve profitability and demonstrate consistent growth before considering an investment.
