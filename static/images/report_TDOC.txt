**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Teladoc Health (TDOC) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for TDOC is -64.33%, while VOO's is 52.12%. This represents a substantial divergence of **-116.4%**. The provided relative divergence of 0.5 indicates TDOC's performance is closer to the lower bound of its historical range relative to VOO.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.8405

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some recent upward momentum, but still below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.  The recent price drop of $0.05 (-0.49%) reflects a minor negative change.

* **PPO:** 0.85 – A positive PPO suggests potential bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.1 – Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -1722.5% – This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is alarming and reflects the significant underperformance observed.  This casts serious doubt on the viability of a long-term investment strategy in TDOC compared to VOO.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows consistently negative EPS, indicating significant losses. While revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64 - $0.66B, the company's inability to translate this revenue into profits is a major concern.  The substantial discrepancy between EPS figures for the same quarters (e.g., 2024-10-31) raises questions about data accuracy or reporting inconsistencies.  Clarification is needed.


| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19 | $0.64B      |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92 | $0.64B      |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49 | $0.65B      |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35 | $0.66B      |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35 | $0.66B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, but profitability is a significant concern.  Profit margins are high (70-72%), but this is likely due to extremely low or negative EPS. This high profit margin is misleading without context of the negative EPS.

Capital and Profitability data reveal a concerning trend of declining equity and negative ROE, indicating financial difficulties.  The significant swings in equity from one quarter to the next warrant further investigation.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B  | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B  | 69.89%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B  | 70.72%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.66B  | 71.83%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE       |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B   | -2.21%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B   | -55.77%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B   | -3.58%    |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Teladoc Health (TDOC) presents a highly risky investment proposition.  The persistent negative EPS, declining equity, negative ROE, and significantly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 paint a bleak picture. While the recent price shows some minor upward movement,  the longer-term trend indicates substantial underperformance.  The high Beta suggests significant volatility.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution and thoroughly investigate the reasons behind the inconsistent earnings data and the company's ongoing financial struggles before considering any investment.  Further investigation into the business model and competitive landscape is crucial.
