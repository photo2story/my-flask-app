## Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) is a telehealth company providing virtual care services.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, exhibiting high volatility and negative returns. Recent financial data shows mixed results, with relatively stable revenue but inconsistent profitability and equity.  Further analysis is required to determine the long-term investment potential.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

TDOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The cumulative return for TDOC is -70.77%, while VOO shows a 71.74% return. This represents a divergence of -142.5, placing it in the 4.7th percentile of historical divergence based on the provided min/max range (-171.5 to 447.1).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and inconsistent performance. While CAGR was initially high, it turned sharply negative in recent years.  The high beta values (especially in 2017-2020) indicate high sensitivity to market movements. The consistently negative Alpha since 2019-2021 further underscores underperformance relative to the market.  The shrinking market capitalization is also concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $6.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $6.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $7.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.51

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price increase (5.99% from the previous close) might be a temporary bounce.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.39 (Suggests the stock is potentially oversold, but caution is advised given the overall trend.)
* **PPO:** -0.1965 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.2 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -1858.9% (This extremely negative figure suggests a significantly lower expected return than the S&P 500 over the long term.  This needs further investigation as it's unusually low and may reflect a flaw in the calculation methodology).  The significant price change from the previous day (5.99%) could be a short-term fluctuation and not indicative of a significant reversal.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19 | $0.64 B     |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92 | $0.64 B     |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49 | $0.65 B     |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35 | $0.66 B     |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35 | $0.66 B     |


Earnings are consistently negative, indicating significant losses. Revenue remains relatively stable, but the substantial EPS losses are extremely concerning.  The unusual repetition of the October 31st data requires clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B  | 70.50%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B  | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B  | 69.89%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B  | 70.72%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity  | ROE      |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B  | -3.25%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B  | -2.21%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B  | -55.77%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B  | -3.58%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B  | -1.24%   |

Revenue is relatively stable, yet the high profit margins contrast sharply with the consistently negative ROE. This discrepancy requires further investigation into the company's financial structure and accounting practices.  The extremely negative ROE in Q2 2024 is particularly alarming.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance has been deeply disappointing, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  While the recent price increase provides a momentary reprieve,  the underlying financial health is concerning due to persistent losses, inconsistent profitability, and a drastically negative ROE in certain quarters.   The extremely low expected return (-1858.9%)  is a red flag and requires careful review of its calculation method.  Further in-depth research is needed to understand the reasons behind the negative earnings and the seemingly conflicting high profit margins with the negative ROE.  Based on the current data, a long-term investment in TDOC carries substantial risk.  A more thorough investigation into the company's strategy, competitive landscape, and future outlook is necessary before making any investment decisions.
