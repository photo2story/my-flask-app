**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is currently experiencing significant challenges. The stock has severely underperformed the market, showing consistent losses and negative ROE.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the underlying business fundamentals are weak.  The extremely negative expected return highlights substantial risk.  While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, a long-term investment in TDOC carries substantial downside risk without significant improvement in the company's financial performance and business strategy.  Further investigation into the -1735.3% expected return calculation is crucial before making any investment decisions.
