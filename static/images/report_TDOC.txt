**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

TDOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While it showed strong growth potential in the past, recent financial performance has been poor, with negative earnings, declining equity, and negative ROE. The stock is currently oversold, and news headlines are mixed. Analysts have a consensus "Hold" rating, but the average price target is higher than the current price. Recent divergence suggests an upward trend, but its negative expected return raises concerns. Investors should carefully consider the high risk and poor recent performance before investing in TDOC. While the partnership with TytoCare and high profit margins are positive signs, the company needs to address its profitability and reverse the trend of declining equity.
