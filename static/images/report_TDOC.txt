**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19 | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92 | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49 | $0.65 B      |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35 | $0.66 B      |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35 | $0.66 B      |

Revenue remains relatively stable, but EPS shows significant losses in several quarters, particularly in Q2 2024 with an exceptionally large negative EPS. This warrants further investigation into the underlying reasons for these substantial losses.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B | 70.50%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72%       |

Revenue is relatively consistent across the reported quarters, but the high profit margins do not translate into positive EPS.  This discrepancy requires investigation into the company's cost structure and expense management.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE       |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B | -3.25%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58%    |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24%    |

Equity shows some fluctuation, but the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital. The exceptionally low ROE in Q2 2024 (-55.77%) requires further analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance is extremely concerning.  While revenue remains relatively stable, the company is consistently unprofitable, exhibiting substantial losses in earnings per share.  The extremely negative expected return, coupled with the negative ROE and bearish technical indicators, paints a grim picture for the stock's short-to-medium term prospects. The high volatility and inconsistent performance history suggest significant risk.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the large negative EPS figures and the persistently negative ROE.  The current oversold RSI suggests a potential bounce, but the underlying fundamental issues need to be resolved before a significant recovery is likely.  The high negative expected return calculation necessitates a thorough review of the methodology and assumptions used.  Long-term investment requires a careful evaluation of the company's strategic direction and ability to address its profitability challenges.
