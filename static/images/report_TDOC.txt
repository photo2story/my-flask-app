## Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) Stock Review

**0. Overview:** Teladoc Health Inc. is a virtual healthcare company providing telehealth services.

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Teladoc (TDOC) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for TDOC is -66.77%, while VOO shows a 58.95% return. This results in a substantial divergence of -125.7%, placing it at the 5.5th percentile of the historical range (-159.2% to 454.5%).  The provided alpha and beta analysis reveals high beta values (generally above 3), indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The consistently negative alpha in recent years suggests underperformance relative to the market.  Note that the high beta values in the earlier years likely contributed significantly to the high CAGR figures in those years.  The dramatic decrease in the CAGR and increasingly negative alphas in recent years shows a significant deterioration in performance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19  | $0.64 B     |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92  | $0.64 B     |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49  | $0.65 B     |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35  | $0.66 B     |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35  | $0.66 B     |

There's a clear pattern of negative EPS, suggesting consistent losses. Revenue remains relatively stable, but the significant losses are a major concern. The August 2024 EPS is exceptionally poor.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B | 70.50% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72% |

Revenue is relatively consistent. Profit margins are high, but this is misleading due to the negative earnings per share.  A high profit margin with negative EPS suggests significant accounting issues or non-GAAP accounting is being used.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE     |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B | -3.25%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77% |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24%  |

Negative ROE across all quarters indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity.  The significantly negative ROE in Q2 2024 is especially concerning.


**6.  Overall Analysis:**

Teladoc's performance has been extremely poor, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  Negative EPS, despite relatively stable revenue, points to significant underlying issues.  High beta and negative alpha suggest high volatility and consistent underperformance relative to the market. Technical indicators paint a bearish picture, with the price below all major moving averages.  While the RSI is approaching oversold levels, this does not guarantee a reversal. The extremely negative projected return highlights the significant risk involved.  **A long-term (2+ years) investment in TDOC at this time carries extremely high risk and low probability of outperforming the S&P 500.**  Further investigation into the causes of the negative EPS and the high profit margin with negative EPS is essential before considering any investment.  The provided financial information should be carefully scrutinized and compared to industry peers to better understand the true financial health of the company.
