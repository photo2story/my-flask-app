## Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**  This report analyzes Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC), a virtual healthcare provider, based on provided financial and performance data.  Key metrics including return rates, moving averages, technical indicators, and financial statements are examined to assess the company's current state and potential future performance.


**1) Performance Comparison:**

Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the unspecified period.  The cumulative return for TDOC was -69.47%, while VOO achieved a cumulative return of 83.10%. This represents a substantial divergence of -152.6%, placing it at the 3.1 percentile of the historical range (-171.5% to 447.1%).

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD) data show high volatility and significant negative returns in recent years, especially from 2019 onwards.  While early years displayed impressive growth, the substantial negative alpha in the last few years indicates underperformance relative to the market (represented by the beta). The decreasing Beta suggests decreasing market sensitivity over the period.  The sharply declining market capitalization further emphasizes the company's struggles.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2015-2017  | 76.0% | 60.6% | 49.0% | 0.0 | 6.1 |
| 2016-2018  | 128.0% | 59.3% | 109.0% | 0.0 | 8.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 176.0% | 59.3% | 145.0% | 0.4 | 14.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 237.0% | 64.0% | 208.0% | 0.2 | 35.2 |
| 2019-2021  | -83.0% | 64.0% | -141.0% | 0.2 | 16.2 |
| 2020-2022  | -295.0% | 81.3% | -303.0% | 0.0 | 4.2 |

**2) Recent Price Action:**

The closing price is $7.08, slightly below the last market price of $7.11.  The stock price is trading below its 5-day ($6.99), 20-day ($7.06), and significantly below its 60-day ($8.68) moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.37 suggests a medium-low risk level.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 54.98 indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but leaning slightly towards neutral territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.83 suggests bullish momentum, although this needs to be considered in the context of the overall downtrend.
* **Relative Divergence:** A recent decrease in relative strength (-0.2) points to a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:**  The expected return of -2969.3% is extremely negative. This indicates a very high risk and suggests substantial losses are projected, especially when comparing against the S&P 500's anticipated return.  This extremely negative value needs further clarification regarding the calculation method and assumptions.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy in this context carries significant risk.  The current price increase of 0.42 is not substantial enough to indicate any significant reversal of the trend.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals consistent negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) over the past year. While revenue has remained relatively stable around $0.64B-$0.65B, the significant negative EPS highlights major profitability issues.

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출       |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-05-01 | -0.53 | 0.63 B$    |
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19 | 0.64 B$    |
| 2024-08-01 | -4.92 | 0.64 B$    |
| 2024-04-26 | -0.49 | 0.65 B$    |
| 2025-05-01 | -0.49 | 0.65 B$    |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable, but profitability, as indicated by profit margin, is also relatively stable yet remains high. However, the capital and profitability metrics paint a concerning picture.  Equity has fluctuated, and ROE (Return on Equity) has been consistently negative, suggesting the company is not generating sufficient returns on its investments.  The drastically negative ROE in 2024-06-30 requires further investigation.


| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $0.63B  | 68.73%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B  | 70.50%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B  | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B  | 69.89%        |

| Quarter     | Equity   | ROE       |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-03-31 | $1.43B  | -6.52%    |
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B  | -3.25%    |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B  | -2.21%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B  | -55.77%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B  | -3.58%    |


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

TDOC's performance has been severely underwhelming compared to the S&P 500.  Consistent negative EPS, fluctuating equity, and consistently negative ROE highlight significant financial challenges. While revenue remains relatively stable, the company's inability to translate this revenue into profit is a major concern. The technical indicators offer mixed signals, but the overall downtrend and extremely negative expected return suggest significant risk for investors.  Further investigation into the causes of the negative ROE and the extremely negative projected return is crucial before making any investment decisions. The extremely negative expected return (-2969.3%) warrants extreme caution and further investigation into its calculation methodology and underlying assumptions.  The high profit margin in contrast to the negative ROE and EPS warrants deeper analysis.  Considering the significant losses in recent years and the concerning financial data, a long-term investment in TDOC should be approached with extreme caution.
