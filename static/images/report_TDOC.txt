*   **Beta:** A beta of -0.1 suggests that TDOC's price movement has a very weak negative correlation to the market. This means it tends to move opposite to the market, but to a very small degree.

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)

**Analysis:**

*   The high MRI (0.9) contradicts the other indicators, suggesting the model might be overly optimistic or lagging.
*   The RSI is well below 30, indicating the stock is oversold and *could* be due for a bounce. However, oversold conditions can persist for extended periods.
*   The PPO is negative, confirming the downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal is calling for a full investment, but with a "Very Safe" label that seems questionable given the negative indicators. The model is indicating a "buy" signal but it should be carefully considered given other negative factors.
*   The "Recent relative divergence change" of 0.1 with the label "Short-term rise" suggests a potential, minor positive shift.
*   The extremely negative "Expected Return (%)" of -10475.2% is very alarming and highlights the high risk associated with this stock.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news headlines present a mixed picture.
    *   **Negative:** "Forget Teladoc and Buy This Healthcare Stock Instead," "3 Volatile Stocks That Concern Us," "Teladoc Health: Fading Hope" indicate serious concerns.  The article about a CLO selling shares is also a negative signal.
    *   **Positive:** "Why Teladoc (TDOC) Stock Is Up Today" suggests some positive catalysts exist.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Teladoc Health (TDOC) faces significant challenges:

*   **Poor Performance:** It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and has a negative CAGR.
*   **High Risk:** The high maximum drawdown and negative alpha indicate high risk.
*   **Downtrend:** The stock is in a short-term downtrend and is trading below its moving averages.
*   **Oversold (Maybe):** The RSI suggests the stock is oversold, but this doesn't guarantee a rebound.
*   **Negative Sentiment:** News headlines and analysts express concern about the company's prospects.
*   **Unprofitable:** The company has consistently reported negative EPS and ROE and its revenue has been stagnant.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, investing in Teladoc Health appears to be a **high-risk** proposition. The negative indicators, poor performance, and negative sentiment outweigh the potential for a short-term bounce. The MRI indicator contradicts other information and may be misleading. The hybrid signal's "buy" recommendation should be treated with extreme caution. Further research and due diligence are absolutely necessary before considering any investment in this stock.
