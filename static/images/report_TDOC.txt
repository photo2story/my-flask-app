## Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) Stock Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) is a telehealth company providing virtual healthcare services.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing substantial negative returns.  Recent financial performance reveals consistent revenue but negative EPS and fluctuating profitability.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment. Long-term investment requires careful consideration of the company's turnaround strategy.

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

TDOC's cumulative return of -69.54% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's return of 79.12%. The difference of -148.7% places it at the 3.7th percentile of the historical range of the difference between TDOC and VOO's return.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly volatile performance, swinging between extremely high positive CAGR to extremely negative ones.  The consistently high Beta (above 1 for most periods) highlights significant market sensitivity.  Negative Alpha values in recent years indicate underperformance compared to the benchmark.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $7.2
* **5-day Moving Average:** $6.99
* **20-day Moving Average:** $7.31
* **60-day Moving Average:** $9.35

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price change (-0.83%) indicates a minor downward movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.39 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 48.52 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.93 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but needs further context)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.0 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -2414.4% (This extremely negative value likely reflects the significant historical underperformance and high risk associated with the stock. It should not be taken literally as a prediction.)

The negative price change of -0.83%  is not significant enough to classify as a sharp drop. The extremely negative expected return highlights the substantial risk associated with this investment.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS data shows consistent negative earnings per share across all reported quarters. While revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64-$0.66 billion,  the significant negative EPS indicates substantial losses.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative EPS is crucial.

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains fairly consistent across the quarters. However, the profit margin, while high,  doesn't reflect the negative EPS.  The "Capital and Profitability" section reveals significant fluctuations in Equity and notably negative Return on Equity (ROE) across several quarters. The consistently negative ROE is a major concern, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC has experienced significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, characterized by negative returns, high volatility, and negative EPS. While revenue remains relatively stable, the company is losing money.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to bearish short-term trend.  The high Beta highlights market sensitivity, and the negative Alpha confirms the underperformance compared to the benchmark. The extremely negative projected return emphasizes the considerable risk involved.  Long-term investment in TDOC requires a thorough understanding of the company's turnaround strategy and a high risk tolerance.  Further due diligence, including analysis of the reasons behind consistent losses and the future prospects of the telehealth industry, is strongly recommended before making any investment decision.
