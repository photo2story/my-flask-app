## Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) Stock Review

This report analyzes Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC), a telehealth company providing virtual healthcare services.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Teladoc's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500.  The difference between Teladoc's -67.15% and the S&P 500's 118.35% return amounts to a staggering **185.5 percentage point** underperformance.  The provided relative divergence of 0.3 places it near the lower bound of its historical range against the S&P 500. The high volatility is reflected in the large swings of the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) shown in the table. While past CAGRs were impressively high,  recent years show extreme negative growth.  This underscores the significant risk associated with this stock.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.45
* **5-day Moving Average:** $9.36
* **20-day Moving Average:** $10.2855
* **60-day Moving Average:** $9.6988

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 31.85 - This indicates the stock is in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.63 - This negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.2 - Shows a recent short-term relative decline.
* **Expected Return:** -6268.4% - This extremely negative figure indicates a high risk of significant further losses. The provided -6268.4% number needs further clarification on the calculation method as it seems unrealistically low.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy should be approached with extreme caution given the current negative outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistent trend of negative EPS and relatively flat revenue.  While revenue is relatively stable around $0.64-$0.66 billion, the EPS has been consistently negative and significantly worsened from Q2 2024 (-$4.92) compared to the rest of the reported quarters, indicating potential issues with profitability and cost management.  There is no information about expectations to compare the results against.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue remains relatively stable but shows no significant growth.
* **Profit Margin:** While the profit margin is high, it's critical to note that this is based on a negative EPS.  The high profit margin is likely due to low costs, not high revenue growth.
* **Equity and ROE (Return on Equity):**  Equity has fluctuated and the ROE is consistently negative, implying the company is not generating returns on its shareholders' investment.  This is a significant cause for concern.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This information was not provided in the initial data.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Teladoc Health is currently experiencing significant challenges. The stock has severely underperformed the S&P 500, showing consistently negative EPS and a negative ROE. While the RSI suggests an oversold condition, which could indicate a potential bounce, the extremely negative expected return and the overall financial trends paint a very pessimistic picture.  The extremely high profit margin despite substantial losses suggests possible accounting concerns which need further investigation.  The lack of revenue growth coupled with consistently negative earnings suggests significant underlying business problems.  Any investment decision should consider these critical risks.  More information on recent news and analyst sentiment is crucial for a more complete assessment.

**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the consistently negative performance, extreme volatility, and lack of clear signs of a turnaround,  a strong recommendation against investing in TDOC at this time is made.  A significant improvement in the company's financial performance and a clearer path to profitability are needed before considering an investment.  Further investigation into the unusually high reported profit margins is critical.  Investors should proceed with extreme caution, if at all, and seek professional financial advice before making any investment decisions.
