*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** MDD has been consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is overwhelmingly negative in recent periods, meaning TDOC has significantly underperformed its benchmark even when adjusted for risk.

*   **5-day SMA:** \$7.06
*   **20-day SMA:** \$7.36
*   **60-day SMA:** \$7.79

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA). This *generally* suggests a downward trend, though the differences are relatively small, suggesting the downward trend might be weakening or consolidating. The close price being the same as the previousClose suggests very little price movement.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 23.26 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.41
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (133 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI suggests the investment is considered lower risk, *according to this specific model*. This seems contradictory given the other indicators and poor historical performance. It is important to understand what factors contribute to this high MRI.
*   **RSI:**  An RSI of 23.26 indicates the stock is heavily oversold, which could signal a potential for a short-term rebound.
*   **PPO:**  A negative PPO reinforces the downward price trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Despite the overall negative sentiment, the signal recommends buying, allocating 100% of available cash. However, this appears tied to the high MRI rating, which might be questionable.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** The slight increase in the relative divergence suggests a possible short-term improvement compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** A 0.0% expected return indicates that, *based on the model*, there's no anticipated excess return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Based on the provided data, Teladoc Health (TDOC) faces significant challenges.

*   **Poor Performance:** The stock has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence.
*   **Negative Profitability:** TDOC consistently reports negative EPS and ROE, indicating it is not profitable despite stable revenue and healthy profit margins.
*   **Volatile Price Action:** The stock exhibits high volatility, as evidenced by the MDD in the alpha/beta analysis and inclusion in "volatile stocks" lists.
*   **Contradictory Indicators:** The MRI suggests a relatively low-risk investment, which is at odds with the negative financial performance, analyst sentiment, and news headlines. This raises concerns about the validity and applicability of the MRI in this specific case.
*   **News Sentiment:** Recent news is mixed, with some articles highlighting better alternatives and expressing concerns about Teladoc's future.
*   **Oversold Conditions:** The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, which *could* lead to a short-term rebound, but this is not guaranteed.

**Conclusion:**

TDOC presents a high-risk investment. While oversold conditions *may* lead to a temporary price increase, the company's fundamental challenges (lack of profitability, underperformance relative to benchmarks) and negative news sentiment warrant caution. The contradictory MRI should be investigated further before relying on it for investment decisions. The Hybrid Signal suggesting a buy should be viewed with extreme skepticism given the totality of the other negative factors. A thorough evaluation of Teladoc's long-term business strategy and path to profitability is essential before considering an investment.
