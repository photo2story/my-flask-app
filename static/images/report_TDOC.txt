    | 2019-2021  | -78.0%  | 80.9% | -125.0% | 0.3    | 16.3   |
    | 2020-2022  | -252.0% | 85.9% | -251.0% | -0.9   | 4.2    |

    | 2022-2024  | -93.0%  | 85.9% | -113.0% | -1.9   | 1.6    |
    | 2023-2025  | -36.0%  | 81.6% | -99.0%  | -0.8   | 1.3    |

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows strong growth in earlier periods, followed by significant declines in recent years.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Indicates the maximum loss from peak to trough during the period, consistently high suggesting high volatility.
    *   **Alpha:** Measures the excess return relative to a benchmark. Negative alpha in recent periods indicates TDOC has underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500), showing a consistent negative trend.
    *   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. The beta has become increasingly negative, suggesting an inverse correlation with the market in recent years (it moves opposite to the market), potentially reflecting company-specific issues.
    *   **Cap(B):** Shows the market capitalization in billions, which has decreased significantly over time, reflecting the decline in stock value.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $7.14
*   **Last-market change:** Price decreased by -1.52% compared to the previous close.
*   **Moving Averages:** The stock price is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), indicating a downtrend.
*   **SMA Trend:** 5-day SMA < 20-day SMA < 60-day SMA suggesting a persistent downtrend.

**3. Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 suggests "Medium Investment" risk, but this should be viewed cautiously given the other negative indicators.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 33.21 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), which *could* suggest a potential for a short-term bounce. However, in a strong downtrend, oversold conditions can persist for extended periods.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.1144 Indicates a bearish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" signal seems overly optimistic given the overall negative outlook. The signal is generated by a specific system and might not be appropriate in this context. *Pay close attention to the conditions under which this "safe" signal is generated; it's likely flawed.* The mention of monthly investment is a reminder that dollar-cost averaging can be used, but it doesn't change the fundamental risks of the stock.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** "단기하락" (Short-term decline) is consistent with the price action.
*   **Expected Return:** -10274.4% This extremely negative expected return is a major red flag and suggests the model predicting this expects the company to go bankrupt or experience massive further decline.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Assessing Valuation After Recent Short-Term Share Price Rebound:** Suggests a short-term positive movement, but the overall valuation is still being questioned.
*   **Receives Consensus Rating of "Hold" from Brokerages:** Indicates a neutral stance from analysts, suggesting a lack of strong conviction either way.
*   **Responsive Playbooks and the TDOC Inflection:** Implies potential strategic changes or a turning point for the company, but the content needs further review to assess its impact.
*   **Reassessing Valuation After New $13.6 Million ESOP Shelf Registration Filing:** ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan) filings can dilute existing shareholders if new shares are issued.
*   **Teladoc Health president Bliss sells $34,310 in stock & Insider Sale: President of BetterHelp of $TDOC Sells 4,209 Shares:** Insider selling is generally a negative signal, as it may indicate a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold, with a mean rating of 2.67.
*   **Target Price:** Average target price of $9.18, which is higher than the current price, but the low target of $7.00 suggests some analysts are very bearish.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No recent rating changes indicated, which suggests that analysts have been relatively stable in their outlook.

**6. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $0.63B     | 70.12%         |
| 2025-06-30   | $0.63B     | 69.85%         |

| 2024-09-30   | $0.64B     | 71.94%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE      |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $1.39B     | -3.56%   |
| 2025-06-30   | $1.42B     | -2.30%   |
| 2025-03-31   | $1.43B     | -6.52%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $1.49B     | -3.25%   |
| 2024-09-30   | $1.51B     | -2.21%   |

*   **Revenue:** As noted above, revenue is stable but not growing.
*   **Profit Margin:** While the profit margin *appears* high, this is likely a gross profit margin. The net profit margin (after all expenses) is negative, as evidenced by the negative EPS. Therefore, this reported profit margin is misleading.
*   **Equity:** Equity is decreasing, indicating that the company is losing assets.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** Consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating profits from shareholder equity.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) is facing significant challenges. The stock has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500, and recent performance indicators are largely negative. While revenue is stable, the company is not profitable, and its equity is declining. Insider selling adds to the concerns.

*   **Major Concerns:**
    *   **Lack of Profitability:** Consistently negative EPS and ROE.
    *   **Negative Alpha and High Maximum Drawdown:** Indicating underperformance and high risk.
    *   **Downtrend:** The stock is in a clear downtrend, trading below its moving averages.
    *   **Decreasing Equity:** Eroding balance sheet.
    *   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** A strong indication of serious problems.
    *   **Profit Margin Misinterpretation:** The presented high profit margin is probably gross profit, with significant operating losses not shown.

*   **Potential Positives (But Weak):**
    *   **Oversold RSI:** *Potentially* a short-term bounce, but not a reliable indicator in a strong downtrend.
    *   **Analyst Consensus Hold:** Suggests some analysts see potential for improvement, but the low target price reveals underlying skepticism.

*   **Conclusion:**

Based on the comprehensive analysis, **TDOC appears to be a high-risk investment.** The company faces significant challenges in achieving profitability and demonstrating sustained growth. The negative trend in financial metrics, combined with insider selling and a deeply negative expected return, warrant extreme caution. The "Hybrid Signal" suggesting a buy should be viewed with significant skepticism, as it appears to be an outlier given the totality of negative indicators. A "Hold" recommendation should be taken with a grain of salt considering how many negative factors affect the stock.
