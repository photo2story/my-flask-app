**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR and MDD:** The historical CAGR shows periods of significant growth followed by substantial declines, highlighting the stock's volatile nature. High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures indicate considerable risk.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha values in recent years suggest underperformance relative to its benchmark, indicating the company is not generating excess returns.
*   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuating around 0 indicate that the stock price has very little correlation to the broader market.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has decreased drastically, suggesting the company's size and investor confidence have diminished.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** \$8.20
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: \$8.20, Previous Close: \$8.20, Change: \$0.0
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** \$8.35
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** \$8.34
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** \$7.57

**Analysis:** The stock price is relatively stable around \$8.20. The 5-day and 20-day moving averages are very close, hovering just above the current price, suggesting a slight downward pressure in the short term. However, the 60-day moving average is significantly lower, potentially indicating a longer-term upward trend that might be losing momentum.  The "change" being 0.0 signifies no movement in the last trading session compared to the previous close.

**3. Indicators and Signals**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 52.30
*   **PPO:** -0.54
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_69%_Sell 1.0% of holdings (16 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) - Short-term decline
*   **Expected Return (%):** -9736.8%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The low MRI suggests that the overall market risk is considered low at the moment, but it doesn't necessarily translate to lower risk for TDOC itself.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 52.30 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-0.54) indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, suggesting a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends a cautious approach, advising to slightly reduce holdings and increase cash position. The high cash ratio (69%) suggests a defensive strategy.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** No change, it shows no current short term decline
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return of -9736.8% is unrealistic and likely an outlier. It suggests very poor future performance compared to the S&P 500.  This should be investigated for calculation errors.

The dramatic ROE drop in 2024-06-30 corresponds to the big loss reported in the Earnings Analysis.
