*   **60-day Moving Average:** \$8.68

**Analysis:**

The current price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, which could be a short-term bullish signal. However, the 60-day moving average is significantly higher, suggesting a longer-term downtrend.
The small `change` may not have a significant impact unless further volatility follows.

*   **RSI:** An RSI of 54.98 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.8315 suggests the price is slightly above its moving average.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change (-0.2) indicates a short-term downtrend relative to the comparison index.

This suggests that, based on the model, a long-term investment in TDOC is expected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.  This should be heavily scrutinized and understood in the context of the model's assumptions.

| 2024-06-30   | \$0.64B   | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31   | \$0.65B   | 69.89%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE      |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| 2025-03-31   | \$1.43B   | -6.52%   |
| 2024-12-31   | \$1.49B   | -3.25%   |

| 2024-03-31   | \$2.29B   | -3.58%   |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** Revenue has remained relatively consistent over the past five quarters.
*   **Profit Margin:** The profit margins are quite high, consistently around 70%, which is positive. However, it's important to understand what costs are included in this calculation.
*   **Equity:** Equity has been decreasing, indicating potential financial strain.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) is negative in all quarters, reflecting the company's inability to generate profits from its equity.  The extremely negative ROE in 2024-06-30 aligns with the significant EPS loss in the same period and is a major red flag.

### 7. 종합 결론

**Summary:**

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) is facing significant challenges. The company has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. Recent performance metrics (CAGR, Alpha) are poor. While revenue has been stable, persistent losses (negative EPS and ROE) are concerning. Although high profit margins suggest efficiency in some areas, the negative ROE indicates overall unprofitability. The extremely negative expected return indicates a significant risk of underperformance relative to the broader market. Recent news suggests volatility and ongoing scrutiny.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a highly cautious approach to TDOC is warranted. Investors should carefully consider the risks, monitor news and earnings reports, and thoroughly understand the company's plans to address its profitability issues before considering an investment. The negative expected return, in particular, is a major red flag.
