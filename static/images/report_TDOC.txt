**Company Overview:** Teladoc Health Inc. provides telehealth services, connecting patients with healthcare providers through virtual consultations.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $10.34
* **5-day Moving Average:** $10.30
* **20-day Moving Average:** $9.77
* **60-day Moving Average:** $9.93

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some recent upward momentum, but still below the 60-day average indicating a longer-term downtrend.  The recent price change shows a minor decrease (-$0.0966) from the previous close, not significantly impacting the overall picture.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 60.85. This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, residing in a neutral territory.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.19. A positive PPO value indicates that the price is above its moving average, consistent with the slightly positive short-term trend shown by the moving averages.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +0.2 This suggests short-term upward momentum.

* **Expected Return:** -7125.0%. This extremely negative figure strongly suggests a significantly negative outlook for TDOC's future performance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming a continued current trend.  This drastic negative return requires further investigation as it might indicate an error in the data or an outlier prediction.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows consistent negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) across all reported quarters. Revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64 - $0.66 Billion, but the consistent losses are concerning.  The significant drop in EPS between Q2 2024 and Q1 2024 warrants further investigation to understand the cause.


| Date        | EPS   | Revenue      |
|-------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31  | -0.19 | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-08-01  | -4.92 | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-04-26  | -0.49 | $0.65 B      |

| 2024-10-31  | -0.35 | $0.66 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows consistent revenue but significantly fluctuating and generally negative profitability.  The profit margin is relatively high (70-72%) which is surprising given the negative EPS values.  This discrepancy needs clarification, potentially concerning accounting practices or non-GAAP reporting.  The Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity investments.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $0.64B     | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.64B     | 70.73%        |

| 2023-09-30  | $0.66B     | 71.83%        |

| 2024-09-30  | $1.51B     | -2.21%       |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance is deeply concerning.  The stock has severely underperformed the S&P 500, showing consistent negative returns. While revenue is relatively stable, the company is consistently unprofitable with negative EPS and ROE. The extremely negative predicted long-term return against the S&P 500 (-7125%) is a critical red flag and needs further investigation to determine the validity of this projection. The high profit margins reported despite significant losses require clarification.  Further investigation into the company's strategy, competitive landscape, and potential future catalysts is required before any investment decisions are made.  The current data strongly suggests a high-risk investment.

**8. Disclaimer:** This analysis is based on the limited data provided.  It should not be considered financial advice.  Conduct thorough due diligence and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.  The significantly negative expected return should be critically examined as it may be an outlier.
