### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** $7.62
*   **Previous Close:** $7.35
*   **Change:** 3.67%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 7.204
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 7.0745
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 8.3787

**Analysis:**

The current price shows a positive change compared to the previous close. The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, potentially indicating a short-term upward trend. However, it's still below the 60-day moving average, suggesting that the longer-term trend might still be downward or consolidating. The significant positive change from the previous close could indicate a short-term rebound.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3485 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 62.67 (Slightly overbought, but not extreme)
*   **PPO:** 1.59
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -0.8 (Short-term decrease in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return:** -3867.1%

**Analysis:**

*   The Market Risk Indicator suggests a low-risk environment, which is counterintuitive given the poor performance. This may be a short-term risk assessment that does not reflect the longer-term issues.
*   The RSI is nearing overbought territory, which could signal a potential pullback.
*   The negative change in relative divergence suggests that TDOC's underperformance compared to the S&P 500 has worsened recently.
*   The extraordinarily negative expected return is a major red flag. This suggests that, based on current trends, an investment in TDOC is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term.
*   The significant price change (3.67%) from the last market indicates possible volatility and market reaction to recent news or events.

*   **Capital and Profitability:** Declining equity and negative ROE values are significant concerns. The sharp drop in ROE in 2024-06-30 is particularly alarming.

### 7. 종합 Analysis

The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the expected return is extremely negative. Recent news points to ongoing volatility and market scrutiny. The declining equity and negative ROE values suggest potential financial instability.  While the MRI indicates low market risk, this appears to contradict the other data points, which paint a concerning picture. 투자에 주의하십시오.
