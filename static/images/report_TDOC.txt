2025-01-30 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) based on the provided data, presented in a report format.

**Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) Investment Report**

**1. Performance Summary & Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO)**

Teladoc Health Inc. is a telehealth company providing virtual care services.  As of the last day of the provided data, TDOC's cumulative return is -63.41%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 119.89%. The difference in cumulative returns is a stark -183.3%, placing it at the 6th percentile (0.6) of the historical range of relative performance against the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures demonstrate periods of significant growth followed by substantial declines.  The consistently low or zero Alpha suggests TDOC's returns aren't significantly outperforming the market, adjusted for risk (Beta). High Beta values (particularly in 2017-2020) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements. The recent periods show extremely negative CAGRs and a drastic reduction in Beta, reflecting a significant drop in market capitalization (Cap(B)).


**2. Recent Price Movement**

* **Closing Price:** $10.35
* **5-day Moving Average:** $10.26
* **20-day Moving Average:** $9.72
* **60-day Moving Average:** $9.91

The price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, it is slightly below its 60-day moving average, hinting at some uncertainty regarding the longer-term direction.  The recent price change of -$1.62 shows a small negative movement in the latest trading session.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 56.47 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in a neutral territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 1.28 – Positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, aligning with the short-term upward trend observed in the moving averages.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +0.4 (Positive) – Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** -7064.0% – This extremely negative expected return over the long term (2+ years) highlights significant concerns about TDOC's future performance relative to the S&P 500.  This figure needs further clarification regarding its calculation method.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis**

The earnings data reveals consistent losses (negative EPS) over the reported quarters. While revenue has remained relatively stable around $0.64-$0.66 billion, the company is not profitable. The significant drop in EPS from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024 (-4.92 vs -0.19) warrants further investigation.  There is a discrepancy in the reported Q3 2024 data with two entries; one needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information Analysis**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively consistent, yet profit margins, while high, are based on negative earnings. This suggests significant issues with cost control.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  The significant fluctuations and negative Return on Equity (ROE) across the quarters strongly indicate considerable financial distress. The significant drop in equity from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024 warrants further investigation.


**7. Overall Analysis**

Teladoc Health is currently experiencing significant challenges. While it operates in a growing sector, its consistent losses, negative ROE, and substantially underperforming market returns paint a concerning picture.  The high Beta in the past shows extreme volatility, and the recent low Beta reflects a significant loss of market capitalization.  Technical indicators suggest a short-term upward trend, but the overall financial picture and extremely negative long-term expected return raise significant concerns regarding long-term investment viability.  The large discrepancy between the short-term indicators and long-term expectations warrants a deeper fundamental analysis to assess the long-term viability of the business model and address the reported inconsistencies in earnings. Further investigation into the causes of the substantial EPS drop and the fluctuating Equity is crucial before any investment decision.

**8. Recommendations**

Given the substantial underperformance, consistent losses, negative ROE, and the drastically negative long-term expected return, further due diligence is strongly recommended before considering any investment in TDOC.  A thorough analysis of the company's strategic plans to achieve profitability, coupled with a more in-depth understanding of the -7064% expected return calculation, is essential.  Considering the current financial condition, investors should proceed with extreme caution.
