* **TDOC Cumulative Return:** -71.06%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 71.62%
* **Return Difference:** -142.68%  (This is the difference in cumulative returns between TDOC and VOO at the end of the period.)

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

TDOC's performance has been significantly poor compared to the S&P 500, exhibiting substantial negative returns and high volatility.  While some periods show impressive growth, the recent trend is overwhelmingly negative, as reflected in the negative EPS, negative ROE, and low price relative to moving averages.  The extremely negative expected return further emphasizes the significant risk involved.  Before considering any investment, a thorough investigation into the reasons for the significant negative EPS in August 2024 and the low ROE are crucial.  The current indicators suggest a bearish outlook, and the extremely high negative expected return casts serious doubt on long-term profitability relative to the market.  Further analysis of the company's strategy and competitive landscape is needed before forming any investment decision.  The high negative expected return should be scrutinized to understand its basis and methodology.
