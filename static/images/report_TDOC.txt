*   **Alpha:** The alpha is largely negative in recent years, suggesting that the stock has underperformed relative to its risk (beta).
*   **Beta:** Beta values have fluctuated. A negative beta indicates that the stock price tends to move in the opposite direction of the market. In the most recent years, the beta is negative, suggesting the stock price has been moving in the opposite direction of the market.

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 7.9042
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 7.7717

**Analysis:** The stock price has decreased by -4.33% in the last market. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day moving average, which is above the 60-day moving average.

*   **RSI:** 50.74
*   **PPO:** -0.0038

*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.4 (+) - Short-term Increase
*   **Expected Return (%):** -7151.4% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** While the MRI suggests "High Investment Recommended," this seems contradictory given the other negative indicators and requires careful consideration of the methodology behind the MRI.
*   **RSI:** An RSI around 50 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:**  A PPO near zero suggests that the short-term moving average is nearly equal to the long-term moving average, indicating no strong trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  The hybrid signal suggests buying, however, due to contradictory MRI, it must be considered carefully.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:**  The recent increase in relative divergence indicates a short-term improvement relative to the S&P 500, but this is occurring in the context of significant long-term underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return suggests very poor long-term prospects compared to the S&P 500, requiring serious scrutiny.
*   **Last Market Change:** The negative change indicates downward pressure on the stock.

**7. Overall Assessment**

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) presents a mixed picture.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, investing in TDOC appears risky. While there are some potentially positive signs, such as stable revenue and high-profit margins, the consistent losses, underperformance compared to the market, and negative expected return raise significant concerns. The recent stock price surge mentioned in the news headlines should be viewed cautiously as it might be a short-term fluctuation or driven by broader market trends.

A more in-depth analysis, including a review of the company's long-term strategy, competitive landscape, and the specific reasons for the losses, would be necessary before making an investment decision. The impact of the Medicare telehealth policy deadline also needs to be carefully evaluated.
