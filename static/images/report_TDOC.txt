**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE      |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B | -3.25%   |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is exhibiting severe underperformance against the market, with significant negative returns and high volatility.  While revenue remains relatively stable, the company is facing serious profitability issues reflected in consistent negative EPS and ROE.  The high risk indicated by various technical indicators and the extremely negative expected return suggest that, based on this data alone, investment in TDOC is extremely risky.  Further investigation into the causes of the significant losses and the long-term viability of the company's business model is crucial before considering any investment.  The data suggests a high probability of further losses.
