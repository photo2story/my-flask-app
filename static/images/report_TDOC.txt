This report analyzes Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC), a telehealth company providing virtual care services.  We will examine its performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key indicators, earnings, financial information, and provide a final conclusion.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

TDOC's cumulative return is -67.46%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's 116.38% return. The difference is a staggering -183.8%, placing it at the 5th percentile (relative divergence of 0.5) compared to its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (max: 710.6, min: -188.5).  The provided CAGR data shows periods of substantial growth followed by significant declines, especially in recent years.  The consistently high Beta (around 2.0) indicates high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.20
* **Last Market Price:** $9.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $9.497
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $9.4963
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.7656

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The small difference between the closing and last market price indicates limited recent price volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.93 -  Near the neutral level (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** -0.21 - Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 - Shows a recent short-term downturn.
* **Expected Return:** -6752.0% - This extremely negative figure suggests a significant projected loss.  This is likely an error in the provided data. The expected return should be recalculated using appropriate methodology, considering the extreme negativity is nonsensical given typical investment scenarios.
* **9.18 impact:** With 9.18 being slightly below the recent moving averages, there is no indication of a dramatic price swing (sharp upward or downward movement).

The duplicate entry for October 31, 2024 needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B  | 70.73%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B  | -55.77%   |

| 2023-09-30 | $2.29B  | -2.49%    |

Despite relatively stable revenue, the consistently high profit margin is offset by negative ROE, indicating that the company is not generating a return on its equity.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind this discrepancy.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance has been significantly poor, substantially underperforming the S&P 500. While revenue remains relatively stable, consistently negative EPS and ROE raise major concerns about the company's long-term viability and profitability.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, and the extremely negative expected return (likely an error in provided data) points to considerable risk.  Before considering any investment, thorough due diligence and clarification on the inconsistencies in the provided data are crucial.  The high beta indicates significant volatility; therefore, any investment strategy needs to consider that risk.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the substantial underperformance, consistently negative earnings, and questionable projected return, a long-term investment in TDOC at this time carries significant risk.  Further investigation into the reasons for negative ROE despite high profit margins, clarification on data inconsistencies (especially the extreme negative expected return and duplicate earnings data), and a reassessment of the company's long-term business strategy are strongly recommended before any investment decision is made.  Considering the inherent volatility indicated by its high Beta, a cautious approach is strongly advised.  Potential investors should conduct their own thorough due diligence and seek professional financial advice.
