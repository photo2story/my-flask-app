**Company Overview:** Teladoc Health Inc. provides virtual healthcare services.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided CAGR figures show extremely high growth in the early years (2015-2020), followed by substantial negative returns in recent years. The consistently near-zero alpha suggests the stock's performance is largely explained by market movements (high Beta), however, the beta is highly volatile.  The significant decline in market capitalization from 2020 onwards highlights the sharp downturn in investor sentiment.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $9.84
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.75

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (0.4):** Shows recent short-term upward movement relative to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (-6442.4%):** This extremely negative expected return is likely a miscalculation or reflects an extremely pessimistic outlook based on the severe past underperformance.  A more realistic assessment would be needed to determine a likely future performance, especially in a long-term (2+ year) time horizon.   The extremely low current price and negative expected return suggest extremely high risk involved in investment.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook information is provided.  Analyst opinions are unavailable in the provided data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC has experienced a dramatic decline in performance, severely underperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action shows some short-term upward movement and the RSI approaches oversold territory,  the consistently negative EPS, deteriorating ROE, and overall trend of negative returns paint a concerning picture. The exceptionally negative expected return provided is likely erroneous.  The high risk involved in investing in TDOC is significant,  given the company's performance and financial indicators.  Further investigation of market outlook, analyst opinions, and a detailed examination of the "expected return" calculation would be necessary before considering an investment.
