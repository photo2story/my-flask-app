The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods, exhibiting high volatility and negative returns recently.

The data reveals periods of extremely high growth followed by substantial declines.  The negative alpha in recent years indicates underperformance compared to a benchmark adjusted for market risk.  The fluctuating beta suggests varying sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.04
* **Previous Close:** $13.86
* **5-day Moving Average:** $12.56
* **20-day Moving Average:** $10.57
* **60-day Moving Average:** $10.24

The stock price is currently above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend, despite a recent decline.  However, the relatively large gap between the current price and the longer-term averages signals some uncertainty.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 77.05 – Suggests the stock is in overbought territory, indicating a potential near-term pullback.
* **PPO:** 3.39 –  A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.9 (+) – Indicates short-term upward momentum.

The price change of -5.92% from the previous close reflects recent negative movement, despite positive momentum signals in other indicators. This discrepancy warrants close monitoring. The expected return of -4290.5% is exceptionally negative and likely unrealistic for a long-term investment horizon.  This extremely low figure might be a result of errors in the calculation or assumptions made.  A more sophisticated model is needed for a realistic long-term expectation relative to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue      |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19   | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92   | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49   | $0.65 B      |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35   | $0.66 B      |
| 2023-10-31 | -$0.35   | $0.66 B      | (Duplicate entry, likely a data error)


Consistent negative EPS is a significant concern.  Revenue remains relatively stable, but the lack of profitability is alarming. The large negative EPS in August 2024 requires further investigation to understand the underlying cause.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.66B | 71.83%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity  | ROE        |
|---------|---------|------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77%    |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58%     |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24%     |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.29B | -2.49%     |

High profit margins are offset by negative ROE, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity. The significant drop in ROE in Q2 2024 requires a detailed examination.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance has been highly volatile, characterized by periods of strong growth followed by significant declines. While revenue remains relatively stable, the consistently negative EPS and fluctuating negative ROE are major red flags.  The stock's current valuation appears high relative to its recent performance and uncertain future profitability.  The overbought RSI suggests a potential short-term correction.  Before considering a long-term investment, further investigation into the reasons behind the substantial Q2 2024 loss and the overall lack of consistent profitability is crucial.  A realistic long-term outlook needs a more robust financial model than the -4290.5% prediction provided.  The extremely high risk associated with TDOC should be carefully weighed against the potential for future growth.
