| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35 | $0.66B        |

The company has consistently reported negative EPS over the provided period. Revenue is relatively stable but earnings are severely depressed, signaling potential operational challenges. The August 2024 EPS figure (-$4.92) is exceptionally negative and requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B | 70.50%      |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94%      |

| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89%      |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72%      |

Revenue has remained relatively consistent, while profit margins are generally high despite negative EPS.  The discrepancy requires further investigation into the accounting practices.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE     |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B | -3.25%  |

| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77% |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24%  |

Equity has decreased over the last two quarters, and ROE is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating returns on its equity.  The extremely negative ROE in Q2 2024 (-55.77%) demands further scrutiny.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is currently experiencing significant challenges.  While revenue remains relatively stable, the consistently negative EPS and ROE, coupled with the substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, paint a concerning picture.  The exceptionally negative EPS in August 2024 necessitates thorough investigation.  The high profit margins reported alongside negative earnings require examination of the accounting methods employed.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, and the PPO shows some positive momentum, the fundamental weaknesses significantly outweigh any short-term technical signals.  A long-term investment requires careful consideration of the company's ability to address its operational and financial issues. The -2578.3% expected return is likely erroneous and requires correction.  Before investing, a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial statements and future prospects is crucial.
