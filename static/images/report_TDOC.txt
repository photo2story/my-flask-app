*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows strong growth in the early periods, but significant decline in recent periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Relatively high MDD figures indicate substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Positive alpha in earlier periods suggests outperformance relative to a benchmark.  However, the negative alpha in recent periods strongly suggests underperformance.
*   **Beta:** The beta value has fluctuated, turning negative in recent years, indicating that the stock's price movements are, more recently, less correlated (and often inversely correlated) with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization decreased significantly since 2018-2020 period.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 7.0

*   **20-day SMA:** 7.3703
*   **60-day SMA:** 7.8012

**Analysis:** The stock price (7.0) is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA's - 5, 20, and 60 day).  This suggests a downtrend. The positive change from the previous close could indicate a short-term rebound, but the longer-term trends suggest continued downward pressure.

**3) Analysis of Indicators**

*   **RSI:** 23.07 (Oversold)

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.4 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10459.9

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI suggests the system believes TDOC is a good investment despite its recent performance.  This could be based on factors not immediately apparent in the data or a belief in a future turnaround. This high MRI needs to be interpreted with extreme caution, given all the other negative signals.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 23.07 indicates that the stock is oversold, potentially suggesting a possible rebound in the short term.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO value suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  This signal is aggressively bullish, recommending full investment, despite the numerous bearish indicators.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence corroborates the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The massively negative expected return is extremely concerning and suggests the algorithm anticipates further significant losses.

| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21% |

*   **Revenue and Profit Margin:** Revenue has been relatively stable, while profit margins are seemingly very high. But are these gross profit margins? If so, this should be investigated.
*   **Equity and ROE:** Equity is declining, which is a negative sign, and the negative Return on Equity (ROE) figures confirm the company is not generating profits from its equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Teladoc (TDOC) presents a mixed and concerning picture.

*   **Negative Performance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 with a large negative divergence.
*   **Downtrend:**  Technical indicators (SMA's, PPO) point to a downtrend.
*   **Concerning Financials:** Consistent losses (negative EPS and ROE), declining equity, and potentially inflated profit margins are major red flags.
*   **Negative News Flow:** Recent news headlines are predominantly negative, including institutional selling and comparisons to competitors.
*   **Mixed Signals:**  The oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term bounce, and analysts have a slightly higher target price, but the strongly negative expected return and negative news dominate. The high MRI is an outlier and should be viewed with extreme skepticism.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** While the hybrid signal suggests buying, this recommendation contradicts much of the other data.

**Overall Conclusion:** Based on this data, an investment in Teladoc is *highly risky*. While there might be a short-term rebound, the long-term outlook appears challenging. The significant underperformance, negative financials, and negative news flow outweigh any potential positive signals. Further, the provided hybrid signal seems to contradict all the other data, and is not reliable. More research would be needed to fully understand the high MRI and the basis of the hybrid buy recommendation, but based on this report, a cautious approach is strongly advised.
