The absence of Total Revenue and Gross Profit data significantly limits a complete financial analysis.  This data is crucial for evaluating profitability and overall financial health.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance has drastically deteriorated in recent years, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price movements show a short-term upward trend, technical indicators suggest an overbought condition. The consistently negative EPS and the lack of key financial data raise serious concerns about the company's long-term prospects. The extremely negative expected return (-3686.5%) highlights the significant risk associated with investing in TDOC, especially when compared to the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative earnings and missing financial data is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The current short-term upward trend should be viewed with caution given the overall negative picture.
