## Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:**

Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) is a telehealth company providing virtual healthcare services.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over recent years, exhibiting high volatility and negative returns. While recent financial data shows relatively stable revenue, profitability remains a concern.  Further analysis is needed to determine future investment potential.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Teladoc Health (TDOC) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return of TDOC is -71.06%, while VOO shows a cumulative return of 71.61%.  This represents a divergence of -142.7%, placing it at the 4.7th percentile of its historical range (-171.5% to 447.1%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a high beta (generally above 6) in the earlier years, indicating significant market sensitivity and potentially high risk.  More recently, the beta has decreased, but the Alpha consistently shows negative values since 2019, implying underperformance relative to the market.  The substantial negative CAGR values across recent years further emphasize the stock's poor performance.  The consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD)  highlights the significant risk associated with TDOC investment.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is $6.83.  The stock experienced a recent decrease of -1.01% from the previous close.  The moving averages indicate a downtrend:

* 5-day MA: $7.07
* 20-day MA: $7.72
* 60-day MA: $9.63


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI (27.34) is below 30, suggesting the stock may be oversold.  However, the negative PPO (-0.198) indicates bearish momentum. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.4223 falls within the medium-risk range.  The recent relative divergence (+0.1) shows a short-term upward trend.  The provided expected return of -1849.8% is extremely negative and likely unrealistic; a more detailed model would be required to arrive at a plausible long-term expectation compared to the S&P 500. The significant price drop of -1.01% suggests potential negative investor sentiment and market pressure.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings show consistent negative EPS and relatively stable revenue, indicating a concerning lack of profitability. Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative EPS is needed.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19  | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-08-01 | -4.92  | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-04-26 | -0.49  | $0.65 B      |
| 2023-10-27 | -0.35  | $0.66 B      |
| 2024-10-31 | -0.35  | $0.66 B      |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, but the profit margin, while high in percentage terms, is somewhat misleading given the significant negative EPS values.  The equity has fluctuated but shows a considerable drop in Q1 2024.  ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity investments.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B | 70.50% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE      |
|---------|---------|----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B | -3.25%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24%   |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

TDOC has experienced a severe downturn, significantly underperforming the market. While revenue remains relatively stable, consistent negative EPS and ROE raise serious concerns about the company's profitability and long-term viability.  The high volatility and negative alpha suggest substantial risk.  The oversold RSI might indicate a potential short-term bounce, but the negative PPO and overall financial picture suggest caution.  Any investment decision should be made after careful consideration of these factors and thorough due diligence, including a comprehensive analysis of the company's strategy and future prospects.  The -1849.8% expected return is likely erroneous and needs re-evaluation with a more robust model.  Long-term investment in TDOC requires a high risk tolerance given its historical performance and current financial position.
