The data shows a dramatic shift from high positive CAGR and Alpha to significantly negative values in recent years, indicating considerable underperformance relative to the market.  The high Beta in earlier years suggests high volatility, and the increasingly negative Alpha in later years points to consistent underperformance against the market benchmark.

* **Closing Price:** $7.76
* **Last Market Price:** $7.82 (0.77% increase from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $8.20
* **20-day Moving Average:** $8.61
* **60-day Moving Average:** $10.09

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent slight increase might be a temporary bounce.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Low Risk)
* **RSI:** 33.43 (Below 30, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.23 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** +0.4 (Short-term upward trend)

The recent price increase (`{'price': 7.82, 'previousClose': 7.76, 'change': 0.77}`) is a relatively small movement and does not indicate a significant bounce or reversal.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19 | $0.64B       |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92 | $0.64B       |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49 | $0.65B       |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35 | $0.66B       |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35 | $0.66B       |


Consistent negative EPS across the reported quarters indicates ongoing financial losses. Revenue remains relatively stable, but the lack of profitability is a major concern. The August 2024 EPS is particularly alarming.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B | 70.50% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B | -3.25% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77% |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58% |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24% |

High profit margins are reported, but negative ROE indicates that the company is not generating returns on its equity.  The drastic drop in ROE in Q2 2024 is highly concerning.  There's a significant discrepancy between reported profit margin and the negative ROE, requiring further investigation to understand the accounting practices.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance has been extremely poor compared to the S&P 500.  While the company has shown periods of significant growth, recent results are overwhelmingly negative, with consistently negative EPS and a severely negative ROE.  The high negative expected return (-4135.3%) is highly dubious and needs clarification.  The low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish sentiment, while the MRI indicates low market risk.  The current price is below key moving averages.  Before considering any long-term investment, a thorough investigation into the reasons behind the substantial losses and the discrepancies in the financial data is crucial.  The negative Alpha consistently highlights underperformance relative to the market.  Long-term investment, even with a low market risk, seems highly speculative at this juncture.  Further due diligence and a comprehensive understanding of the company's future strategy are necessary before making any investment decisions.
