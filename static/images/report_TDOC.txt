**6) Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance has been significantly poor relative to the S&P 500, with consistent negative EPS and fluctuating profitability despite relatively stable revenue.  The negative ROE raises serious concerns about the company's ability to generate returns.  While some technical indicators suggest potential for a rebound, the fundamental financial picture is weak.  The extremely high negative expected return figure should be disregarded as unreliable without further context.  Long-term investment requires a thorough understanding of the reasons for the company's underperformance and a strong belief in its future turnaround strategy.  Significant risk is involved.  Further due diligence, including reviewing management commentary and industry analysis, is highly recommended before considering any investment in TDOC.
