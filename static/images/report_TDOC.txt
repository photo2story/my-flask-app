**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings reports reveal a consistent pattern of negative EPS and relatively flat revenue.  There's no clear revenue growth trend; it remains relatively stable around $0.64-$0.66B.  EPS shows significant losses consistently throughout the reported periods, with a notably larger loss in August 2024 (-$4.92).  Without expectations data, it's impossible to determine if these results beat or missed targets.  Profitability, as indicated by the consistently negative EPS, is a major concern.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, but profit margins fluctuate slightly. The company is showing a high profit margin but this is misleading given that the EPS is overwhelmingly negative.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has fluctuated, and ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity investment. This is a significant red flag.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**  No specific news or analyst opinions within the last two days regarding earnings were provided.  The lack of this information limits a comprehensive assessment.  A broader market outlook and any analyst ratings would also be helpful in evaluating the stock.


**7.  Comprehensive Analysis:**

TDOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, showing a large negative cumulative return.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but negative EPS and ROE raise serious concerns about the company's financial health.  While the revenue remains relatively stable, the lack of profitability is a critical factor.  Additional information, including recent news, analyst opinions, and a complete understanding of market expectations for earnings, is necessary for a complete evaluation.  The current data strongly suggests a high-risk investment with significant downside potential.  The projected 0% return over the long-term reflects this assessment; however, a recovery is not impossible.
