| 2019-2021 | -78.0%  | 80.9% | -125.0% | 0.3    | 16.3   |
| 2020-2022 | -252.0% | 85.9% | -251.0% | -0.9   | 4.2    |

| 2023-2025 | -36.0%  | 81.6% | -103.0% | -0.8   | 1.3    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Shows a dramatic decline in annual growth rates, moving from very high positive numbers to significantly negative.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Indicates consistently high risk (drawdown) over all periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures performance relative to a benchmark.  The consistently negative alpha in recent periods indicates TDOC is significantly underperforming its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) *even when adjusted for market risk*.
*   **Beta:** Beta is interesting. The beta has fluctuated, it's most recently moved into negative territory.  A negative beta suggests the stock moves *inversely* to the market.  A beta near zero suggests the stock is independent of the market. Given the underperformance, the negative beta suggests TDOC might be considered more of a contrarian investment, and is less susceptible to market trends.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has decreased dramatically over the years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 7.12
*   **Last-market Change:** -1.79%
*   **5-day SMA:** 7.214
*   **20-day SMA:** 7.4295
*   **60-day SMA:** 7.8605

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3) Market Risk Indicator and Related Metrics:**

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 30.58
*   **PPO:** -0.21
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (132 shares) - Very Safe
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -0.3 (downward trend)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -10382.5%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** An MRI of 1.0 would normally suggest a high investment recommendation, which seems completely contradictory when compared to other information like the negative Expected Return. An MRI of 1.0 is likely a bug.
*   **RSI:** The RSI is 30.58, which is approaching the oversold territory (below 30).  This *could* indicate a potential for a bounce, but in the context of the other negative indicators, it's not a strong signal on its own.
*   **PPO:** The PPO is negative, indicating that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Despite the poor numbers, the Hybrid Signal recommends buying 100% of cash. This is because it deems it "very safe". 
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms short-term underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a HUGE red flag. It indicates that the model projects very poor future performance.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Down 98% From Its All-Time High? Is It Finally Time to Buy This Former Market Darling? (Motley Fool):**  This headline highlights the dramatic decline in the stock's value.  The "is it finally time to buy?" framing suggests a potential contrarian play, but the question mark is key.

*   **Mixed News, Leaning Negative:** While there might be occasional positive news, the overall sentiment is negative, with concerns about the stock's decline and competitor comparisons. Insider selling is a red flag.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** While some indicators (like the hybrid signal) may say "buy", the other indicators point to high risk, and significant losses.
