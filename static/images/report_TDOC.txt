* **20-Day Moving Average:** $8.14

* **RSI:** 45.31 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.1558 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +1.2 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -1638% (This extremely negative figure suggests significant downside risk over the long term relative to the S&P 500.  This needs further investigation and context. It likely reflects the current bearish sentiment and historical underperformance.)
