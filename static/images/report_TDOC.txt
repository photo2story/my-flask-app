**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Why Is Teladoc (TDOC) Stock Soaring Today (Yahoo Finance):** This is a positive news.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. Insider selling is a concern, while coverage about Oracle's increased stake and TDOC's soaring stock price presents a potentially positive outlook. The "Fading Hope" headline, however, reinforces negative sentiment.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (2.65)
*   **Opinions:** 21
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 9.21 / 12.00 / 7.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," indicating a neutral stance. The average target price of \$9.21 suggests some potential upside from the current price, but the low target price of \$7.00 indicates a possible downside risk. The lack of recent rating changes might reflect uncertainty or a wait-and-see approach among analysts.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Teladoc Health (TDOC) presents a high-risk investment opportunity. The company has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative cumulative return and substantial divergence.  The Alpha and Beta analysis confirms the underperformance. Recent financial data reveals consistent losses (negative EPS and ROE) despite stable revenue. Insider selling raises concerns. While analyst consensus is "Hold," the mixed news and deeply negative expected return warrant extreme caution. The price needs to break above its 60-day SMA and demonstrate sustained profitability to warrant considering a more positive outlook.

**In summary, based on the data provided, investing in TDOC appears very risky at this time.**
