| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B  | -3.58%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **High Profit Margins:**  Despite the overall losses reflected in the EPS data, the company reports high profit margins on its revenue.  This suggests operational efficiencies but potentially high fixed costs or other expenses offsetting the gross profit.
*   **Declining Equity:** Equity has been declining, particularly sharply between Q1 and Q2 2024. This is likely due to the net losses.
*   **Negative ROE:** Negative Return on Equity (ROE) confirms that the company is not generating profits from its equity base.

**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Summary)**

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) faces significant challenges.

*   **Poor Stock Performance:** It has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500, with a deeply negative cumulative return.
*   **Historical Growth, Current Struggles:**  While it experienced rapid growth in the past, recent years have seen sharp declines in performance, profitability, and market capitalization.
*   **Revenue vs. Profitability:** The company generates consistent revenue with high profit margins, but struggles to translate this into overall profitability due to high expenses, with negative EPS and ROE.
*   **Mixed Signals:** While recent price action shows some positive momentum and the MRI indicates a low-risk market environment, the RSI is approaching overbought, the relative spread continues to decline, and the expected return is severely negative.
*   **Watch for News:** Recent news and analyst discussions suggest the company is undergoing significant changes and facing both risks and opportunities.
*   **Declining Equity:** The consistent losses are eroding the company's equity.

**In conclusion:** TDOC is a high-risk investment. While there are potential opportunities, the company needs to address its profitability issues and reverse the trend of declining equity. Close monitoring of news, earnings reports, and financial statements is crucial.  The extremely negative expected return should be a major red flag for potential investors.
