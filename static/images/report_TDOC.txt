**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) is a telehealth company providing virtual care services.  The cumulative return of TDOC is -66.91%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.69%.  The divergence between TDOC and VOO is -179.6%, placing it at the 1% quantile (relative divergence of 1.0) of historical divergence between the two. This indicates a substantial underperformance compared to the broader market. The provided alpha values of 0.0 consistently across multiple years suggest that TDOC's returns are significantly influenced by market movements. The high beta values indicate high volatility and market sensitivity.  The extremely negative CAGR values in recent years (-733% and -296%) highlight significant losses.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $9.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $9.62
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.78

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.61 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.15 (Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum but weak)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +0.3 (Short-term upward movement, but within a broader downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -6620.0%  This extremely negative expected return highlights significant risk and the potential for further losses.  A 9.36 price is not significantly different and would not trigger a "rapid surge" or "rapid decline" classification.  The expected return is incredibly negative, indicating that based on current trends, long-term (2+ years) investment is unlikely to outperform the S&P 500, given the current scenario.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue      |
|------------|-----------|--------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19    | $0.64B       |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92    | $0.64B       |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49    | $0.65B       |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35    | $0.66B       |
| 2023-10-31 | -$0.35    | $0.66B       | *(likely a duplicate entry)*


The company consistently reports negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses. Revenue remains relatively stable, but without profitability, this is not sustainable.  The significant negative EPS in August 2024 is particularly concerning.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72% |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.66B | 71.83% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity  | ROE       |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58%    |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24%    |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.29B | -2.49%    |

While revenue remains relatively consistent, the high profit margins are misleading due to substantial negative EPS and ROE. This suggests serious issues with underlying profitability.  The significant drop in equity and negative ROE in Q2 2024 is alarming.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is currently experiencing significant financial distress.  Consistent negative EPS, negative ROE, and a drastic underperformance against the S&P 500 paint a bleak picture. While the RSI and PPO suggest some short-term bullish momentum, this is likely insignificant within the context of the larger bearish trend. The extremely negative expected return highlights substantial risk.  Unless the company can demonstrate a significant turnaround in profitability and address the underlying financial issues, the outlook remains highly negative.  Investment in TDOC at this time carries extreme risk.
