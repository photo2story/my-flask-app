## Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) Stock Performance Review

This report analyzes the performance of Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC), a provider of telehealth services, comparing its returns to the S&P 500 (VOO) and examining its financial health.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Teladoc Health's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500.

| Metric                     | TDOC        | VOO          | Difference |
|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| Cumulative Return (%)       | -69.55%      | 83.58%       | -153.13%    |
| Relative Divergence (Rank) | 3.0          | N/A          |             |


This indicates a substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.  The relative divergence of 3.0 suggests that TDOC's performance is in the lower end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500. The provided alpha and beta values show significant market sensitivity (high beta) and negative alpha, suggesting underperformance compared to the market benchmarks in several time periods,  especially recently.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The table shows fluctuating CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and highly volatile MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across different periods. The beta values indicate high sensitivity to market movements, with values generally above 1, implying amplified price swings. The negative alpha values in recent years indicate underperformance against the market. Notably, the significant negative CAGR and MDD in the last few periods highlight serious underperformance.  The reduction in market capitalization (Cap(B)) further underscores the company's struggles.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 76.0% | 60.6% | 49.0% | 0.0 | 6.1 |
| 2016-2018  | 128.0% | 59.3% | 109.0% | 0.0 | 8.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 176.0% | 59.3% | 145.0% | 0.4 | 14.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 237.0% | 64.0% | 208.0% | 0.2 | 35.1 |
| 2019-2021  | -83.0% | 64.0% | -141.0% | 0.2 | 16.1 |
| 2020-2022  | -295.0% | 81.3% | -303.0% | 0.0 | 4.2 |
| 2021-2023  | -488.0% | 81.3% | -508.0% | -0.6 | 3.8 |
| 2022-2024  | -111.0% | 81.3% | -131.0% | -0.9 | 1.6 |
| 2023-2025  | -40.0% | 72.9% | -66.0% | -0.8 | 1.2 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock price shows a recent slight increase.  However, the moving averages suggest a downward trend.

* Closing Price: $7.06
* 5-Day Moving Average: $7.15
* 20-Day Moving Average: $7.14
* 60-Day Moving Average: $9.08

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating bearish momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3776 (Medium Risk) - suggests moderate risk.
* **RSI:** 45.62 - near the neutral level (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 1.124 - positive value, but not particularly strong, indicating some upward momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change:** -0.7 - indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -3044.8% -  This extremely negative expected return is concerning and warrants further investigation.  This figure suggests significant risk.  The high negative return is likely related to its underperformance relative to the S&P500.

The 1% price change from the previous close is not significant enough to be considered a rapid move in either direction.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows consistent negative EPS (Earnings Per Share) and relatively flat revenue. This is a significant cause for concern.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative EPS is crucial.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-05-01 | -0.53  | $0.63 B      |
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19  | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-08-01 | -4.92  | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-04-26 | -0.49  | $0.65 B      |
| 2025-05-01 | -0.49  | $0.65 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable, but profitability is concerning, given the negative ROE (Return on Equity) in recent quarters. High profit margins despite negative EPS and ROE warrants further analysis of accounting practices and capital allocation strategies.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31  | $0.63B  | 68.73%        |
| 2024-12-31  | $0.64B  | 70.50%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $0.64B  | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $0.64B  | 70.73%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $0.65B  | 69.89%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity  | ROE     |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| 2025-03-31  | $1.43B  | -6.52%  |
| 2024-12-31  | $1.49B  | -3.25%  |
| 2024-09-30  | $1.51B  | -2.21%  |
| 2024-06-30  | $1.50B  | -55.77% |
| 2024-03-31  | $2.29B  | -3.58%  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with negative cumulative returns.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, and the financial statements reveal negative EPS and fluctuating, but generally negative, ROE, despite relatively stable revenue and high profit margins.  The extremely negative expected return highlights the significant risk associated with this stock.  A long-term investment strategy would require a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the company's poor performance and a reassessment of the negative expected returns, potentially through deeper fundamental analysis.  Before making any investment decisions, consult with a financial advisor.
