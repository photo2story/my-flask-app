| 2023-2025  | -30.0%    | 22.9%    | -1.5     | 2.3     |        |

The consistently negative alpha in recent years highlights significant underperformance relative to the market.  The high beta values (especially in 2018-2020) indicate high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The sharp decline in market capitalization is also notable.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $13.51
* **Previous Close:** $12.55
* **Change:** +7.65%
* **5-day Moving Average:** $13.18
* **20-day Moving Average:** $10.94
* **60-day Moving Average:** $10.37

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting potential upward momentum in the short term. The recent 7.65% increase is a significant jump, possibly indicating a temporary bounce or market reaction.

* **RSI:** 74.50  (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.70 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -4334.6% (This extremely negative figure suggests a very high risk associated with long-term investment, even significantly underperforming the S&P 500).  This highlights the significant risk involved and emphasizes the need for careful consideration.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19   | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92   | $0.64 B      |
| 2024-04-26 | -$0.49   | $0.65 B      |
| 2023-10-27 | -$0.35   | $0.66 B      |
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35   | $0.66 B      |

Earnings show consistently negative EPS despite relatively stable revenue. The significant drop in EPS in August 2024 warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B  | 70.73%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B  | 69.89%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B  | 70.72%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.66B  | 71.83%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE       |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B  | -2.21%    |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B  | -55.77%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B  | -3.58%    |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B  | -1.24%    |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.29B  | -2.49%    |

While revenue remains relatively stable, the consistently negative ROE raises serious concerns about the company's profitability and long-term viability.  The substantial drop in equity and ROE in Q2 2024 needs further explanation.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

TDOC's stock performance has been significantly poor compared to the S&P 500, exhibiting negative alpha and high volatility. While recent price action shows a short-term upward trend, the negative EPS, negative ROE, and extremely negative projected long-term return indicate substantial risk.  The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, increasing the likelihood of a correction.  Investors considering a long-term investment should proceed with extreme caution and carefully consider the substantial risks involved.  Further investigation into the reasons for the significant drop in EPS in August 2024 and the decline in equity is crucial before making any investment decisions.
