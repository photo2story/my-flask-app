**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

The difference is a substantial -186.9%, placing it at the 2nd percentile (0.2 relative divergence) compared to its historical range (-188.5% to 710.6%).  The provided Alpha values consistently show 0.0, indicating that TDOC's returns are completely explained by market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $10.14
* **Last Market Price:** $10.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $9.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $9.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $9.82

The price is currently trading above its short-term moving averages, suggesting some upward momentum. However, it is below its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.  The recent slight price drop (-$0.01) is not significant enough to suggest a dramatic shift.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.33  (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.64 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** -6945.6% (This extremely negative figure suggests a very pessimistic long-term outlook relative to the S&P 500.  It is crucial to understand how this figure was calculated, as it seems unusually low.  Further investigation into the methodology is needed).  

The combination of a relatively high RSI and a negative recent relative divergence change suggests caution; although the PPO is positive, the extreme negative expected return needs further explanation and validation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data reveals consistent losses (negative EPS) despite relatively stable revenues hovering around $0.64B-$0.66B. This indicates significant challenges in profitability, which is further highlighted in the financial information section below. The variation in EPS from quarter-to-quarter highlights the volatility and unpredictability of the company's performance.

| Date         | EPS   | Revenue     |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31   | -0.19 | $0.64 B     |
| 2024-08-01   | -4.92 | $0.64 B     |
| 2024-04-26   | -0.49 | $0.65 B     |
| 2023-10-27   | -0.35 | $0.66 B     |

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows stable revenue but very concerning profitability. Profit margins remain high, hovering around 70%, but the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative and significantly so in some quarters. This suggests that, while the company is generating revenue, it is not effectively translating this into positive shareholder returns.  The high profit margin in the face of negative ROE indicates potential accounting issues or unusual expenses that warrant further investigation.

| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%        |

| 2023-09-30 | $0.66B  | 71.83%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity  | ROE       |

| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58%    |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Teladoc exhibits significant volatility and has substantially underperformed the S&P 500. While revenue remains relatively stable, the company is struggling with profitability, evidenced by consistently negative ROE and large losses.  The extremely low projected expected return (-6945.6%) requires urgent clarification.  Technical indicators present a mixed signal, although the price is showing some upward momentum in the short term.  Given the negative ROE and recurring losses, a long-term investment requires careful consideration and a deep dive into the company's operational efficiency and strategic direction to assess whether the current business model is sustainable. The high profit margin despite negative ROE needs thorough investigation.
