**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows strong growth in earlier periods but significant negative growth in recent years. The decline is alarming.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha, representing performance above the benchmark, is strongly positive in earlier periods but massively negative more recently, mirroring the CAGR trend. This signifies that TDOC is significantly underperforming its expected return based on its risk (beta).
*   **Beta:** Beta values have fluctuated, initially showing little correlation or slight negative correlation with the market and more recently showing a higher negative correlation. This suggests TDOC's price moves somewhat inversely with the market, though the negative correlation has lessened recently, nearing zero.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has decreased significantly, reflecting the stock's poor performance and investor confidence.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 7.12
*   **Last Market Data:** price: 7.12, previousClose: 7.25, change: -1.79%
*   **5-day SMA:** 7.214
*   **20-day SMA:** 7.4295
*   **60-day SMA:** 7.8605

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA).  The SMAs are trending downwards, which suggests a continued downtrend. The small difference between closing price and 5-day SMA indicates the price is not rising significantly higher or lower than recent trends.

**3) Market Indicators**

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - **NOTE:** This is contradictory to the overall picture. The MRI seems unreliable in this case.
*   **RSI:** 30.58 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively there)
*   **PPO:** -0.2133 (Below zero suggests bearish momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (132 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.3 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -10382.5% (Extremely negative expectation)

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI is near oversold, *potentially* indicating a possible short-term bounce.
*   The PPO confirms bearish momentum.
*   **The MRI suggesting "High Investment Recommended" is highly questionable and should be disregarded given all other data points.**  This is likely an anomaly or error in the calculation. The "Hybrid Signal" appears to be generated based on this flawed MRI, and therefore the recommendation should be ignored.
*   The negative divergence change and the extremely negative expected return are strong warning signs. The expected return figure is almost certainly an error, but directionally reflects severe negativity.

*   ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, reflecting the company's inability to generate profits from its equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Teladoc (TDOC) presents a highly concerning investment picture.

*   **Performance:** The stock has drastically underperformed the S&P 500 with a very negative cumulative return. The historical Alpha and Beta values demonstrate a sharp decline in performance compared to the market.
*   **Financials:**  The company is consistently unprofitable (negative EPS and ROE) with stagnating revenue and decreasing equity.
*   **Technical Indicators:** While the RSI suggests a *potential* for a short-term bounce, the overall trend is bearish. *The MRI is demonstrably wrong and should be ignored.*
*   **News & Analyst Sentiment:** News headlines are mixed, but concerns about Teladoc's competitive positioning are evident. Analyst sentiment is neutral, offering little confidence.
*   **Risks:** The high Maximum Drawdown indicates a high-risk investment.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this data, investing in Teladoc is highly risky and **not recommended**. The company's financial performance, stock performance, and overall outlook are significantly negative. A potential short-term bounce due to an oversold RSI is not enough to outweigh the fundamental problems. Investors should exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering this stock. The anomalous MRI reading should be considered erroneous and not used to inform investment decisions.
