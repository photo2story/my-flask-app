**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19  | 0.64 B$     |
| 2024-08-01 | -4.92  | 0.64 B$     |

| 2024-10-31 | -0.35  | 0.66 B$     |

TDOC has consistently reported negative EPS in recent quarters, indicating ongoing losses. Revenue has remained relatively flat.  The large negative EPS in August 2024 is particularly concerning.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a complete financial analysis.  This lack of readily available data is a significant concern.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC has experienced significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, showing high volatility and considerable risk. While short-term indicators suggest some upward momentum, the negative EPS, lack of key financial data, and extremely negative long-term expected return relative to the market paint a concerning picture.  The overbought RSI suggests caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the consistent losses and the missing financial data is crucial before considering any investment.  The current situation strongly advises against long-term investment unless significant changes in the company's performance and financial reporting occur.
