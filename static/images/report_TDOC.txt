**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $9.20
* **Previous Close:** $9.43
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $9.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $11.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $10.54

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price change (-2.44%) reflects a short-term decline.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 28.28 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -4.36 (Bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.1 (Short-term upward movement, but within a broader downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -5220.2% (This extremely negative value needs clarification.  It's likely an error or requires further context.  It doesn't represent a realistic long-term expectation.)

The low RSI suggests the stock may be oversold, potentially presenting a buying opportunity for some investors. However, the negative PPO and the significant negative expected return signal caution. The recent price drop (-2.44%) is a noticeable decline but doesn't constitute a dramatic "crash".

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date        | EPS      | Revenue     |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-31  | -0.19    | $0.64B      |
| 2024-08-01  | -4.92    | $0.64B      |
| 2024-04-26  | -0.49    | $0.65B      |
| 2023-10-27  | -0.35    | $0.66B      |
| 2024-10-31  | -0.35    | $0.66B      |

The earnings data reveals consistent negative EPS, indicating ongoing losses.  Revenue remains relatively stable but doesn't offset the significant losses.  The August 2024 EPS is particularly concerning, suggesting a substantial downturn in profitability.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B  | 70.50%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B  | 70.73%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B  | 69.89%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B  | 70.72%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity  | ROE      |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B  | -3.25%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B  | -2.21%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B  | -55.77%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B  | -3.58%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B  | -1.24%   |

While revenue shows relative stability, the negative ROE across most quarters is a major concern.  This indicates the company is not generating returns on its equity investments. The exceptionally low ROE in Q2 2024 (-55.77%) requires further investigation.  The consistently high profit margins seem incongruent with the negative EPS and ROE; this discrepancy needs further clarification.  This could be due to accounting practices or unusual one-off expenses.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

TDOC is currently significantly underperforming the market, showing a substantial negative return compared to the S&P 500.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the consistently negative EPS, negative ROE, and bearish momentum indicators raise serious concerns about the company's financial health and future prospects.  The extremely negative expected return is likely an error and should not be taken as a reliable forecast.   Before considering any investment, a thorough review of the company's financial statements and future growth prospects is critical.  The discrepancies between profit margins and ROE and EPS warrant further scrutiny.  The high beta suggests high volatility and sensitivity to market fluctuations, making it a riskier investment.
