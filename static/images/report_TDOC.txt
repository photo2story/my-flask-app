* **60-Day Moving Average:** $8.83

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, the relatively small difference between the closing price and moving averages suggests the upward trend is not overly strong.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 69.15 – Approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), suggesting potential near-term price correction.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.97 – Positive value indicates upward momentum, although relatively weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +0.52 – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – The provided expected return of 0% implies that, given the current situation, there is no expectation of outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment with regular contributions. This should be viewed with caution, as the model underlying this prediction is not elaborated.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show consistent losses (negative EPS) while revenue remains relatively stable around $0.64-$0.66 Billion.  The most recent earnings (2024-10-31) reported an EPS of -0.19, which should be compared to analysts' expectations to fully assess the performance.  Lack of consensus estimates and future projections limit a robust analysis.

**5.  Quarterly Financial Data Analysis (Combined with Point 6):**

The provided financial data reveals mixed signals.  Revenue is fairly stable, but profit margins, while high (70-72%), don't reflect strong profitability given the negative EPS.  More concerning is the negative Return on Equity (ROE), ranging from -55.77% to -1.24%, indicating the company is not generating returns on shareholder investments. This needs further investigation into the reasons for such low ROE.

**8. Overall Summary:**

TDOC significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent price action shows a slight upward trend, technical indicators suggest caution. Negative EPS and negative ROE raise significant concerns about the company's financial health.  The 0% expected return highlights a lack of confidence in outperformance compared to the broader market.  Further investigation into the reasons for negative ROE and thorough analysis of the most recent earnings reports (including comparison to analyst expectations and future forecasts) along with relevant recent news articles from reliable sources are crucial before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The stable revenue is positive, but the company must address its profitability issues.
