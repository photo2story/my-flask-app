| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($12.55) is below its 5-day ($12.87), 20-day ($10.73), and 60-day ($10.29) moving averages. This suggests a short-term downtrend, although the price is slightly above the longer-term averages.  The recent -3.76% price drop indicates a notable decrease.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 69.85 suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory, while the PPO of 2.77 indicates some upward momentum. The recent relative divergence of +0.7 suggests a short-term upward trend, which contradicts the recent price drop.  The -4346.8% expected return is exceptionally negative and unrealistic, possibly due to an error in calculation or a flawed model.  Long-term investment (2+ years) is highly risky given the current trends.  More realistic analysis is needed to determine the long-term return potential relative to the S&P 500.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data show consistent losses (negative EPS) despite relatively stable revenue.  This signals a serious profitability issue for the company.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, but profit margins are high despite substantial losses.  The equity and ROE figures reveal a concerning trend of declining equity and negative ROE, indicating significant financial challenges.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance is significantly lagging behind the S&P 500, showing a consistent pattern of underperformance.  While revenue remains relatively stable, the company is experiencing substantial losses, reflected in negative EPS and ROE.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with RSI nearing overbought levels and PPO suggesting upward momentum. However, the recent price drop and consistently negative earnings suggest a high-risk investment. The extremely negative projected return needs further investigation and should not be considered reliable without additional analysis.  The company's current financial position necessitates a thorough assessment of its long-term viability before considering any investment.  Further investigation into the reasons for the persistent losses is crucial.  The high profit margins despite substantial losses require further clarification.  This stock presents significant risks and is not recommended for risk-averse investors.
