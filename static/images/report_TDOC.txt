* **Expected Return:** -7153.8% (extremely negative, implying significant potential losses compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon). This exceptionally low expected return suggests extremely high risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals consistent negative EPS and relatively stable revenue.  This suggests a concerning lack of profitability despite consistent revenues.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-31 | -0.19 | 0.64 B$ |
| 2024-08-01 | -4.92 | 0.64 B$ |
| 2024-04-26 | -0.49 | 0.65 B$ |
| 2023-10-27 | -0.35 | 0.66 B$ |
| 2024-10-31 | -0.35 | 0.66 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information confirms low profitability and negative ROE.  While revenue remains relatively stable, the company is clearly not generating profits. The high profit margins are misleading because they are based on a negative earnings basis.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94% |

| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72% |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.66B | 71.83% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|

| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77% |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58% |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC shows extremely weak performance against the S&P 500, characterized by consistently negative returns and high risk (high negative alpha and high MDD).  The company is unprofitable despite relatively stable revenue.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, and the extremely negative expected return cautions against investment unless the underlying business fundamentals undergo a significant positive change.  Current data strongly suggests a high-risk investment with low potential for reward compared to the broader market.  Further investigation into the reasons for the persistent losses and the company's strategic plan for profitability is crucial before considering any investment.
