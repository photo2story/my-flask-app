**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | -$0.19 | $0.64B        |
| 2024-08-01 | -$4.92 | $0.64B        |

| 2024-10-31 | -$0.35 | $0.66B        |

The recent earnings show significant and consistent losses (negative EPS). While revenue remains relatively stable, the lack of profitability is a major concern. The massive loss in August 2024 is a significant negative.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B | 71.94%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B | 70.73%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.65B | 69.89%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.66B | 70.72%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $0.66B | 71.83%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity  | ROE      |

| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B | -2.21%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B | -55.77%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.29B | -3.58%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $2.33B | -1.24%   |
| 2023-09-30 | $2.29B | -2.49%   |

Despite relatively stable revenue and high profit margins, the Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital. The exceptionally low ROE in Q2 2024 is alarming.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance has been severely disappointing compared to the S&P 500.  While revenue remains relatively stable, the persistent losses (negative EPS and ROE), coupled with bearish technical indicators and a highly negative projected long-term return, paint a grim picture.  The significant negative EPS reported in August 2024 warrants further investigation.  The high volatility observed in historical data adds to the risk.  Currently, the stock appears highly risky, and a long-term investment requires careful consideration of the substantial downside risk and potential for further losses.  Before investing,  a thorough review of the company's strategic plans to improve profitability is crucial.  The -7153.8% expected return is likely an error and should be disregarded without clarification on its calculation.
