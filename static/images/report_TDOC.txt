**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  Significant volatility.  High growth in earlier periods (2018-2020), followed by substantial declines.
*   **MDD:**  High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate significant risk and price volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha in recent years suggests underperformance relative to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:**  The negative Beta in recent periods suggests an inverse correlation with the market, meaning TDOC may move in the opposite direction of the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap has significantly decreased, reflecting the stock's poor performance.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movements**

*   **Current Price:** $7.68
*   **Previous Close:** $7.77
*   **Change:** -1.16%
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 7.716
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 7.6377
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 7.7576

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages but above the 20-day moving average. This suggests a possible short-term downward trend, but it's not definitive. The negative change from the previous close (-1.16%) indicates some recent selling pressure.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3233 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 50.0 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.1134

*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.2 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -11518.4% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  The low MRI suggests relatively low market risk, which might seem contradictory given the stock's performance.
*   **RSI:** The neutral RSI indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The Positive PPO number signals that the 20 day EMA is above the 60 day EMA which can signal upward price movement.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Suggests buying 80% with caution.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** A negative change in relative deviation indicates a short-term downward trend compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is concerning and suggests that, based on the model, long-term investment in TDOC is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.
*   **Price Change:** The price change from previous close to now is -1.16% which is negligible.
