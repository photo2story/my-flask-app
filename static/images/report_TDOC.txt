*   **RSI:** 32.88

*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -0.7 (Negative - Short-term Decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** -8524.5%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator is currently in the "Low Risk" range. However, this indicator seems to be a general market risk indicator and may not be specific to TDOC.
*   **RSI:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 32.88 suggests that the stock is approaching oversold conditions.  This *could* indicate a potential for a rebound, but in a downtrend, it could stay oversold for an extended period.
*   **PPO:** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) of -0.63 indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends selling 1.0% of holdings and increasing the cash ratio to 69%. This is a bearish signal.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** A negative change in relative divergence indicates short-term underperformance compared to its benchmark.
*   **Expected Return:** The drastically negative expected return (-8524.5%) is highly unusual and likely a data error. This value is not realistic.

The significant price change (8.3%) should be factored into decision making.

**Capital and Profitability:**

|------------|---------|----------|
| 2025-06-30 | $1.42B  | -2.30%   |

| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B  | -2.21%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B  | -55.77%  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue:** As with the earnings data, revenue is consistent.
*   **Profit Margin:** Gross profit margins are consistently high (around 70%), suggesting good cost control at the operational level. This contrasts with the negative EPS, indicating that operating expenses, interest, and/or taxes are exceeding gross profit.
*   **Equity:** Equity has been decreasing slightly over the last few quarters.
*   **ROE:** Return on Equity (ROE) is negative, reflecting the company's inability to generate profits from its equity base.  The exceptionally negative ROE in 2024-06-30 warrants further investigation as it may signal a significant one-time loss or accounting adjustment.

### 7. Overall Summary

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) presents a mixed picture.

**Key Concerns:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:**  TDOC has substantially underperformed the S&P 500, and is performing at the bottom of its historical divergence range.
*   **Negative Profitability:** Consistent negative EPS and ROE indicate that the company is not currently profitable.
*   **Decreasing Equity:** A slight decrease in equity over recent quarters is a minor concern.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** hybrid signal recommends selling 1.0% of holdings and increasing the cash ratio to 69%.
*   **Expected Return:** The drastically negative expected return (-8524.5%) is highly unusual and likely a data error.

**Potential Positives:**

*   **High Profit Margins:** High gross profit margins suggest underlying business strength *if* operating expenses can be managed more effectively.
*   **Potential Rebound:** The RSI indicates near oversold conditions.
*   **Recent Price Increase:** The recent price increase suggest positive sentiment or some news.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, TDOC appears to be a high-risk investment. The underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative profitability, and negative trend in equity are significant concerns. While high profit margins and a recent price increase offer some hope, a turnaround strategy and a return to profitability are essential for a positive outlook. Investors should carefully monitor news and company announcements, particularly regarding cost management and strategies to achieve profitability. The analyst discussions and volatility suggest that the stock is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
