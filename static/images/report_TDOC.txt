## Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Teladoc Health Inc. (TDOC) is a telehealth company providing virtual care services.  Over the observed period, TDOC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). The cumulative return for TDOC is -58.59%, while VOO's is 128.63%.  This represents a massive divergence of -187.2 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 0.9 indicates that this underperformance is near the lower extreme of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

The provided CAGR data shows periods of substantial growth followed by dramatic declines, highlighting the volatility inherent in TDOC's performance. The high Beta values indicate significant sensitivity to overall market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $11.98
* **5-day Moving Average:** $11.48
* **20-day Moving Average:** $9.87
* **60-day Moving Average:** $9.12

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend.  The closing price of 11.93 suggests a slight recent increase, although not a dramatic “spike” indicating a 급반등 (sudden surge).


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 71.79  (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.57 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** NaN (-) (Insufficient data to analyze short-term divergence).
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates that the model predicts no excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), given the current circumstances.  This is a prediction, and actual results may vary significantly.)

The high RSI suggests potential short-term overbought conditions, while the positive PPO indicates continued buying pressure.  The lack of data on recent relative divergence prevents a conclusive short-term trend assessment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a consistent pattern of negative EPS over the past several quarters.  Revenue has remained relatively flat around $0.64 - $0.66 Billion.  There's no information on earnings expectations to determine beats or misses.  Significant negative EPS changes are observable, especially the -4.92 EPS in Q2 2024.  Profit margins remain relatively stable, yet high, despite negative EPS.  This discrepancy warrants further investigation into the company's cost structure and operational efficiency.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable but shows a slight downward trend.  Profit margins are consistently high (70-72%), despite negative EPS, suggesting potential accounting adjustments or unusual expense recognition.  Equity fluctuates, and ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on shareholder equity.  The discrepancy between high profit margins and negative ROE needs further scrutiny.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News (within the last 2 days):** No data provided to assess.
* **Recent Market Outlook:**  Not specified.
* **Analyst Opinions:**  Not included.

Missing information significantly limits the analysis of the current market sentiment and expert opinions.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

TDOC's performance has been significantly poor relative to the S&P 500 over the observed period. While recent price action suggests a potential short-term upward trend, several red flags exist:  consistently negative EPS despite high profit margins, negative ROE,  high RSI suggesting overbought conditions and the lack of positive long-term expected returns. The stability of revenue is a positive aspect, but not enough to outweigh the serious profitability concerns.  More information is needed on recent news, analyst opinions, and earnings expectations to provide a more complete assessment.  The extremely high volatility and significant underperformance relative to the market pose substantial risk to investors.  Further investigation into the causes of negative EPS despite high profit margins is crucial before making any investment decisions.
