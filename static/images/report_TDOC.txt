    *   20-day: 7.45
    *   60-day: 7.58

**Analysis:**  The recent market data shows a notable 2% drop in price. The current price is below all three moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend. The 5-day moving average is below the 20-day moving average, further reinforcing this bearish signal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.329 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 48.97 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.553
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_1%_Buy 90% of cash (757 shares - Safe - MRI:0.33) (Cash Ratio: 1% on 2025-08-18)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** -0.3 (Negative Trend)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -9994.1% (Extremely Negative)

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates low market risk, which is contradictory to other indicators. The RSI is neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The negative change in relative deviation over the last 20 days confirms the short-term decline.  The Hybrid Signal suggests a cautious buying approach with a small allocation, guided by the low MRI.  The "Safe" designation and low MRI appear inconsistent with the extremely negative expected return. *The extremely negative expected return figure warrants further investigation as it seems unrealistic. This could be due to data errors, extremely long-term projections or a very specific set of assumptions used in the calculation.* The change of -2.0% is notable. The Hybrid Signal is 'cash_1%_Buy' is the trading signal, but it is not clear that it reflects the actual changes.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출        |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2025-07-30 | -0.19 | 0.63 B$     |
| 2025-05-01 | -0.53 | 0.63 B$     |

| 2024-08-01 | -4.92 | 0.64 B$     |
| 2025-07-30 | -4.92 | 0.64 B$ |

**Analysis:** The company is consistently reporting losses (negative EPS). Revenue has been relatively stable around $0.63-0.64 billion. The large loss reported on 2024-08-01 and 2025-07-30 is a significant concern.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| 2025-06-30 | $0.63B  | 69.85%        |
| 2025-03-31 | $0.63B  | 68.73%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $0.64B  | 70.50%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.64B  | 71.94%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.64B  | 70.73%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity  | ROE      |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 2025-06-30 | $1.42B  | -2.30%   |
| 2025-03-31 | $1.43B  | -6.52%   |
| 2024-12-31 | $1.49B  | -3.25%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.51B  | -2.21%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.50B  | -55.77%  |

**Analysis:** Revenue has been stable.  Profit margins appear healthy, but the negative Return on Equity (ROE) values indicate that the company is not effectively generating profits from its equity. The sharp negative ROE in Q2 2024 (-55.77%) requires investigation, as it coincides with large losses in the earnings analysis.  Equity is decreasing.

**7. Overall Analysis and Summary**

TDOC's performance has been severely lagging the S&P 500, with a significant negative cumulative return and historical underperformance. The company's historical growth (pre-2020) was impressive, but recent performance has been very poor, marked by substantial losses and negative alpha generation.

Technically, the stock is in a short-term downtrend, trading below key moving averages.  The neutral RSI offers little directional guidance. The MRI indicates low risk, but this may be misleading given other data. The recent 2% drop in price highlights ongoing volatility.

Recent earnings reports show consistent losses despite stable revenue. The negative ROE figures further underscore the company's struggles with profitability. Recent News suggest the stock is subject to analyst scrutiny and volatility.

**In conclusion, based on the provided data, Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) appears to be a high-risk investment.  The company's current financial performance, technical indicators, and market sentiment suggest caution.  Investors should carefully consider the risks and conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions.** The extremely negative expected return should be clarified.
