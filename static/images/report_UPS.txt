The company's performance relative to the broader market has been inconsistent, with periods of significant outperformance followed by periods of underperformance.

The 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 should be treated cautiously as its calculation and validity isn't explained.  A thorough review of external financial news and analysis is crucial for a fully informed investment decision.
