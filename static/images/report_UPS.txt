**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  The provided data shows UPS's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last date in the data is -97.6%, indicating substantial underperformance relative to the benchmark.  The relative divergence of -97.6% places UPS at the 3.6th percentile of its historical range compared to VOO, suggesting prolonged underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $135.72
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $135.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $132.81

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor downward trend in the very short term.  However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a positive trend over the medium and longer term.  The last market price of $134.05 is lower than the closing price.

* **PPO:** 0.28 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)

* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates no expected excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This number needs further context or a more detailed calculation).

The RSI and PPO suggest a relatively neutral to slightly positive outlook. The lack of data on relative divergence prevents a complete assessment of short-term momentum.  The 0% expected return needs clarification; a more sophisticated model is required to make an accurate prediction.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. While recent earnings show increasing EPS and generally increasing revenue, profit margins and ROE have fluctuated.
