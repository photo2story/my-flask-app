**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $121.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $119.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $116.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $121.42

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting some recent upward momentum, but still relatively close to recent averages, indicating a lack of strong directional trend.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (71.81):**  Indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory.  Values above 70 generally suggest the stock may be overvalued in the short term and susceptible to a correction.

* **PPO (0.81):** A positive PPO value suggests bullish momentum. However, the magnitude is not excessively high.

* **Recent Relative Strength (20-day):** A 6.5% increase in relative strength implies short-term upward momentum, but the overbought RSI suggests this momentum may be unsustainable.

* **Expected Return (-48%):** This is a remarkably negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This strongly suggests significant underperformance is anticipated. Given the current price movement, the slight uptick should be viewed with caution.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue        |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.8   | $22.25 B       |

| 2024-11-06 | 1.31  | $21.06 B       | *(Duplicate Entry)*


There appears to be a duplicate entry for November 6th, 2024.  EPS and Revenue show a generally increasing trend, but further data is required for a conclusive analysis. Noteworthy is the substantial increase in EPS from May to August 2024.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the provided time horizon.  While recent earnings show some positive momentum, several factors raise concerns: negative CAGR, high MDD, an overbought RSI, and a dramatically negative expected return against the market benchmark. While the recent price increase suggests a short-term upswing, the long-term outlook for UPS remains considerably weaker than that of the broader market.  Investors considering a long-term position should carefully weigh the risks and the projected underperformance relative to a diversified market index fund like VOO. Further research and a more comprehensive analysis incorporating broader economic factors are advised before making any investment decision.
