**0. Executive Summary:**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing negative alpha and high beta. Recent financial performance shows mixed signals, with declining revenue and profit margin in recent quarters, despite increased EPS.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, but significant downside risks remain.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

UPS's cumulative return (3.68%) is significantly lower than the S&P 500's (61.89%). This results in a large negative divergence (-58.2), placing it in the 11.2th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500.

The provided alpha and beta data reveal significant volatility and underperformance relative to the market.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others demonstrate substantial negative alpha, particularly in recent years. The high beta suggests UPS is significantly more volatile than the overall market.  Consistent negative alpha across several years indicates a troubling trend of underperformance. The consistent high Beta value suggests a significant correlation with the overall market movements.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS is currently underperforming the market significantly. While some short-term indicators suggest potential for a bounce (oversold RSI), the long-term trend remains bearish. The significant negative price change, negative PPO, and below-average moving averages reinforce this bearish outlook.  Inconsistent earnings data needs clarification, as well as a deeper dive into the reasons behind the recent significant price drop. Although the expected return over the long term is positive compared to the S&P 500, the high risk and inconsistent financial performance need careful consideration before making any investment decisions.  Further research is needed to understand the drivers of recent performance and assess the long-term outlook.
