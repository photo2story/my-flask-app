As of the last data point, UPS's cumulative return (29.28%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (123.86%). The difference is -94.58%, placing it at the 5.71 percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial underperformance compared to the broader market index.  The provided alpha and beta analysis shows mixed performance relative to the market over various periods.

* **60-day Moving Average:** $131.73

The price is slightly above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent upward momentum, but below the 60-day moving average which indicates a longer-term downward trend.  The relatively close proximity of the averages suggests some consolidation or sideways movement.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.14 - A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum, further supporting the observation of the recent downward trend.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +4.28 -  Indicates a short-term upward trend in the relative strength of UPS compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% - The provided expected return suggests no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon based on the current data.  This aligns with the overall underperformance observed.
* **Note:** If the $134.1 price represents a significant recent jump (e.g., a substantial daily increase), then it might reflect a temporary short-term surge, potentially driven by news events or market sentiment not fully captured in the current data.


**4. Recent Financials and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows a general trend of increasing revenue and relatively stable EPS over the last few quarters. However, there seems to be slight volatility.

The most recent EPS (1.8) is higher than the preceding quarters, and the provided revenue ($22.25B) is in line with recent past performance.  Further analysis is needed to compare these figures against analyst expectations to determine whether the results are above or below market consensus.  Without analyst estimates, it's difficult to ascertain if these numbers are positive or negative.
