* **Closing Price:** $114.23
* **Last Market Price:** $111.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $126.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $127.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $129.18

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 37.85 (Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.)
* **PPO:** -1.03 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -4.5% (Short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** -529.1% (This extremely negative figure requires further investigation and context.  It likely reflects the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 over the observed period and doesn't represent a realistic prediction of future returns.)  The large negative change in the last market price further supports this.  The large negative expected return should be interpreted cautiously, as it is likely heavily influenced by past underperformance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS | Revenue       |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.8 | $22.25B       |
| 2024-08-07 | 1.65 | $21.82B       |

| 2024-11-06 | 1.31 | $21.06B       |

There's a duplicate entry for 2024-11-06.  EPS shows a generally increasing trend, although revenue growth is less consistent. Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this trend and its impact on future stock performance.  Note that the reported EPS appears inconsistent between quarters and needs further review for accuracy.

**6. Summary:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent earnings show some growth in EPS, revenue growth is less consistent.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, with the price trading below key moving averages. The extremely negative expected return should be carefully considered and is mainly reflective of the historical underperformance, not necessarily a future prediction.  Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying causes of this underperformance and to assess the long-term prospects for UPS. The inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate earnings data,  extremely low predicted return) warrant further scrutiny before making any investment decisions.  A thorough review of the underlying economic factors influencing the companyâ€™s performance is required to offer a more complete assessment.
