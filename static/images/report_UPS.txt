2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the UPS stock information you provided, including analysis:

**1. Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global leader in logistics, offering a broad range of solutions including transporting packages and freight.
*   **UPS Cumulative Return:** -12.35%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 105.07%
*   **Divergence:** -117.4 (Relative Divergence: 7.8)

**Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The divergence of -117.4, with a relative divergence of only 7.8, indicates that UPS's underperformance is near its worst levels compared to historical data (meaning the recent divergence is much closer to the minimum than the maximum of past divergences). This suggests a significant period of relative weakness for UPS.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|--------|

| 2018-2020  | 32.0%   | 82.0%   | 0.0%    | 0.8   | 142.9  |
| 2019-2021  | 103.0%  | 82.0%   | 27.0%   | 0.8   | 181.8  |
| 2020-2022  | 68.0%   | 82.2%   | 49.0%   | 0.8   | 147.5  |
| 2021-2023  | 1.0%    | 82.2%   | -27.0%  | 0.9   | 133.4  |
| 2022-2024  | -38.0%  | 82.1%   | -68.0%  | 0.9   | 107.0  |
| 2023-2025  | -46.0%  | 75.2%   | -114.0% | 0.8   | 84.2   |

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows periods of strong growth (2019-2021) and periods of significant decline (2022-2025). The recent negative CAGR is concerning.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant price volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures performance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500). The negative alpha values, especially in recent years, confirm UPS's underperformance compared to its benchmark. Alpha decline may mean its competitive advantage has been reduced (due to increase in cost, reduction in Revenue).
*   **Beta:** Beta hovers around 0.8-1.0, suggesting that UPS's price movement is similar to the market, although slightly less volatile (beta < 1).

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 99.19
*   **Last Market Change:** -0.45
*   **5-day SMA:** 99.94
*   **20-day SMA:** 99.36
*   **60-day SMA:** 94.05

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is below both the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downtrend.
*   However, the 20-day SMA is very close to the current price.
*   The 60-day SMA is significantly lower than the current price, which *could* suggest an upward trend over a longer time horizon, but needs to be considered in light of other factors.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Hybrid Signal**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 47.18
*   **PPO:** -0.39
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 0.5 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The Medium Investment recommendation suggests the model sees a balance between risk and potential reward.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 47.18 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO (-0.39) suggests a slight downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends investing all available cash.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The positive divergence change indicates a recent short-term increase in relative performance.
*   **Expected Return:** 0% expected return is concerning, as it suggests little to no projected gain over the long term.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   Several articles discuss UPS's struggles in 2025 and potential for future recovery.
*   Dividend yield is highlighted as a positive aspect.
*   Strategic overhaul and scrutiny are mentioned.
*   One article questions if investing $10,000 in UPS could make you a millionaire, likely in a speculative context.
*   Another article covers why the market dipped, but UPS gained today.

**Analysis:**

The news headlines suggest a mixed sentiment. While some articles highlight potential upsides like the dividend and possible future recovery, others point to current challenges and strategic shifts. The focus on the stock price slipping below $100 reinforces the recent struggles.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.23)
*   **Target Price:** 103.83 (Avg) / 122.00 (High) / 75.00 (Low)

**Analysis:**

Despite the recent underperformance, analysts generally have a "Buy" rating on the stock. The average target price of 103.83 suggests a potential upside from the current price, but the wide range (75.00 - 122.00) indicates uncertainty. The lack of recent rating changes makes this a bit stale of the information.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

UPS has underperformed significantly compared to the S&P 500. Recent financial performance (declining revenue, EPS, profit margins, and ROE) paints a concerning picture. While analysts maintain a "Buy" rating, the target price range is wide, reflecting uncertainty. The market risk indicator suggests medium investment risk, and the hybrid signal recommends buying, but the expected return is 0%. Recent news highlights both potential upsides and ongoing challenges.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on this data, a cautious approach is warranted. The underperformance, declining financials, and mixed news sentiment raise red flags. While analysts are generally positive, the 0% expected return and potential for continued strategic overhauls and market fluctuation suggest waiting for more positive momentum or a clearer sign of recovery before investing. Given the data, it is recommended that one reconsiders the buy signal.
