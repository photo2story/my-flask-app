**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS is currently experiencing significant underperformance relative to the market.  While the company shows some positive financial indicators (earnings growth, relatively healthy profit margins), the negative price action, oversold RSI, negative PPO, and severely negative expected return paint a bearish picture.  The high beta suggests substantial market sensitivity. The recent sharp price drop warrants close monitoring for potential further declines. Long-term investors might consider the current valuation, but should carefully assess the risks and closely monitor the company's performance and news.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent price drop and the duplicate data entry is crucial.
