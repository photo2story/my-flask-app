*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -111.5 (Relative Divergence: 8.3)

**Analysis:** UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period for which data is available.  The divergence of -111.5 indicates a substantial performance gap.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

*   **Year: 2024-2026**
*   **CAGR: 1.0%**
*   **MDD: 81.6%**
*   **Alpha: -105.0%**
*   **Beta: -0.0**
*   **Cap(B): 84.6**

**Analysis:**

*   **Negative Alpha:** The substantial negative Alpha (-105.0%) confirms significant underperformance relative to the market (S&P 500). An alpha of -105.0% means that the investment has underperformed its benchmark by 105.0% on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Low Beta:** A Beta of -0.0 indicates that the stock has little to no correlation with the overall market.
*   **High MDD:** A high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 81.6% indicates a large potential loss from peak to trough during the period.
*   **Low CAGR:** A low Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 1.0% indicates a low growth rate on the investment.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 99.64
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 99.75, Previous Close: 99.64, Change: 0.11
*   **5-day SMA:** 100.14
*   **20-day SMA:** 99.28
*   **60-day SMA:** 93.85

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently hovering around $99.  The 5-day SMA is slightly above the current price, while the 20-day SMA is near the current price, and the 60-day SMA is significantly lower.  This suggests a potential short-term downward trend, but the 20-day SMA being close to the current price implies that the downward trend may be stabilizing.

**3) Index Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 63.10
*   **PPO:** -0.32
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 90% of cash (3 shares - Safe - MRI: 0.80)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -1.0 (Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -396.8%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A MRI of 0.9 suggests a medium level of investment risk, though close to the "High Investment Recommended" level.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 63.10 is nearing the overbought territory (typically above 70), but not quite there yet.
*   **PPO:** The PPO of -0.32 indicates that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying 90% with a safe profile, indicating an intention to take advantage of undervalued stock price, but also considers the potential for downside risk (MRI:0.80).
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The recent decrease in relative divergence indicates a short-term decline in relative performance compared to S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The highly negative expected return of -396.8% is a red flag, suggesting very poor future performance.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   Multiple articles focus on UPS's dividend yield and whether it's a good investment, especially with the stock price under $105 and even $100.
*   Some articles question if investing $10,000 in UPS can make you a millionaire.
*   A comparison is made between UPS and Enterprise Products Partners as dividend stocks.

**Analysis:** The news sentiment seems mixed. While there is a focus on the attractive dividend, the questioning headlines ("Can it make you a millionaire?", "Where will it be in 1 year?") suggest some uncertainty about the stock's future performance. The emphasis on the dividend implies that investors may be drawn to UPS primarily for its income-generating potential rather than significant capital appreciation.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~2.23)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 103.83 / 122.00 / 75.00

**Analysis:**  Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating on UPS with an average target price of $103.83. This suggests they believe the stock is currently undervalued. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices ($75 to $122) indicates a lack of strong conviction and potential disagreement among analysts.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

UPS is facing a challenging environment. It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and exhibits a negative alpha, indicating poor risk-adjusted returns. Revenue, profit margins, and ROE are all showing decreasing trends. The news highlights the appeal of its dividend yield, but articles question its future growth prospects. While analysts maintain a "Buy" rating, the wide range in target prices suggests uncertainty.

**Overall, the data paints a concerning picture for UPS.**  The attractive dividend yield might appeal to income-seeking investors, but the declining financial metrics and poor relative performance should give investors pause. The highly negative expected return is particularly alarming. The recent short-term price movements are also not significantly trending upwards. While analyst opinions still lean towards "Buy", the significant gap between high and low target price shows uncertainty and disagreement.
