**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |

| 2024-11-06 | 1.31 | $21.06 B      |

There's a discrepancy in the November 6th, 2024 data.  Assuming the first entry is correct, EPS shows a clear upward trend. Revenue shows a slight upward trend, although relatively flat in recent quarters.  Further investigation is needed to clarify the duplicated entry.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS currently shows significant underperformance against the S&P 500, with a large negative return difference. However, the long-term expected return suggests potential for outperformance in a longer-term investment strategy (2+ years).  Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition, indicating a possible short-term rebound.  Earnings show growth in EPS, but revenue growth is modest.  The companyâ€™s financial health appears sound, with healthy profit margins and relatively stable equity.  Further investigation is required to reconcile the discrepancy in the November 6th, 2024 earnings data.  Given the high market risk indicator and current bearish momentum, investors should proceed with caution and carefully monitor the market and the company's performance.  A long-term perspective and careful risk management are advisable.
