**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has shown inconsistent performance compared to the S&P 500, significantly underperforming in the long term.

The data suggests a cautious approach is warranted.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and a deeper analysis of the underlying drivers of recent performance changes are needed before making any investment decisions.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a critical factor to consider for long-term investment strategies.
