*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuates significantly, showing periods of strong growth (e.g., 2019-2021) and substantial declines (e.g., 2022-2024). Recent years indicate negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Relatively high MDD values across all periods, suggesting significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:**  The Alpha is largely negative. Alpha measures performance on a risk-adjusted basis. Positive Alpha indicates better performance than predicted by the Beta.  Negative Alpha, as seen in most periods, means UPS underperformed relative to its risk (Beta). Recent years show very negative Alpha values.
*   **Beta:** Fluctuates but recent periods show Beta above 0, indicating UPS has recently been moving in the same direction as the market, and a Beta above 1 suggests higher volatility than the market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 101.92
*   **Previous Close:** 102.08
*   **Change:** -0.16
*   **5-day SMA:** 101.028
*   **20-day SMA:** 97.6785
*   **60-day SMA:** 92.283

*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly down from the previous close. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, which is above the 60-day SMA.  This suggests a potential short-term upward trend, but the longer-term trend (60-day SMA) is still below both shorter-term averages.

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 0.4 (+) (Indicates short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return:** -302.1% (Very negative, indicating expected underperformance vs. the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.)

The negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting analysts are very pessimistic about UPS's future performance compared to the market. The Hybrid signal recommends buying shares, but this might be contradicted by other indicators.
