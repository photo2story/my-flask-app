**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE           |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $16.72B     | 10.29%        |

Equity fluctuates slightly, and ROE also shows a downward trend. This might be a cause for concern regarding long-term profitability and investor confidence.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS is currently facing a challenging period.  While the long-term expected return is positive, several indicators point to a bearish short-term outlook. The significant underperformance against the S&P 500, the negative technical indicators (low RSI, negative PPO, high MRI), and price movement below key moving averages paint a picture of substantial risk. While recent earnings show some increase in EPS, revenue growth is concerning.  The declining ROE and fluctuating equity further add to the uncertainty.  A thorough analysis of the full financial statements and consideration of external factors (economic conditions, industry competition) are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data suggests caution is warranted at this time.
