**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, despite showing generally positive earnings growth.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, although RSI indicates potential oversold conditions. The projected long-term expected return is very high, but this requires further investigation and should be considered in context of the substantial recent losses (CAGR -65%, -77%).  A thorough examination of the reasons for the underperformance, considering macroeconomic factors and company-specific events, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data presents conflicting signals; while fundamentals appear relatively healthy, recent price action and the substantial underperformance relative to the market warrant caution.  The extremely high projected return should be treated with skepticism until further investigation and validation.  Additional qualitative analysis (e.g., industry trends, competitive landscape) is strongly recommended.
