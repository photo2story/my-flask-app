**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered. While it shows periods of strong performance, the recent trend is bearish, indicated by its price being below key moving averages and negative PPO.  The high expected return of 115.9% is not supported by the current financial and market data. Further investigation is needed to reconcile the discrepancies in CAGR and cumulative return, and to validate the expected return figure.  The financial information shows a recent decline in profitability and ROE.  Careful consideration should be given before investing in UPS, and a thorough analysis of the underlying reasons for recent underperformance is necessary.  The duplicated data entry needs correction.
