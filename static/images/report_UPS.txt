**6. Overall Conclusion:**

UPS has demonstrated significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, particularly in recent years. While the company shows periods of strong growth and maintains healthy financial metrics (revenue, profit margins), the negative long-term expected return and overbought technical indicators raise concerns.  The recent earnings show increasing EPS, but revenue growth is moderate.  Further investigation is required to determine the reasons for underperformance and the validity of the extremely negative long-term return projection.  Before investing, it is crucial to address the data discrepancies and thoroughly evaluate macroeconomic factors, industry trends, and the company's long-term strategic direction.  The current data suggests caution is warranted.
