## United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Stock Review

This report analyzes United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) stock performance, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

United Parcel Service Inc. is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 30.31% for UPS, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 124.78%. The difference is -94.47%, placing its relative performance at the 5.79th percentile based on historical data. This indicates UPS's underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance over the years, with periods of strong growth followed by periods of decline.  The recent period (2022-2024) shows a negative CAGR, indicating significant underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $135.13 (Last Market: $135.19)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $133.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $133.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $131.85

The closing price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend, but below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 52.92 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.02 (Slightly bearish)
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** 5.79 (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0%.  The provided data doesn't explicitly state the methodology for calculating the 0.0% expected return.  Given the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, a long-term (2+ years) investment in UPS would likely underperform the S&P 500 unless significant changes in the company's fundamentals occur.  The slight positive short-term momentum does not outweigh the longer-term underperformance.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows generally increasing revenue but inconsistent EPS growth. While revenue shows consistent growth (except for a slight dip), EPS shows some fluctuation. The latest earnings report (2024-11-06) shows EPS at $1.8, which needs to be compared to analyst expectations to determine whether the results were better or worse than anticipated.  Without this crucial comparison, a complete assessment of the recent performance is not possible.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has been relatively stable, with a slight decline in Q3 2023 and a subsequent increase. Profit margins have fluctuated between 15% and 17%, with a peak at 19.34% in Q4 2023.  A comparison of margins to industry averages is needed to assess their competitiveness.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows some fluctuations but remains generally stable. Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates significantly, indicating varied profitability throughout the reported quarters.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

(This section requires access to recent news sources such as Shacknews and Finbold to provide an accurate analysis of recent news, market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.  Information on any recent earnings news, including whether it exceeded or missed expectations, is crucial for a comprehensive analysis.)


**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the provided period. While recent price action shows some short-term upward momentum, the longer-term trend and the 0.0% expected return suggest underperformance is likely to continue unless significant changes occur.  The inconsistent EPS growth and the need for comparison of the recent earnings report to analyst expectations are key factors limiting a definitive conclusion.  Further research into recent news, analyst opinions, and industry benchmarks is necessary to form a complete picture.  The fluctuating profitability metrics highlight potential instability and increased risk.  A long-term investment in UPS carries a substantial risk of underperforming the market.


**8. Recommendation:**

Based on the limited data, a long-term investment in UPS carries considerable risk relative to the S&P 500.  More research, including a deep dive into the latest earnings report, recent news, analyst forecasts, and a broader industry comparison, is highly recommended before any investment decision.  The current data does not support a bullish outlook.
