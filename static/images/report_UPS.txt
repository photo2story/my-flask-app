The cumulative return for UPS is 27.16%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 119.94%.  The difference is -92.8%, indicating UPS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.

This highlights the volatility inherent in UPS's stock performance and its sensitivity to macroeconomic factors.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $129.77

The price is below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it sits above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating potential support levels. The recent price change reflects a decrease of $1.21 from the previous close.

* **PPO:** 0.75 – Positive value, indicating bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +2.0 – Shows a short-term upward trend in relative performance.

The substantial negative change in the closing price (-$1.21) does highlight a short-term downward movement; it doesn't, however, completely invalidate the longer-term trends indicated by the moving averages and other indicators.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue, although there's a slight dip in Q3 2024 compared to Q4 2023. This may be a cyclical or seasonal fluctuation and warrants further investigation before drawing conclusions.  The provided data contains duplicate entries for 2024-11-06.  To perform a proper analysis, you need to clarify these duplicated entries.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has generally been increasing, though there's some variability quarter-to-quarter. Profit margins have shown some fluctuation, ranging from 15.43% to 19.34% during the timeframe.  The significant drop in profit margin in Q3 2024 (compared to Q4 2023) should be investigated.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown modest fluctuations. ROE has been generally stable between 6.58% and 9.27%,  again with a significant dip in Q3 2024. These metrics should be evaluated against industry benchmarks and UPS's historical trends to ascertain their significance.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period.  While recent earnings show growth trends, the considerable volatility in CAGR, combined with the relatively high RSI and significantly negative expected return, raises concerns about the long-term prospects of the stock relative to the S&P 500.  The recent price decline reinforces these concerns.  Further investigation into the reasons for the Q3 2024 profit margin and ROE decreases is crucial.  Investors should consider these factors carefully before making any investment decisions.  The data provided suggests significant risk, potentially outweighing any potential reward relative to the broader market.
