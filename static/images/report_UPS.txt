* **5-Day Moving Average:** $117.02

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +6.6 –  Indicates short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** -73.6% –  This strongly negative long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises serious concerns about future investment potential.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

UPS shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  While recent earnings indicate some positive growth, several red flags exist.  The negative expected return, overbought RSI, and downward trends in key financial metrics suggest caution.

More historical data is needed for a comprehensive analysis.  Currently, the data paints a bearish outlook for UPS.
