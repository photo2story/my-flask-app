UPS currently presents a mixed picture. While its long-term growth potential remains possible, particularly given the projections of the expected return (though highly uncertain), the recent underperformance against the S&P 500 and negative recent trends in price and some financial metrics are cause for concern.  The conflicting technical indicators suggest uncertainty regarding short-term direction.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and a clearer picture of the earnings trend are necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility demonstrated in the historical data suggests a need for careful risk management.
