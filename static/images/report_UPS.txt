The cumulative return of UPS over the reviewed period is 26.44%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 52.12%.  Therefore, UPS underperformed the S&P 500 by **25.68%** (52.12% - 26.44%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance over different periods, with both positive and negative CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures.  The alpha consistently shows a positive small value  (0.1) suggesting a slight outperformance compared to the market, however this needs to be considered in light of the negative CAGR figures shown in some periods.  The beta fluctuates around 1, indicating a similar level of volatility to the market.  However, the substantial negative CAGR values should be noted and investigated further. The Market Capitalization (Cap(B)) shows fluctuations but generally remains substantial.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $133.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $132.36
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $127.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $129.66

The price is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, the recent closing price is slightly below the previous close, indicating a minor downward correction.  The relatively close proximity of the 5-day and the other averages shows little significant short-term momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 74.76  - This suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory, indicating a potential short-term correction.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.87 - A positive value suggests upward momentum, aligning somewhat with the price being above moving averages.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change:** -0.9 - Indicates a recent weakening of relative strength.
* **Price Change:** The recent negative price change of -$0.43 indicates a slight downward correction which would not normally be described as a 'sharp' decline.

The expected return of 789.1% is extremely high and requires further scrutiny regarding its calculation and assumptions. Such a high return is unlikely and needs considerable justification.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue          |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| 2024-11-06 | $1.80   | $22.25 Billion   |
| 2024-08-07 | $1.65   | $21.82 Billion   |

| 2024-11-06 | $1.31   | $21.06 Billion   |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-11-06. Assuming this is an error and using only the first entry, EPS shows a clear upward trend over the last four quarters, and revenue also demonstrates growth. Further investigation is needed to determine whether the reported 2024-11-06 value is accurate.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500. While earnings show recent improvement and generally healthy financial metrics, the high RSI suggests potential overvaluation in the short term. The projected long-term return of 789.1% is unrealistic and requires further investigation.  The inconsistency in historical CAGR and the significant underperformance compared to the S&P500 should prompt further scrutiny of the business's prospects.  Careful consideration should be given to the underlying assumptions used in calculating this high expected return.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence, including an assessment of the macro-economic environment and future forecasts for UPS, is crucial.  The recent downward correction is a warning that the market might be assessing UPS as overvalued.
