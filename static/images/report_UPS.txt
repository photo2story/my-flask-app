| 2019-2021  | 100.0%| 11.7% | 27.0% | -0.4  | 160.1  | Extremely High CAGR, negatively correlated |
| 2020-2022  | 58.0% | 17.0% | 47.0% | -0.4  | 134.2  | High CAGR, negatively correlated to market |
| 2021-2023  | -9.0% | 17.0% | 0.8   | 126.2  |                    | Negative CAGR, higher beta              |
| 2022-2024  | -73.0%| 49.9% | 0.9   | 106.1  |                    | Extremely negative CAGR, higher beta      |
| 2023-2025  | -70.0%| 53.3% | 1.2   | 93.2   |                    | Extremely negative CAGR, higher beta      |


The significant negative CAGR in recent years (2022-2025) and high MDD indicate substantial risk and underperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $109.28
* **Last Market Price:** $110.01
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $110.19
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $115.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $118.49

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent slight increase ($0.69) from the previous close might signal a minor short-term rebound, but further observation is needed.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 32.84 (Oversold territory, potentially signaling a bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.65 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.8 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -57.8% (Significant negative expected return compared to S&P 500 over the long term)

The conflicting signals (oversold RSI, negative PPO) require cautious interpretation. The high negative expected return highlights the substantial risk involved.  The recent small price increase should be viewed within the context of the overall downtrend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period reviewed, exhibiting high risk and negative expected returns. While some short-term indicators suggest a potential bounce (oversold RSI), the overall trend is bearish, supported by negative PPO and substantial negative CAGR.  Earnings show mixed results, and financial health appears relatively stable.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the underperformance –  macroeconomic factors, industry competition, or internal company issues – is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Given the significant negative expected return, long-term investment in UPS should be approached with extreme caution.  Further investigation into the data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) is also recommended.
