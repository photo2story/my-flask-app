## United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**

This report analyzes United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), a global package delivery and supply chain management company, based on the provided data.  We will assess its performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), examine recent price movements, key indicators, earnings, and financial information to offer a comprehensive overview.


**1) Performance vs. S&P 500:**

UPS's cumulative return of 18.28% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's 87.98% cumulative return.  The provided data shows a large negative divergence (-69.7%), placing it at the 1.8th percentile of its historical range of divergence against the S&P 500 (-72.1% to 62.1%). This indicates a considerable underperformance compared to the broader market.

The provided CAGR and Alpha/Beta analysis indicates varying performance across different time periods. While some periods show positive Alpha (outperformance relative to the market), particularly between 2019 and 2022, recent periods show negative CAGR and a declining Alpha, highlighting the recent underperformance. The Beta consistently around 0.7-1.6 shows the stock's volatility is somewhat less than the market in the past but has reduced in recent times.  Market cap has grown, indicating expansion even with recent price declines.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $96.95
* **Last Market Price:** $95.89 (a decrease of $1.09)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $95.34
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $96.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $107.65

The last market price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short-term. The significant difference between the current price and the 60-day moving average signals a notable price drop within the past two months.


**3) Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 51.77 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.51 (Positive; suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.8 (Short-term upward trend, but this is overshadowed by the longer-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 520.6% (This is extremely high and requires careful scrutiny.  Itâ€™s likely based on a specific model and assumptions not presented here, making its reliability questionable.)

The recent price drop of $1.09 is a notable but not drastically significant decline, and does not indicate a *sudden* large drop.  The conflicting signals (positive PPO, negative price trend, and high expected return) require further investigation to ascertain the underlying causes and ensure accuracy.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-05-07 | 1.4  | $21.55B       |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.8  | $22.25B       |
| 2024-08-07 | 1.65 | $21.82B       |
| 2024-05-03 | 1.3  | $21.71B       |
| 2025-05-07 | 1.3  | $21.71B       |

There appears to be a duplication of data for May 7, 2025.  Excluding this duplication, recent earnings show some volatility.  While revenue has remained relatively stable, EPS fluctuates, indicating potential challenges in profitability.  A more thorough analysis is needed to determine the trends and factors influencing this variability.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $21.55B       | 17.08%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $25.30B       | 20.79%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $22.25B       | 16.69%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $21.82B       | 17.43%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.71B       | 16.50%        |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity       | ROE           |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $15.66B       | 7.58%         |
| 2024-12-31 | $16.72B       | 10.29%        |

| 2024-06-30 | $17.03B       | 8.27%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.91B       | 6.58%         |

Both revenue and profit margins show some fluctuation, with a notable increase in revenue and profit margin in Q4 2024.  Equity has generally decreased over the past year, and ROE has fluctuated, indicating potential areas for further analysis concerning profitability and capital management.



**6) Overall Analysis:**

UPS's recent performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While historical data shows periods of outperformance, recent trends indicate underperformance.  The current price is below key moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  While some indicators like PPO suggest bullish momentum, the overall picture is mixed and requires deeper investigation.  Earnings show some volatility, and financial information reveals fluctuations in revenue, profit margins, and ROE.  The extremely high projected return needs additional justification and should be viewed with caution.  Further investigation into the macroeconomic environment, competitive landscape, and specific company news is required for a more comprehensive and robust analysis.  The data provided exhibits inconsistencies (duplicate entry) necessitating data cleaning and validation before drawing definitive conclusions.
