2025-01-22 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) based on the provided data, presented as a report.

**United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Investment Review**

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO)**

United Parcel Service Inc. is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.

The provided data shows UPS's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns is a substantial -94.1%. While the relative divergence of -94.1% suggests underperformance compared to the S&P 500, it's crucial to consider the context of the historical range (-102.8% to 40.8%).  The 6.1% relative divergence indicates UPS's performance is closer to the historical minimum than the maximum.  Further investigation is needed to ascertain the reasons for this underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement**

As of the last reported data point, UPS's closing price was $132.87.  Recent price movements show:

* **5-day moving average:** $129.17
* **20-day moving average:** $126.10
* **60-day moving average:** $129.71

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the recent change of +2.42 from the previous close indicates a minor positive shift.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

* **RSI (66.62):**  Indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (0.7966):** A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, but the magnitude is relatively low.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-0.3):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (-64.8%):** This alarmingly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) raises serious concerns about the investment's potential.  This requires careful scrutiny and further investigation into the underlying assumptions. The significant price change of +$2.42 from the previous close does not offset this negative outlook.
