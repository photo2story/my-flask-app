*   **Analysis:**  The table reveals declining CAGR, very high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values, and consistently negative Alpha in recent periods, especially in the last few years. Beta has fluctuated. This suggests UPS's risk-adjusted returns have been poor, and it has delivered returns below what would be expected given its market exposure. The negative Alphas indicate significant underperformance relative to the market, and the high MDD values show large potential losses.

    *   The very negative Expected Return is a major red flag, indicating that the model projects continued underperformance relative to the S&P 500 even with consistent dollar-cost averaging.

**7. Overall Summary**

UPS is currently underperforming the broader market significantly. While technical indicators offer mixed signals (approaching overbought conditions, high MRI, but negative expected return), analyst opinions are generally positive with a "Buy" consensus. Financial performance (revenue, profit margins, and ROE) shows some volatility and a slight downward trend in key metrics.

**Recommendation:**

The conflicting signals make a clear recommendation challenging.  The negative Expected Return and significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 should be a major concern. While analysts are generally positive, this may already be factored into their price targets. A deeper dive into the reasons for the underperformance (e.g., changing competitive landscape, labor costs, etc.) is warranted before considering a long-term investment. Due to the underperformance and negative expected return, a HOLD or even a SELL recommendation might be more appropriate unless there is a strong conviction in a future turnaround.
