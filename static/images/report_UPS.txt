UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, and its relative divergence is near its historical low. Recent financial performance shows a decline in revenue and profit margin.

While UPS has some positive aspects (analyst ratings, dividend, recent price bounce), the underperformance, negative long-term outlook, and mixed financial results suggest caution. The significant divergence from the S&P 500 warrants further investigation into the specific factors driving this underperformance and whether a turnaround is likely. The conflicting signals from the technical analysis would mean further investigation is needed.
