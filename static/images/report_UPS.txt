## United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  As of the latest data point, UPS's cumulative return is 32.44%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which shows a 128.86% cumulative return.  This results in a current divergence of -96.4%, placing it at the 4.4th percentile of its historical range of divergence (-102.6% to 38.0%).  The provided alpha values (between 1.3 and 1.7) suggest that UPS has historically outperformed the market (beta >1) but this is not reflected in the recent cumulative return.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is highly variable year-to-year, indicating significant volatility in performance.  Maximum drawdown (MDD) also varies significantly, underscoring the risk involved with investing in UPS.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $135.68
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $134.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $132.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $131.18

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 56.12 – Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions; the market is relatively neutral.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.3 – A positive value indicates a bullish momentum, albeit a relatively weak one.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.6 – Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% –  The provided expected return of 0% suggests that, based on current analysis, there is no significant projected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment.  This needs further analysis considering the low cumulative return compared to the market.
* **Last Market vs Closing Price:** The slight difference between the last market price ($135.69) and closing price ($135.68) is insignificant and doesn't suggest any major market events like a sharp rebound or drop.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows a generally upward trend in both EPS and revenue, although there's some fluctuation.  The most recent EPS (1.8) shows an increase compared to previous quarters.  However, to assess performance completely, a comparison to analyst expectations for the 2024-11-06 report is necessary, which is missing from the provided data.


**5. Financial Information Analysis (Revenue & Profitability and Capital & Profitability):**

The Revenue and Profitability data indicates some fluctuation in profit margins (15.43% to 19.34%).  The most recent quarter shows a decline in both revenue and profit margin compared to the preceding quarter. A thorough analysis requires investigation into the reasons behind this fluctuation. Capital and Profitability data also shows fluctuations in both Equity and ROE, indicating potential shifts in the company's financial health and operational efficiency.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers behind these changes.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:** The prompt requests analysis of news within the last two days, including earnings reports and analyst opinions. This information is not provided and is crucial for a complete assessment.  Sources like Shacknews and Finbold should be checked for relevant news and analyst ratings.  A thorough search for recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights is necessary.

**7.  Comprehensive Analysis:**

UPS has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly in recent cumulative returns, despite showing periods of outperformance based on historical alpha values.  Current technical indicators suggest a relatively neutral market sentiment, with some short-term positive momentum.  Financial performance data shows some volatility, and a comprehensive analysis needs clarification about the 2024-11-06 earnings report and comparison to expectations.  Crucially missing is recent news and analyst opinion which would significantly improve the accuracy of this analysis. The 0% expected return warrants a deeper investigation into the underlying assumptions.


**8. Conclusion:**

This analysis provides a partial overview of UPS's performance.  The lack of crucial data, particularly recent news, analyst opinions, and comparison of the most recent earnings to expectations, severely limits the robustness of the conclusions. A more in-depth analysis involving the missing information is necessary to provide a comprehensive and well-informed investment recommendation.
