## United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:**

UPS, a global package delivery and supply chain management company, has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While exhibiting periods of strong growth, recent performance shows considerable decline, reflected in negative cumulative returns and concerning financial indicators.  Further analysis is needed to determine the long-term viability and investment potential.


**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **Company Overview:** United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global leader in package delivery and supply chain management.

* **Cumulative Returns:**
    * UPS: -0.905241099212628 (or -90.52%)
    * S&P 500 (VOO): 89.4374096246338 (or 89.44%)
    * **Return Difference:**  -180% approximately (The S&P 500 outperformed UPS by approximately 180 percentage points.)

* **Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows highly volatile Alpha and Beta values, indicating inconsistent performance relative to the market. While showing periods of positive alpha (outperformance), recent years display negative alpha and high beta suggesting high market sensitivity and underperformance. The high and fluctuating MDD (Maximum Drawdown) emphasizes the risk associated with UPS stock.  Capitalization remains relatively stable but fluctuates based on the market condition.



**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $109.28
* **5-day Moving Average:** $110.19
* **20-day Moving Average:** $115.43
* **60-day Moving Average:** $118.49

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price drop of $0.65 from the previous close indicates a short-term negative trend.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4403 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 32.84 (Suggests oversold conditions, but not necessarily a strong buy signal alone)
* **PPO:** -0.6503 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.8 (Short-term upward movement, but this is minor given the larger context)
* **Expected Return:** -57.8% (This is a very negative outlook for the next 2 years and needs further justification. Given that this is stated as a S&P 500 relative return, such an extreme underperformance would need considerable explanation and is likely unrealistic without specific modelling assumptions.)  The large negative price change is a significant factor contributing to this negative outlook.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue        |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.8  | $22.25 B       |

| 2024-11-06 | 1.31 | $21.06 B       | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


**Analysis:** EPS shows an upward trend. However, revenue shows a slight decrease from Q4 2023 to Q2 2024 before recovering in Q3 2024. The duplication in the data needs clarification.

**Analysis:** Revenue shows some volatility but an overall upward trend.  Profit margins show some fluctuation but remain generally healthy. ROE shows a slight downward trend.


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

UPS's recent performance has been significantly weak compared to the S&P 500.  While earnings show some positive signs, the overall picture is bearish, indicated by negative cumulative returns, price movement below moving averages, and concerning technical indicators. The predicted -57.8% expected return is exceptionally low and likely needs further clarification and more robust methodology.   The high volatility and potential for significant drawdowns should be considered.  More detailed fundamental analysis, including competitive landscape, future growth projections, and macroeconomic factors, is necessary before forming a conclusive investment opinion.  The data presented raises significant concerns about UPS's current investment potential.
