## United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.

The cumulative return for UPS is 26.44%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's cumulative return of 122.16%.  The provided data shows a difference of -95.7%, placing it in the 4.9th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates UPS has substantially underperformed the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) figures show high volatility in UPS's performance over the years, ranging from substantial gains to significant losses. The consistently low or zero alpha suggests UPS has not generated significant returns beyond what would be expected based on its beta (market risk). The beta itself fluctuates considerably, highlighting exposure to market risks.  Note that a beta of 0.0 is unlikely realistic and could suggest an issue with the data provided.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $133.03
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $132.36

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $129.66

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a more mixed longer-term trend. The recent price change shows a small decline (-0.43%).


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -2.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -89.1% (This indicates a significantly lower projected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This is a concerningly negative outlook).

The recent price drop is relatively small and doesn't indicate a significant event.  The negative expected return highlights a significant risk associated with UPS relative to the S&P 500.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS's performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. While recent earnings show some positive momentum in EPS, the substantial negative projected return compared to the market, coupled with the relatively high RSI and the mixed price trends suggest caution. The provided data raises concerns regarding the accuracy and completeness of the alpha and beta calculations.  Further investigation is needed to determine the reliability of these metrics and the reasons for UPS's underperformance.  The provided data necessitates more in-depth analysis before forming a conclusive opinion on UPS's investment potential.  The -89.1% expected return relative to the S&P 500 presents a significant risk for long-term investment.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the underperformance relative to the broader market, questionable alpha/beta data, and the negative expected return, further due diligence is strongly recommended before considering an investment in UPS.  Independent verification of the provided data, along with a thorough examination of the company's long-term strategy, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors, is crucial.  Consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
