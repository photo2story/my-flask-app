**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:** The alpha is significantly negative in recent periods (2021-2025), indicating UPS is underperforming relative to what its beta would predict, suggesting factors beyond market movement are impacting the stock. A large negative alpha means the stock is generating significantly less return than expected based on its risk.
*   **Beta:** The beta fluctuates, but is positive recently, suggesting the stock's price movement is more correlated to the market and more sensitive to market volatility.
*   **CAGR:** The negative CAGR for recent periods (2021-2025) aligns with the significant underperformance against the S&P 500.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) indicate substantial peak-to-trough declines, meaning investors have experienced significant losses at times.

*   **60-day SMA:** 93.85

**Analysis:**  The current price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day SMAs, indicating a recent slight downward trend. However, it's significantly above the 60-day SMA, suggesting an overall longer-term upward trend despite the recent weakness.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 63.10
*   **PPO:** -0.32

*   **Expected Return (%):** -398.7%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A MRI of 0.9 suggests a medium investment recommendation.
*   **RSI:**  An RSI of 63.10 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), suggesting the stock might be due for a pullback.
*   **PPO:** A slightly negative PPO (-0.32) suggests that the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential slight downward trend or consolidation.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends using 90% of available cash to buy the stock, which suggests a buy recommendation.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** A negative change in relative divergence (-3.3) over the last 20 days indicates the underperformance against the S&P 500 is worsening.
*   **Expected Return:** A negative expected return of -398.7% is highly concerning, suggesting significant potential downside risk if invested for the long term. This is likely an outlier calculation and should be interpreted with extreme caution, as such a large negative expected return is not realistically sustainable.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Coverage:**  Several articles discuss whether UPS is a good buy at current prices ("Should You Buy UPS Stock While It's Below $105?") or whether a small investment could yield significant returns in the long run ("Could Investing $10,000 in United Parcel Service (UPS) Stock Make You a Millionaire?").
*   **Dividend Spotlight:**  An article highlights UPS's dividend yield ("UPS stock slips under $100 — and its 6.6% dividend is back in the spotlight"), which could be attractive to income-seeking investors.
*   **Future Outlook:**  An article speculates on where the stock price might be in a year ("Where Will UPS Stock Be in 1 Year?").
*   **Strategic Overhaul:** One article discusses UPS's strategic overhaul ("Navigating the Pivot: UPS’s Strategic Overhaul Under Scrutiny"), suggesting the company is undergoing significant changes that may impact its future performance.
*   **Other News:** Kroger's stock buyback is a somewhat irrelevant news item.

**Analysis:** The news coverage presents a mixed picture. While some articles suggest UPS could be a good investment opportunity, others focus on the company's challenges and strategic shifts.  The emphasis on the dividend yield suggests that the stock may be particularly appealing to investors looking for income.  The article about the strategic overhaul is particularly important, as it highlights the potential for significant change within the company.

*   **Target Price:** Average: 103.83, High: 122.00, Low: 75.00

**Analysis:**  The analyst consensus is generally positive ("Buy"), suggesting that analysts believe the stock has the potential to appreciate. The average target price of $103.83 indicates a potential upside from the current price of $99.64. However, there's a wide range in target prices (from $75 to $122), suggesting some uncertainty among analysts. Lack of recent rating changes is also a bit concerning.
