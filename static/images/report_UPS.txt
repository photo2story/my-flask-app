2025-12-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of UPS based on the provided data, broken down into sections for clarity.

**1) Return Rate Comparison: UPS vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global leader in logistics, offering a broad range of solutions including transporting packages and freight, facilitating international trade, and deploying advanced technology to manage the world of business more efficiently.

*   **Return Data:**
    *   UPS Cumulative Return: -7.22%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 100.88%
    *   Divergence: -108.1 (Relative Divergence: 10.3)

*   **Analysis:** UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The divergence of -108.1 indicates a large gap in cumulative returns. The relative divergence of 10.3 suggests this level of underperformance is closer to the minimum divergence seen in the tracked data. This means it's near the *best* of its recent relative underperformance, but still drastically behind the market.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    | Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |

    | 2023-2025  | -49.0% | 71.8%  | -115.0%  | 0.9    | 85.0   |

    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate has been volatile, ranging from -69% to 76% in the last few periods. Recent periods show significant negative growth.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant risk and potential losses.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative in the more recent periods. This means UPS has been underperforming its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis. The negative alpha signifies that the stock isn't generating excess returns relative to the risk taken.
    *   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates. A beta near 1 suggests volatility similar to the market. A beta less than 1 suggests less volatility than the market, and a beta greater than 1 suggests more volatility than the market. More recently, Beta has been positive (0.9 and 1.1), indicating that UPS's price moves are amplified compared to the market.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Cap has fluctuated.

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is slightly above its 5-day SMA, which is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This *could* suggest a short-term upward trend, but the negative change in the last market data (price decline) indicates there's immediate downward pressure.

    *   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests moderate risk.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI above 70 indicates the stock may be overbought, signaling a potential pullback.

    *   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** Indicates a short-term upward trend in the stock's performance relative to its comparison.
