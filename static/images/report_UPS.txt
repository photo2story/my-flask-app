## United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Relative Strength:**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  As of the latest data point, UPS's cumulative return is 34.26%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) at 128.31%.  The difference is -94.1%, placing it at the 6th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 (-102.6% to 38%). This indicates underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals consistently positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) but with significant variability across different periods, suggesting inconsistent outperformance.  The beta consistently above 1 illustrates UPS's higher volatility compared to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $137.54 (Last Market: $134.78)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $133.80
* **20-day Moving Average:** $132.36
* **60-day Moving Average:** $130.89

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The jump from the last market price to the closing price indicates a positive movement, though whether this is significant would depend on the context of prior price movements.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 61.67 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, remaining in a neutral territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.31 – A positive value indicates bullish momentum, though the magnitude is relatively small.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +2.4 – Indicates a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% –  This suggests that over a long-term (2+ years) horizon, with consistent investment, the stock is not expected to outperform the S&P 500 significantly.  This prediction needs further contextualization with the current market conditions and risk assessment. The jump from the last market close to the reported close ($134.78 to $137.54) does indicate a minor positive surge but it's not significant enough to label as a "sharp rebound".


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data show a generally upward trend in both metrics.  However, a more thorough analysis requires comparison to analyst estimates and industry benchmarks.  Note that the duplicated data point for 2024-11-06 needs clarification.  A comparison with expectations for the most recent earnings report is critical in determining whether the results were positive or negative surprises to the market.

**5. Financial Ratios (from provided data):**

The quarterly financial data show fluctuating profitability and return on equity (ROE). The profit margins show some variability, potentially reflecting seasonal changes or economic factors.  The ROE also shows fluctuations, indicating varying efficiency in utilizing shareholder equity. Further analysis is necessary to understand the trends and the underlying drivers behind these fluctuations.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  To provide an accurate analysis of recent news (within the last two days), including earnings news coverage from sources like Shacknews and analyst opinions from FINBOLD, this information is required.  The report needs these data points to comment on market outlook and any significant recent events affecting UPS.


**7.  Overall Analysis (Summary of points 1-6):**

UPS has shown mixed performance. While its revenue and earnings have generally increased, its stock performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook.  However, the low expected return and the need for more information on recent news and analyst opinions caution against significant bullish expectations.  A more comprehensive analysis requires complete financial data, detailed comparison to industry benchmarks, and current news and analyst sentiment to draw more conclusive insights.  The uncertainty regarding future performance warrants a careful consideration of risk tolerance before investing.
