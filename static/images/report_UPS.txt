*Analysis:*

*   **CAGR & MDD:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows strong growth in earlier periods but significant negative growth in recent years. MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates substantial risk, especially in the later periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is largely negative in recent periods, indicating underperformance relative to the benchmark. The large negative alpha in the most recent period (-142%) is particularly concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates significantly, even flipping from negative to positive, indicating inconsistent correlation with the market.  The most recent period shows a high beta (3.1), suggesting high sensitivity to market movements (potentially amplifying losses).
*   **Cap(B):** The market cap has decreased significantly in recent years, reflecting the negative performance.

*   **20-day Moving Average:** 86.976
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 94.502

*Analysis:*

*   The stock price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), indicating a downtrend. The "Last Market Data" shows a slight negative change, reinforcing the recent downward momentum.

**3. Indicators & Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.33 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 37.71 (Approaching oversold territory - generally below 30 is considered oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.128 (Positive but close to zero, indicating weak momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (2 shares - Caution - MRI:0.34)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 0.7 (+): Short-term Increase
*   **Expected Return:** -499.1% (Significant underperformance vs. S&P 500, long-term)

*Analysis:*

*   The RSI suggests the stock is nearing oversold conditions, potentially indicating a possible short-term bounce.
*   The PPO, while positive, is weak.
*   Despite the low MRI indicating low risk, the Hybrid Signal suggests caution.
*   The recent relative divergence increase indicates that, in the very short term, UPS may be recovering slightly relative to the S&P 500.
*   The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting a very pessimistic long-term outlook based on the data. The sharp price drop reflected in "Last Market Data" reinforces current negative sentiment.

**7. 종합 Conclusion:**

UPS is currently facing significant challenges. It is underperforming the S&P 500, and key financial metrics like revenue, EPS, and ROE are showing a downward trend.  While analyst consensus remains a "Buy," recent price target cuts and negative news flow suggest a weakening conviction in the company's near-term prospects. Technical indicators suggest the stock may be nearing oversold conditions, potentially leading to a short-term bounce. However, the extremely negative long-term expected return is a major concern. The high Beta in the 2023-2025 period and recent relative divergence change suggests that, in the very short term, UPS may be recovering slightly relative to the S&P 500.

**Recommendation:** Given the totality of the data, a cautious approach is warranted. While a contrarian argument could be made based on potential undervaluation, the negative trends in financial performance and negative expectations outweigh the positive analyst sentiment. Further research is needed to understand the underlying causes of the underperformance and assess the potential for a turnaround. The Hybrid Signal supports a "Caution" outlook.
