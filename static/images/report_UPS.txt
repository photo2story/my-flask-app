## United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  The cumulative return of UPS is 22.34%, significantly lagging the S&P 500 (VOO) return of 121.78%. The difference is -99.4%, placing it at the 2.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $128.55
* **5-day Moving Average:** $129.13
* **20-day Moving Average:** $131.52
* **60-day Moving Average:** $131.61

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (27.22):** Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible, but not guaranteed.
* **PPO (-0.28):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (-0.5):** Shows a recent decrease in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The model projects no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) at this time.  Given the current price of $128.55 and the negative outlook, a significant price increase is not anticipated without significant changes in the fundamental and macro environments.  Any sharp movements upward would likely be short-lived rallies.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a mixed picture:

* **EPS:** EPS has generally increased from Q1 2024 to Q3 2024, showing a trend of growth.  However, there is some inconsistency in the reporting, with a duplicate entry for Nov 6, 2024.
* **Revenue:** Revenue has shown modest growth over the past few quarters.  There is a significant jump between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 however. This is inconsistent and needs further investigation to determine the cause of this change.  Without further details, any analysis would be speculative.
* **Significant Changes:**  The duplicate entry needs clarification.  The comparison between quarters is difficult without consistent and accurate data.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates, and profit margins have been inconsistent, with a notable decrease in Q4 2023 and increase in Q2 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity and ROE have shown fluctuation, suggesting volatility in the company's profitability.  There is a drop in equity in Q3 2024.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions are provided within the given data.  To provide a thorough analysis, information regarding recent news, market outlook, and analyst sentiment is required.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but the negative PPO and declining relative divergence point to continued bearish momentum.  Earnings show some growth, but inconsistencies in the data require clarification.  Financial information reveals fluctuation in profitability and equity.  Without additional context (news, analyst opinions, market outlook, and corrected financial data), a definitive conclusion regarding UPS's future performance is not possible. Further investigation is necessary to fully assess the situation.

**8. Recommendation:**

Based solely on the provided, incomplete data, a long-term investment in UPS at this time carries considerable risk, given its significant underperformance relative to the market and inconsistent financial data.  More detailed analysis, including complete and accurate financial statements and current market analysis, is crucial before making an informed investment decision.
