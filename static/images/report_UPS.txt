    **Analysis:** UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period studied. The large negative divergence (-108.7) highlights this. Looking at the Alpha/Beta analysis, it's clear that UPS has struggled in recent years. Alpha, which measures excess return relative to the market, is negative for many periods, particularly the most recent ones. Beta has fluctuated. This indicates the stock's volatility relative to the market has changed over time. Also, note that the CAGR has been recently negative and the MDD is high, showing recent volatility.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 102.08
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 102.08, Previous Close: 100.96, Change: 1.11
*   **5-day SMA:** 100.83
*   **20-day SMA:** 97.13
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.96

    **Analysis:** The stock is trading above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), which suggests a short-term upward trend. The relatively large change from the previous close could indicate some increased volatility or a recent catalyst.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 69.87
*   **PPO:** 0.33
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (3 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 2.5 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -308.3%

    **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI:** A MRI of 0.7 suggests that the market views UPS as a medium risk investment at the moment.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 69.87 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), which *could* suggest a potential pullback in the near term. However, RSI is not a perfect indicator and should be used in conjunction with other signals.
    *   **PPO:** A positive PPO suggests the short-term moving average is above the long-term moving average, indicating potential upward momentum, but the value (0.33) is relatively low.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The algorithm suggests buying 90% of available cash, indicating a moderately bullish stance but considers the investment as safe, as well.
    *   **Expected Return:** A *very* negative expected return (-308.3%) is concerning and indicates that, based on the model's calculations, UPS is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term.
