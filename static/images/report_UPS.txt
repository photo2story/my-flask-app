**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered, showing substantial negative alpha and high beta recently.  Technical indicators point to a bearish sentiment (negative PPO, price below moving averages, relatively low RSI). While recent earnings show some positive EPS movement, revenue growth is inconsistent and profit margins have fluctuated.  The financial data indicates some weakness in profitability and equity. The extremely negative expected return (-529.1%) requires significant clarification regarding its calculation.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough review of the -529.1% expected return calculation methodology is crucial, and further investigation into the underlying factors contributing to UPS's underperformance is needed.  The current data suggests a cautious approach to investment in UPS.
