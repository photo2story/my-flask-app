* **20-day Moving Average:** $124.02
* **60-day Moving Average:** $127.28

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (22.28):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible, but it's not a reliable buy signal alone.

* **PPO (-1.31):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.

* **Relative Strength (20-day change):**  A positive change (+1.1) suggests short-term upward momentum, but it needs to be viewed in context of the larger downtrend.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:**  Short-term upward trend.

* **Expected Return (-498.6%):** This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a major red flag.  It highlights the significant underperformance and substantial risk involved.  The current price change (0.93%) is small in relation to the drastic overall expected return, so it does not indicate a major shift in long term expectations.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

UPS currently presents a concerning picture.  While recent earnings show some improvement, the stock has severely underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. Negative technical indicators (RSI, PPO), a dramatically negative long-term expected return, and inconsistencies in the provided data all raise significant questions.  The substantial divergence between UPS and the broader market suggests underlying issues that need to be addressed before considering any long-term investment.  More detailed fundamental analysis, including examination of the company's competitive landscape, industry trends, and potential future growth prospects, is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.  The data provided reveals significant risks.
