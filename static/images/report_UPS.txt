*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown remains high across all periods, indicating significant volatility and risk.

*   **Beta:** Beta has fluctuated, but in recent periods (2021-2025), it has been closer to 1, indicating UPS's price movements are becoming more correlated with the overall market.

*   **60-day SMA:** 93.404

**Analysis:**

UPS's stock price is currently hovering around $100.54. The 5-day SMA is slightly above the 20-day SMA, which in turn is above the 60-day SMA.  This indicates a short-term upward trend, as the shorter moving averages are higher than the longer-term averages. However, the negative change from the previous close suggests slight selling pressure in the most recent trading day.

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 74.89 (Approaching overbought territory)

*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (3 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.4 (+): Short-term rise
*   **Expected Return (%):** -302.1 (Significant underperformance expected compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The high MRI suggests that from a purely *market risk* perspective, investment is recommended. However, this must be weighed against other factors.
*   The RSI of 74.89 is approaching the overbought threshold (typically 70), suggesting the stock may be due for a pullback.
*   The negative PPO indicates that the shorter-term moving average is below the longer-term moving average, signaling a potential downtrend (though small PPO value suggests its bottoming out)
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a Buy signal, using 90% of cash reserves to purchase 3 shares. This signal is considered "Safe" and reflects an MRI of 0.80 in the recommendation.
*   The short-term rise in relative divergence over the past 20 days indicates positive momentum.
*   The extremely negative Expected Return is a significant red flag. It suggests that, based on current trends, UPS is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the next two years.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

UPS is facing significant challenges. While analysts maintain a "Buy" rating, the underlying data paints a more concerning picture. The company is underperforming the market substantially, experiencing declining revenue and profit margins, and facing uncertainty due to layoffs and questions surrounding its dividend. The negative expected return suggests continued underperformance relative to the S&P 500. The short-term positive momentum in stock price and the "Safe" Buy signal should be interpreted with caution, as they might be transient fluctuations within a larger downtrend. Investors should carefully consider the risks before investing in UPS.
