| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2016-2018  | 3.0% | 15.4% | -15.0% | 0.4 | 67.7 |

| 2018-2020  | 44.0% | 15.4% | 17.0% | -0.6 | 124.9 |
| 2019-2021  | 102.0% | 10.4% | 31.0% | -0.7 | 162.4 |
| 2020-2022  | 59.0% | 16.4% | 50.0% | -0.7 | 136.1 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $114.53
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $113.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $123.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $127.05

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent slight increase (+$0.32) from the previous close is not significant enough to reverse this overall trend.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (23.34):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce but not necessarily a sustained uptrend.
* **PPO (-1.05):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+1.4):** Short-term upward movement, but this needs to be considered in the context of the longer-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (-435.2%):** This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term raises serious concerns about the investment's viability.  This figure likely reflects the significant underperformance observed historically.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.8   | $22.25 B       |
| 2024-08-07 | 1.65  | $21.82 B       |
| 2024-05-03 | 1.3   | $21.71 B       |
| 2023-11-01 | 1.31  | $21.06 B       |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.31  | $21.06 B       | *(There's a duplicate entry here.  Data needs verification.)*


Earnings show a recent increase in EPS and revenue, but this needs to be viewed cautiously alongside the negative stock performance and other indicators. The repeated entry for November 6th, 2024 requires clarification.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $22.25B    | 16.69%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $21.82B    | 17.43%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.71B    | 16.50%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $24.92B    | 19.34%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $21.06B    | 15.43%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE    |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| 2024-09-30 | $16.86B    | 9.13%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $17.03B    | 8.27%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $16.91B    | 6.58%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $17.31B    | 9.27%  |
| 2023-09-30 | $19.17B    | 5.88%  |

Revenue has fluctuated, and profit margins have generally decreased recently.  Similarly, equity and ROE show some volatility but overall are relatively stable.  The financial information does not fully explain the dramatic underperformance in the stock price.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

UPS is currently exhibiting significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While recent earnings show some improvement, this is not reflected in the stock price. Technical indicators point to an oversold condition, but the strong negative expected return and persistent bearish momentum raise serious concerns.  The discrepancy between relatively stable financials and the deeply negative stock performance requires further investigation into factors not captured in this data, such as macroeconomic conditions impacting the shipping industry, company-specific challenges, and investor sentiment.  The extremely negative long-term expected return (-435.2%) suggests this stock may not be a suitable investment at this time, especially compared to the S&P 500.  Further due diligence and analysis are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  Consider investigating the reasons behind the large negative alpha and the significantly negative CAGR reported for 2022-2025.
