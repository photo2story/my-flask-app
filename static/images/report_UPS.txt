**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (36.38):**  Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.32):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** A positive change indicates short-term upward momentum. However, this is countered by the negative PPO and low RSI.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The model projects no significant excess return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), reinforcing the underperformance observed so far.  This should be considered cautiously, as it is a projection, not a guarantee.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows:

* **Revenue:** Revenue growth has been somewhat inconsistent, with a decline from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024, followed by modest increases in subsequent quarters.
* **EPS:** EPS has generally trended upwards but is not showing strong growth. The increase from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024 is notably stronger than increases in previous quarters.
* **Comparison:** There are two entries for 2024-11-06. One might be an error. If we consider only unique dates, there is a clear trend of increasing EPS and revenue on a quarter-over-quarter basis.  Without comparative expectations, it's impossible to assess whether results were "beats" or "misses."

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates, with a noticeable drop in Q4 2023, followed by slight increases. Profit margins have been generally stable but slightly decreased in recent quarters.

This section requires up-to-date information from news sources and financial websites covering UPS.  The prompt doesn't provide this data.  To complete this section, review recent news articles for announcements impacting UPS' stock price.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years. While recent quarterly results show growth in EPS and Revenue, the overall trend isn't overwhelmingly positive, and the company is facing market headwinds. The RSI suggests oversold conditions, suggesting potential short-term upside, but the PPO and long-term projections indicate a bearish outlook.  Further research into the news, sector-specific influences, and management commentary is needed for a complete picture.  The 0% expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term suggests that while a short term bounce is possible, long-term investment should be carefully considered given its recent past performance.
