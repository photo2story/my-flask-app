**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has shown a mixed performance.  While revenue and EPS demonstrate growth, the company has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in the past. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook, but long-term prospects appear uncertain given the provided 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500. The company's fluctuating profitability and relatively high volatility (Beta > 1) present risks for investors. A thorough review of recent news, analyst opinions, and a more detailed analysis of the company's future prospects are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current data set offers limited insight into the underlying reasons for the company's relative underperformance.
