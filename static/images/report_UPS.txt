**Analysis:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:** UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, as indicated by the negative cumulative return and large negative divergence.
*   **Alpha Issues:** The negative Alpha values in most periods indicate UPS consistently underperformed relative to its risk (Beta).  The negative alpha are getting more and more severe recently.

*   **High MDD:** The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values suggest significant potential losses for investors during the periods observed.
*   **CAGR Variation:** CAGR shows periods of strong growth followed by recent periods of steep decline.
*   **Capitalization:** Market capitalization (Cap) has fluctuated, but generally decreased over the more recent periods.

*   **5-day SMA:** 94.84
*   **20-day SMA:** 94.36

*   The 60-day SMA is significantly lower, indicating a longer-term upward trend.
*   The small price change from the previous close indicates relatively stable price action recently, but it doesn't reflect the magnitude of any intra-day fluctuations.

**3) RSI, PPO, MRI, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 49.57 (Neutral)

*   **Expected Return:** -285.1%

**Analysis:**

*   **Conflicting Signals:** The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests a "High Investment Recommended" rating, which is highly unusual given the negative performance. This is likely due to the algorithm used, and should be interpreted with caution.
*   **Neutral RSI:** The RSI is near 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **Slightly Bearish PPO:** The negative PPO suggests a slight downward trend in price momentum.
*   **Short Term Optimism:** Recent Divergence Change suggests short-term upward movement.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return indicates that the model predicts further significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.

While analyst opinions are generally positive, news headlines indicate mixed sentiment and concerns about the dividend's sustainability.
