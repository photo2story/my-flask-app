## United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

UPS, a global package delivery and supply chain management company, shows significantly underperformance against the S&P 500 (VOO) over the reviewed period.  While specific timeframes aren't provided, the cumulative return is drastically lower than the benchmark.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons for this underperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return:** UPS: 5.98%, VOO: 71.02%  This indicates a substantial underperformance of UPS compared to the S&P 500. The difference is -65.0%, placing it at the 17.1 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided max and min divergence).

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows significant volatility in UPS's performance relative to the market (Beta) and inconsistent alpha (outperformance relative to the market). High positive alphas in some years are counterbalanced by large negative alphas in others, suggesting a lack of consistent market-beating returns. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates but generally shows growth over the observed period.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values across different periods also highlight the significant risk associated with investing in UPS.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $97.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $105.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $112.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $117.50

The price is significantly below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The recent price drop of $2.41 (from $100.12) reinforces this bearish signal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk) – This suggests a high level of risk associated with the stock.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 13.67 – This is extremely low, indicating oversold conditions and potential for a bounce. However, it doesn't guarantee a price increase.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.39 – This negative value confirms the bearish trend.
* **Relative Divergence:**  A recent 10.6% increase in the relative divergence indicates a short-term upward trend in relative performance; however, this relative improvement is still within an overall bearish context.
* **Expected Return:** -36.6% – This indicates a substantial projected loss. This negative expected return and the overall analysis suggest a high risk investment, even for a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy.  A long-term investment may yield eventual returns exceeding the S&P 500, but the probability of such an outcome under the current circumstances appears low.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue        |
|------------|------|----------------|

More data is needed for a thorough analysis.  Further investigation is necessary to ascertain the reason for the duplicate entry.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS currently exhibits a high-risk profile. While recent earnings show some positive signs, the stock's significant underperformance against the S&P 500, negative expected return, and low RSI suggest a bearish outlook.  The high Market Risk Indicator adds to the concern.  Despite the potential for a short-term bounce due to oversold conditions (low RSI), the long-term outlook appears uncertain, and a substantial recovery to outperform the S&P 500 seems unlikely based on the provided data.  Further due diligence, including a deeper fundamental analysis and consideration of external factors impacting the logistics industry, is highly recommended before any investment decisions are made.  The substantial negative expected return and high MDD figures raise significant cautionary flags.
