**1. Performance Comparison:**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  Over the measured period, UPS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), lagging by 57.5 percentage points.  The relative underperformance places UPS in the 8.1st percentile of its historical performance range compared to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta) and significant variation in Alpha (excess return compared to the market).  While some periods show high alpha and CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), others exhibit substantial negative returns and high maximum drawdown (MDD). This suggests high volatility and sensitivity to market conditions.  Note that the extremely negative CAGRs in the last two periods are probably unrealistic and may reflect data issues or other limitations.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4118 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 28.47 (Oversold; potentially indicating a bounce, but not a guarantee)

* **Expected Return (Long-Term, vs. S&P 500):** 125.3%  This high expected return needs further scrutiny. The basis for this figure should be clarified; it may reflect an overly optimistic scenario given the current performance and market conditions.

The significant price drop in the last day is a noticeable bearish signal.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows consistent revenue growth, but EPS growth appears inconsistent. Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of this discrepancy and the overall financial health of the company.  There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-11-06.

| Date       | EPS | Revenue       |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.8  | $22.25B       |
| 2024-08-07 | 1.65 | $21.82B       |
| 2024-05-03 | 1.3  | $21.71B       |
| 2023-11-01 | 1.31 | $21.06B       |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.31 | $21.06B       |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability, and Capital and Profitability tables show some volatility in recent quarters. Revenue is relatively stable with some seasonal fluctuations. Profit margins are generally consistent within the range of 16-20%. Return on Equity (ROE) also fluctuates.  More in-depth analysis is needed to understand the underlying trends and drivers of these figures.


| Quarter    | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $25.30B     | 20.79%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $22.25B     | 16.69%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $21.82B     | 17.43%        |

|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $16.72B     | 10.29%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $16.86B     | 9.13%         |
| 2024-06-30 | $17.03B     | 8.27%         |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  While there are periods of strong performance, volatility and inconsistent results are apparent.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, with the price currently trading below key moving averages and displaying oversold conditions (RSI).  The high projected long-term return requires justification and seems optimistic given current market conditions and recent performance.  Further investigation is needed to assess the sustainability of revenue growth and the reasons behind fluctuations in EPS and ROE.  The provided data presents a mixed picture, and a more thorough due diligence process is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Clarification on the source and methodology for some metrics (particularly the long-term expected return) is crucial.
