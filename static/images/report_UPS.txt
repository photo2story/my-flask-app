**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  The cumulative return of UPS is 18.25%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's cumulative return of 117.56%.  The difference is -99.3%, placing it at the 3.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.

The provided CAGR data shows significant variability in annual growth, ranging from a high of 102% to a low of -75%.  Alpha consistently remains at 0.0, suggesting the stock's performance is largely explained by market movements (Beta varies, indicating sensitivity to market fluctuations).  High maximum drawdown (MDD) figures highlight significant periods of risk.

* **Last Market Price:** $126.26
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $125.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $129.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $132.15

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The last market price of $126.26 doesn't indicate a significant jump or drop, given the context of the moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 39.78 (Suggests the stock may be oversold, but caution is warranted.)
* **PPO:** -0.33 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Relative Strength:** 1.1 (+), indicating recent short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests no expected alpha over the S&P 500 based on the provided data for long-term investment. This requires further investigation and context to accurately assess.)

The combination of low RSI and negative PPO along with being below all moving averages paints a bearish picture. The positive recent relative strength is a counterpoint and requires further investigation into why the relative strength indicator jumped recently.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals:

* **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue has generally increased quarter-over-quarter, although there's a decrease in Q4 2024 compared to Q3 2024.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS has shown a generally upward trend except for the slight dip in Q1 2024.  There's a repeating EPS figure of 1.31 which may be an error in data entry.
* **Significant Changes:**  The most significant change appears to be in the last quarter. While revenue is down from the previous quarter, the decrease is not significant. However, the EPS is higher. 

Without expectations data, it's impossible to assess whether the reported numbers beat or missed expectations.  The data needs to be corrected, with the duplicate Q4 2024 EPS entry removed.  The data presented does not support concluding whether a beat or miss has happened.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates, with a significant drop in the last quarter. Profit margins show some volatility and a downward trend in recent quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is somewhat volatile. ROE is also variable, exhibiting an overall downward trend.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which are not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period, displaying high volatility and significant drawdowns. While recent short-term momentum appears slightly positive, overall technical indicators and the recent trend suggest a bearish outlook.  Earnings show some variability, but without comparative expectations data it's hard to draw conclusive statements on performance.  More information is needed to make a comprehensive assessment, particularly regarding recent news and analyst sentiment. There is no evidence of a dramatic change in the recent movements in the price of UPS, and its movements largely follow the moving averages. The lack of alpha in its past performance indicates that the movements are strongly coupled with the market.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current data, a cautious approach is recommended. Further investigation is needed into recent news, analyst sentiment, and a detailed comparison of reported earnings versus expectations to gain a more complete picture of UPS's current standing and future prospects. The provided data does not currently suggest a strong buy recommendation. Further analysis is required to determine whether the stock is undervalued.
