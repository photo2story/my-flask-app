| 2023-2025  | -51.0%  | 71.8%   | -118.0% | 0.9    | 85.3   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** The CAGR has declined significantly in recent periods. Notice the dramatic drop from high positive values in 2019-2022 to negative values in the last three periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** The MDD is consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha, which measures performance relative to a benchmark, is largely negative in recent periods, suggesting UPS has been underperforming its benchmark. This underperformance has become more pronounced in the most recent periods.
*   **Beta:** Beta values have shifted. Earlier periods show negative or near-zero beta, indicating lower volatility or inverse correlation with the market. Recent periods show a Beta close to 1, reflecting the same systematic risk as the S\&P500.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** Market cap has fluctuated, showing a decline in the most recent period, potentially reflecting investor concerns about the company's performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 100.54
*   **Previous Close:** 100.66
*   **Change:** -0.12
*   **5-day SMA:** 100.81
*   **20-day SMA:** 98.86
*   **60-day SMA:** 93.40

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA and above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. The fact that the 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, and the 20-day SMA is above the 60-day SMA, suggests a possible upward trend in the short term. The recent change of -0.12 suggests a minor downward pressure, but this needs to be considered within the broader trend indicated by the moving averages.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 74.89 (Approaching Overbought territory)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.12 (Slightly Bearish Momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (3 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.4 (+) - Short term rising
*   **Expected Return (%):** -302.1% (Negative, significant underperformance expected relative to the S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The high MRI suggests the market generally considers the company to be a good investment at the moment.
*   An RSI close to 70 typically indicates overbought conditions, suggesting the price *may* be due for a pullback.
*   The slightly negative PPO suggests slightly bearish momentum.
*   The Hybrid Signal indicates to buy 90% of cash (3 shares), indicating the stock is a safe investment.
*   Despite the Hybrid Signal the extremely negative "Expected Return" is a *major* red flag. This suggests very pessimistic long-term projections, despite the higher Market Risk Indicator and Hybrid Signal.  This contradiction warrants further investigation.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Layoffs:** UPS announced 48,000 layoffs as part of a cost-saving initiative, which caused the stock to rally, potentially indicating investors viewed the move positively.
*   **Dividend:** Articles highlight UPS's high dividend yield.
*   **Analyst Outlooks:** Articles discuss the stock's outlook for 2026, including potential dividend yields, cost cuts, and rate hikes. Other articles provide more negative forecasts with significant risks in the coming year.
*   **Institutional Selling:** Pacer Advisors Inc. sold shares of UPS, which is a negative sentiment.

**Analysis:** The news paints a mixed picture. Cost-cutting measures (layoffs) seem to be received well, while dividend yield is attractive. However, articles also point to significant risks and difficulties ahead. Institutional selling may be a cause for concern.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean = 2.23)
*   **Target Price:** Average $103.83 (Suggests slight upside potential from the current price)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not provided

**Analysis:**  The consensus rating is "Buy," suggesting analysts generally view the stock favorably. The target price is also slightly above the current price, so investors can expect positive returns on average.

*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE has decreased significantly, indicating the company is generating less profit from shareholders' equity than it was a year ago.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

UPS presents a mixed picture. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Negative Signals:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. CAGR, Alpha, EPS, Revenue, Profit Margin and ROE have generally declined. The "Expected Return" is very negative. News articles hint at significant risks and difficulties ahead. The MDD is consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses.
*   **Positive Signals:** Analyst consensus is "Buy," and the target price suggests slight upside. The high MRI suggests the company is a good investment. The Hybrid Signal indicates to buy. Recent layoffs are intended to save money and improve efficiency.

**Conclusion:**

The contradictory information presented makes it difficult to make a conclusive investment decision. The negative factors seem to outweigh the positives, but the analyst ratings, Market Risk Indicator and Hybrid Signal are not aligned with the negative data. The extreme negative "Expected Return" should be the most concerning factor for long-term investors.

**Recommendation:**

*   Given the contradictory signals, it would be prudent to exercise caution and conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions regarding UPS.
*   Investigate the reasons for the extremely negative "Expected Return" and the factors contributing to the declining revenue, profit margins, and ROE.
*   Monitor the company's progress on its cost-saving initiatives and its ability to generate revenue growth in the future.
