**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  The cumulative return of UPS (16.34%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (113.65%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -97.3%, placing it at the 4.8th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $123.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $125.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $126.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $131.46

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (31.55):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.02):**  Slightly negative, implying bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (+3.2):** Shows a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-59.1%):**  This signifies a projected substantial underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if current trends continue.  Given the current price of $123.87 is below the moving averages and the expected return is significantly negative, there's a potential for further downside risk.  A sharp rebound is unlikely given the current indicators unless there's a significant market shift or company-specific positive news.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity has seen some volatility, while ROE fluctuates and demonstrates inconsistent profitability.  The higher equity in Q3 2023 could indicate a one-time event that needs further investigation beyond the data provided.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Information on market outlook is also absent.  This significantly limits the analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition but with bearish momentum.  The recent earnings data is mixed, with no consistent trend in revenue growth, EPS, or profit margins. The provided financial data also reveals some volatility in key metrics. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more detailed assessment of the current market sentiment and future prospects.  Further information is needed to provide a more complete analysis, including a comparison of reported earnings against analyst expectations.  The limited data paints a picture of inconsistent performance and warrants caution. The negative expected return should be taken very seriously.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the significant underperformance relative to the market, the mixed earnings results, the volatile financial indicators, and the lack of positive recent news, a cautious approach is recommended.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent performance and a comparison with industry peers is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The negative long-term expected return suggests that alternative investments may be more attractive.
