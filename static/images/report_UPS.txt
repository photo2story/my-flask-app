### 7. 종합(Overall) Analysis

UPS has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. Recent financial performance indicates declining revenue, EPS, and potentially profit margins. Although the Market Risk Indicator signals low risk and technical indicators provide mixed signals, the sharp drop in price and potential for continued decline should be taken into consideration. Investors should be cautious and closely monitor upcoming earnings reports, news related to regulatory changes, and global economic factors before making any decisions. The extremely negative Expected Return suggests a need to verify the data's accuracy.
