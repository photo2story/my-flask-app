**7. Overall Analysis & Conclusion**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, but its recent relative divergence suggests it might be nearing an oversold condition *relative to its own history*. While recent price action shows a short-term downtrend, the long-term expected return is attractive. Recent news suggests potential volatility. Revenue and profit margins appear relatively stable, but the declining EPS and ROE in the most recent quarter are concerning and warrant further investigation.

**Recommendation:** Given the conflicting signals (low MRI, high expected return vs. short-term downtrend and underperformance), a cautious approach is warranted. Monitoring upcoming earnings reports and company announcements is crucial. Consider a small, strategic entry point if you believe in the long-term growth potential, but be prepared for potential volatility.
