**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The cumulative return difference between UPS (4.71%) and the S&P 500 (VOO) (66.94%) is a stark -62.2%.  The provided alpha and beta values across different years reveal inconsistent performance relative to the market. While some periods (2015-2017, 2018-2020) show positive alpha (outperformance), others (2019-2021, 2020-2022) show significantly negative alpha, indicating underperformance. Beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying sensitivity to market movements.  The most recent years show consistently high MDD (Maximum Drawdown), indicative of significant risk.  A declining market capitalization (Cap(B)) from 2019 to 2025 further underscores the concerning trend.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

UPS's closing price is $99.66.  The stock experienced a recent jump, with an 8.42% increase from the previous close. However, this is against the backdrop of significantly lower moving averages:

* **5-day moving average:** $96.99
* **20-day moving average:** $109.52
* **60-day moving average:** $116.12

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting potential bearish momentum, although the recent price jump could signal a short-term reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk) suggests significant market volatility.
* **RSI:** 27.71 (below 30) indicates oversold conditions, potentially suggesting a short-term bounce.
* **PPO:** -1.59 (negative) suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A positive 3.5 indicates a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 25.4% is a high expected return relative to the recent performance, suggesting a potential long-term recovery given the current valuation.  The 8.42% price increase also needs to be considered as this may be a temporary change.  Further analysis needed.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent earnings show growth, the stock's performance has been volatile, with high risk indicated by the MRI and significant drawdowns. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, but the price remains below key moving averages.  The high expected return (25.4%) coupled with the recent price jump could present a long-term investment opportunity for a risk-tolerant investor, however,  a thorough investigation into the reasons for the underperformance against the market is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further macroeconomic and industry-specific analysis is recommended.
