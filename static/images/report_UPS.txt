2025-01-21 - Analysis Report
## United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.

The cumulative return of UPS is 23.31%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.37%.  The difference is -95.1%, placing it at the 5.4th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates UPS has underperformed the market significantly over the analyzed period.

The provided CAGR data shows highly variable performance, with periods of strong growth followed by significant declines.  The consistently low or zero Alpha suggests UPS's returns have largely tracked the market, explaining its underperformance relative to a market index like the S&P 500.  The Beta of around 111 is unusually high and needs further investigation as a beta of 1 is expected for a company following market trends.  This extremely high Beta suggests an unusual sensitivity to overall market movements or error in calculation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $129.73
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $127.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $125.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $129.66

The price is slightly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a possible short-term bearish trend, although the 5-day moving average is approaching the 60-day average, signaling possible recovery.  The recent price change shows a slight decrease (-$0.21 from the previous close).


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 59.66 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.60 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (No significant change in short-term relative performance.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -71.9% (This indicates a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, even over a long-term horizon.  This should be treated as an estimate, and the extreme negative value warrants further examination of the methodology employed.)

The recent price drop is relatively small and doesn't suggest a dramatic event. Given the negative expected return, any long-term investment should only be considered after thorough due diligence and potentially other valuation methods, taking into account the abnormally high beta value.

The extremely high beta and the unusually low expected return raise significant concerns. The inconsistencies in the provided data require further clarification and validation. A comprehensive analysis needs more data, including debt levels, cash flow, and a more thorough risk assessment, before any investment decisions can be made.  The unusually high beta value requires investigation to determine the cause.  Given the information provided, a long-term investment in UPS carries substantial risk.
