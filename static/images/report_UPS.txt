* **Closing Price:** $96.5
* **Previous Close:** $98.67
* **Change:** -$2.2 (a -2.22% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $97.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $105.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $114.17

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent drop of $2.2 indicates a short-term decline.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 30.26 (Oversold;  generally, values below 30 suggest oversold conditions)

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 21.2% (This is a significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but the risk associated with this expectation should be carefully considered)

The combination of oversold RSI and negative PPO suggests potential for a price bounce, but the overall trend remains bearish. The high expected return should be viewed with skepticism given the current underperformance and market risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, displaying inconsistent performance over the past few years. While the stock shows signs of being oversold based on RSI, the negative PPO and downward price trends raise concerns. The projected long-term expected return needs to be evaluated carefully against the current market conditions and inherent risk, particularly given the company's recent financial performance.  Before investing, a thorough review of the company's future prospects and potential catalysts for growth is necessary.  The duplicated earnings data point needs clarification.
