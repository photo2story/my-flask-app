**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

UPS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a cumulative return of only 10.42% compared to VOO's 121.84%. The  -111.4% difference highlights a substantial lag. The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results across different periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), suggesting periods of strong management, many show negative alpha, indicating underperformance.  The beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, fluctuates but generally stays around 1, meaning UPS tends to follow the overall market trends but with increased volatility in some periods as reflected by the MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  The changing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects changes in the company's valuation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $116.22
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $114.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $121.64
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $126.23

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 17.84 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound but also highlighting the low relative strength.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.28 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.2 – This confirms a short-term bearish trend.
* **Expected Return:** -462.9% – This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning.  It strongly suggests that this model predicts significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment. This warrants further investigation into the model's assumptions.  The recent price increase of $0.58 (from previous close)  does not significantly alter this negative outlook.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS's performance significantly lags behind the S&P 500, showing a substantial negative alpha and relative divergence. While recent earnings show growth, the negative expected return and low technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest a bearish outlook in the short to medium term.  The extremely negative projected long-term return (-462.9%) is especially alarming and requires further scrutiny of the underlying model.  The financial information shows no alarming trends, but the valuation compared to S&P 500's performance is concerning. Before considering any investment, a thorough investigation into the causes of the underperformance is crucial, including examining sector-specific factors impacting UPS, assessing the accuracy and methodology of the  -462.9% expected return projection, and confirming the accuracy of the earnings data.  Further research is needed to determine if this represents an actual opportunity or a fundamentally weaker investment compared to the broader market.
