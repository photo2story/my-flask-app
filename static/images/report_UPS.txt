**6) Overall Analysis:**

UPS currently shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  While some technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce (low RSI), the overall picture is bearish due to negative PPO, negative relative divergence, and significantly lower returns.  The company's financial performance shows some stability, but profit margins and ROE have shown a recent decline.  The long-term expected return is significantly negative relative to the S&P 500 (-69.5%).  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data and a deeper dive into the company's specific challenges are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The current data suggests a cautious approach.  Consideration of broader macroeconomic factors and sector-specific trends is also crucial.
