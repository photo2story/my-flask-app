**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue shows some growth, although profit margins fluctuate. Equity has decreased slightly recently, and ROE (Return on Equity) has also declined in recent quarters. This warrants further investigation into the reasons for the decline in profitability and ROE.

| 2023-12-31 | $17.31B     | 9.27%  |


**6) Overall Conclusion:**

UPS currently exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a substantially negative expected return (-36.6%). While some short-term indicators (such as the recent relative divergence change) suggest potential short-term upward movement, the overall picture is bearish.  The high market risk (MRI), oversold RSI, negative PPO, and declining ROE raise concerns. The consistently negative Alpha in recent periods confirms significant underperformance relative to the market.  A long-term investment strategy should carefully consider these factors,  and further investigation into the reasons behind the declining profitability and EPS growth is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests significant risks associated with investing in UPS at the current time.
