*   **CAGR:** Fluctuating CAGR indicates inconsistent growth over different periods, with recent years showing negative growth.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values suggest significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Negative Alpha in many periods suggests underperformance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500).
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to zero indicate that UPS stock has been relatively uncorrelated with the broader market. Recent Betas approaching 1 suggest correlation may be increasing.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization trend shows that the company experienced growth until 2021, but has since trended downward again.

**2) Recent Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 93.49
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 93.33, Previous Close: 93.25, Change: 0.09
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 95.29
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 88.73
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 86.66

**Analysis:**

The current price is below the 5-day moving average, but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a possible short-term pullback after a recent uptrend. The small 'change' in the Last Market data doesn't indicate a significant price swing at the very end of the last trading session.

**3) Market Risk Indicator & Other Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 71.20 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.83
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash
*   **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** 2.1 (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.
*   **Expected Return:** -562.2% (This is a VERY negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500.)

**Analysis:**

The MRI suggests that, from a market risk perspective, investment is currently recommended.  However, the RSI indicates that the stock might be overbought in the short term. The positive change in relative divergence reinforces the upward momentum, but the very negative Expected Return is a serious concern. The Hybrid Signal recommends full investment with no cash holding, but it is important to consider other factors before making investment decisions.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

    *   UPS Cargo Plane Crash: A significant negative event. This will likely negatively impact the stock in the short term due to potential liabilities, logistical disruptions, and reputational damage.

*   **Recent Price Action:** Recent price action shows a potential short-term bounce, but the RSI indicates overbought conditions.
*   **Market Risk:** The MRI suggests low market risk, but the significantly negative Expected Return is a major red flag, indicating that, based on the provided analysis, it is not an ideal opportunity for long-term investment.
*   **News:** The recent plane crash is a negative event that will likely impact the stock.
*   **Analyst Opinions:** Analysts are generally positive, but the wide range in target prices suggests uncertainty.
*   **Financials:** Revenue, profit margins, and ROE have all fluctuated, with recent declines in revenue.

**Overall Assessment:**

Based on this data, UPS presents a mixed picture. While analysts are generally positive and the MRI suggests low market risk, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, recent negative news, declining revenue, and a highly negative expected return raise serious concerns. Before making any investment decisions, it's important to consider the impact of the cargo plane crash and conduct further due diligence to understand the reasons behind the negative expected return and recent financial performance.
