**Analysis of Alpha/Beta:**
    * **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows significant volatility over different periods, with strong growth in some years and sharp declines in others. The recent negative CAGR values are concerning.
    * **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates substantial risk, with drawdowns often exceeding 60%. This suggests high volatility and potential for significant losses.
    * **Alpha:** The Alpha values are largely negative, particularly in recent periods, indicating underperformance relative to the market. A strongly negative Alpha suggests UPS is not generating returns independently of market movements.
    * **Beta:** The Beta values fluctuate but generally show a slight inverse correlation to the market. This means UPS tends to move opposite to the market, which could be beneficial in some situations but is currently contributing to its underperformance.
    * **Cap(B):** The Capitalization in Billions (Cap(B)) shows fluctuations reflecting market sentiment and company performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Price:** 95.21. The last market activity shows a slight increase.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: 94.95 (Slightly below the current price)
    *   20-day SMA: 94.30 (Below the current price)
    *   60-day SMA: 88.86 (Well below the current price)

**Analysis of Stock Price Fluctuations:** The stock price is currently trading above its 5-day and 20-day simple moving averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term upward trend. The 60-day SMA is significantly lower, indicating a longer-term uptrend may be forming but needs confirmation.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence & Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - This seems contradictory given the other indicators and should be interpreted cautiously. High MRI may be a result of undervaluation of current market price.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 56.66 (Neutral) - This suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.18 (Slightly Bearish) - A negative PPO suggests a slight downtrend, but the value is very close to zero.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) - This signals that the system recommends buying shares.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -2.9 (Negative - Short-term Decline) - This confirms a recent downward trend relative to the comparison stock.
*   **Expected Return:** -488.9% - This is an extremely negative forecast, suggesting substantial potential losses if invested long-term.

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, which is in conflict with the expected return. The recent divergence change suggests short-term negative movement, and the extremely negative expected return raises significant concerns about the long-term investment potential.
