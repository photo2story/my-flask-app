* **5-Day Moving Average:** $96.19
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $100.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $111.20

The price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price increase of $0.38 (from previous close) is relatively small compared to the longer-term downtrend.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 33.38 (Suggests oversold conditions, but should be interpreted with caution given other indicators)
* **PPO:** 0.175 (Positive, but relatively low)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.3 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 153.2% (This high expected return needs further justification and clarification regarding its calculation methodology, especially considering the recent underperformance)

The combination of a relatively low RSI, negative recent relative divergence, and the price being below its moving averages suggests bearish momentum. However, the high expected return warrants a deeper investigation of its underlying assumptions.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
