| Date       | EPS | Revenue          |
|------------|-----|-----------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.8 | 22.25 B$         |

Earnings Per Share (EPS) shows a general upward trend, though the last entry is duplicated. Revenue also generally shows a slight increase.  More data and verification are needed to draw strong conclusions.  The duplicate entry suggests significant issues with the data's accuracy and reliability.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data severely limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing data prevents a proper assessment of UPS's profitability and overall financial health.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

The provided data paints a concerning picture for UPS.  The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, showing consistent negative alpha and high sensitivity to market fluctuations in recent years. Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the extremely negative expected return and the significant inconsistencies in the data raise serious concerns. The missing financial information further hinders a thorough evaluation.  The accuracy of the supplied data needs serious investigation before making any investment decisions.   Given the current data and its limitations, a long-term investment in UPS relative to the S&P 500 carries substantial risk.  Further investigation is strongly recommended before considering any investment.
