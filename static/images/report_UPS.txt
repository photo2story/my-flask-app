*   **Hybrid Signal:** This seems to be a system-generated signal suggesting buying 80% of available cash (for 1 share).  The "Caution" flag and reference to the MRI suggest some level of risk awareness.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change confirms the recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is highly unusual and likely an anomaly or error in the data. It would suggest a catastrophic outlook for the stock, which needs further investigation.

**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

UPS is currently facing significant challenges. It is substantially underperforming the S&P 500, with a deeply negative cumulative return and the divergence at its lowest point in the observed range.

Recent news is mixed, with positive developments like the Amex partnership offset by concerns regarding dividend yield and potential impacts from tariffs.

Technically, the stock is oversold (RSI below 30) and trading below its moving averages, indicating bearish momentum. While the low MRI suggests a generally stable market environment, UPS specific risk appears elevated. The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, which requires further investigation.

While analysts maintain a "Buy" consensus with significant upside potential, investors should exercise caution due to the mixed signals and recent underperformance. The key will be to monitor the company's ability to improve revenue growth, profitability, and manage external risks related to tariffs and economic conditions.
