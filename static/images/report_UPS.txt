## United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  The cumulative return for UPS is 19.61%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.74%.  The difference is -93.1%, placing it at the 6.8th percentile of its historical relative divergence against the S&P 500.  This indicates that UPS's performance has lagged considerably behind the broader market.

The provided CAGR data shows significant variability in UPS's performance over different time periods, ranging from a high of 102% to a low of -73%. The high volatility is also reflected in the maximum drawdown (MDD) figures.  Importantly, the alpha consistently registers at 0.0, suggesting that UPS's returns are primarily driven by market movements (beta) rather than exhibiting significant alpha (excess returns relative to the market).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $125.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $125.17
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $125.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $129.83

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages suggests relatively low volatility in the last month.

* **PPO:** 0.18 (Slightly positive, indicating potential upward momentum)

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -51.1% (Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 expected over the long term)

The indicators provide a mixed signal. While the PPO shows slight positive momentum, the negative expected return and the price being below its moving averages suggest caution.  The closing price of $125.84 does not suggest any significant recent price jumps (no indication of a sudden surge or drop).

**7. Overall Conclusion:**

UPS has shown significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the longer term. While recent earnings indicate improving EPS,  the overall outlook appears cautious.  The negative projected long-term return compared to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  The mixed signals from the technical indicators suggest further investigation is needed before making investment decisions. The significant historical volatility makes UPS a riskier investment compared to the broader market.  Investors considering UPS should carefully weigh the potential for improved earnings against the historical underperformance and significant risk involved.  The predicted negative alpha highlights the lack of excess return generation relative to the market benchmark.  Therefore, a long-term investment in UPS would likely be considerably underperforming a passive investment in the S&P 500.
