**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR is declining, with recent periods showing significant negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  High MDD indicates significant risk and volatility.

*   **Beta:**  Beta fluctuates, showing that UPS's price movement has sometimes been contrary to the market. A positive beta in recent years suggests the stock has become more sensitive to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap has been fluctuating, with a general trend of decreasing market capitalization in recent years.

**2. Recent Stock Price Action:**

*   **Current Price:** 82.665
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 82.685, 'previousClose': 85.28, 'change': -3.04} (A noticeable drop from the previous close)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 85.659
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 84.5215
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 87.8392

**Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60-day), suggesting a short-term and medium-term downtrend. The recent price drop of -3.04 indicates negative momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 44.02 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.2984 (Positive, but close to zero, suggesting weakening momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Suggests a full investment strategy.
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.2 (+): Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return (%):** -2775.4 (Very Negative - Long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** Despite the "High Investment Recommended" MRI, the negative expected return is very concerning. The RSI is neutral. The positive Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence indicates some short-term recovery, but the overall picture is still bearish. The significant price drop reflected in the Last Market Data reinforces the negative sentiment.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Delta Air Lines (DAL) Profit Margins Slip:** This could indirectly impact UPS if it reflects broader economic concerns.
*   **PepsiCo CFO Change:** Unlikely to directly impact UPS.
*   **Tony Robbins Article:** Irrelevant to UPS's performance.
*   **CFOs On the Move:** Irrelevant to UPS's performance.
*   **UPS Sees a More Significant Dip Than Broader Market:** Confirms underperformance.
*   **UPS Halts Money-Back Guarantee on US Imports:**  This is a potentially negative development due to de minimis changes, impacting customer satisfaction and potentially shipping volume.

**5. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.26)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 100.80 / 133.00 / 75.00

**Analysis:**  Analysts are generally positive on UPS with a "Buy" consensus and an average target price of $100.80. However, the low target of $75.00 indicates some analysts are more pessimistic. The lack of recent rating changes suggests a stable outlook (though potentially outdated given the recent price declines).

| 2024-06-30 | $17.03B  | 8.27%     |

**Analysis:** Revenue has decreased from the peak in 2024-12-31, and the profit margin is also showing slight volatility. Equity has been decreasing over the last few quarters, and ROE has also shown a decreasing trend, indicating potentially diminishing returns on equity.

**8. 종합 Conclusion:**

UPS is currently facing significant challenges. While analysts have a "Buy" consensus, the stock's recent performance has been poor, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. Revenue and EPS have been declining. The halting of the money-back guarantee on US imports is a potential negative catalyst.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a **hold or cautious sell** recommendation is appropriate. While analysts are optimistic, the negative technical indicators, underperformance relative to the market, declining revenue and EPS, and potential negative impacts from the halted money-back guarantee suggest caution. Further investigation is needed to assess the long-term impact of these issues and whether UPS can turn around its performance. Consider the negative expected return and recent news when making investment decisions.
