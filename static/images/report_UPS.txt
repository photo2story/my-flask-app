* **20-Day Moving Average:** $107.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $115.18

The combination of a high MRI, low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests a bearish sentiment.  However, the expected return of 23.5% over the long term is positive, suggesting that despite the current bearish trend, a long-term investment might still be profitable compared to the S&P 500. The small price increase needs further observation to assess if it signifies a rebound.
