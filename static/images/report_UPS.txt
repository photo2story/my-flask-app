**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the period shown.  While recent earnings show growth, profit margins and ROE have shown some recent decline. Technical indicators suggest neutral to slightly bullish momentum, but the negative expected return and the price being below its moving averages suggest caution.  The significant divergence from the S&P 500 and the inconsistent historical performance highlight significant risk.  Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and clarification of inconsistent data points (duplicate earnings data) is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The -61.6% expected return should be viewed with skepticism given the data inconsistencies.  A thorough review of the company's strategic initiatives and competitive landscape would be needed for a fully informed assessment.
