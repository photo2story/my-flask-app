**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods.  While alpha is generally positive (indicating potential outperformance),  it's inconsistent and  beta is high (above 1 in most periods), suggesting high market sensitivity. The large swings in CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlight significant volatility in UPS's performance.  The recent negative CAGR is particularly concerning.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

* **Closing Price:** $96.43
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $96.58
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $103.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $112.99

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase of $2.37 (2.5%) might indicate a short-term bounce, but the overall trend remains bearish.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.43 (Oversold, suggesting potential for a price bounce, but not confirming a trend reversal.)
* **PPO:** -0.43 (Negative PPO confirms bearish momentum.)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +1.4 (Short-term upward movement in relative performance, but still significantly below the S&P 500.)
* **Expected Return:** 115.9% (This is a remarkably high projected return.  The context and calculation method for this figure are missing and require further explanation to assess its validity.)
* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium risk, indicating moderate volatility. )

The significant price change of $2.37 indicates a recent price bounce, but the RSI and PPO suggest further downside potential.  The high expected return needs clarification before interpretation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in EPS and revenue, although recent growth has slowed. The duplicate entry for 2024-11-06 needs clarification.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period reviewed. While recent earnings show growth, profit margins and ROE are declining, causing concern.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the overall trend is bearish. The extremely high projected return requires further investigation and validation.  Before investing, it is crucial to conduct thorough due diligence, including an analysis of the company's competitive landscape, future growth prospects, and macroeconomic factors that might impact its performance. The provided data alone is insufficient for a conclusive investment recommendation.  The inconsistencies within the data (duplicate entry, high expected return without context) further emphasize the need for more thorough investigation.
