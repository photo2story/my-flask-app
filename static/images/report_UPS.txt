### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** 86.25
*   **Previous Close:** 85.98
*   **Change:** 0.31
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 86.24
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 84.62
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 88.12

**Analysis:** The stock is slightly up from the previous close.  The 5-day moving average is slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the price is below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance. The recent change of 0.31 is not significantly high enough to suggest a major volatility event.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 56.62 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.60 (Positive but weak)
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (12 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 1.1 (+) (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -1493.6% (Significant Underperformance vs. S&P 500 in the Long Term)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended" level, which might be driven by other factors despite the underperformance. The RSI is neutral, neither overbought nor oversold. The PPO indicates a slight upward trend.  The Hybrid Signal recommends a full investment, likely due to the high MRI, but the extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. The recent increase in relative divergence suggests some short-term improvement compared to the S&P 500, but it's not enough to offset the overall negative outlook.

### 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Buyback Aristocrat:** UPS identified as one of the best "buyback aristocrat" stocks. This might indicate management believes the stock is undervalued and is returning capital to shareholders.
*   **Stoke Space Funding:** News about funding for a space startup is unlikely to directly impact UPS.
*   **Penang Expansion:** UPS expanding its presence in Penang suggests growth in international operations and a focus on Asian markets.
*   **Q3 Earnings Preview:** An article previewing UPS's Q3 2025 earnings report suggests the market is anticipating the upcoming results.
*   **Goldman Sachs Price Target Adjustment:** Goldman Sachs adjusting its price target *down* to $116 while maintaining a "Buy" rating suggests they still see upside but have tempered their expectations.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. The "Buyback Aristocrat" label is positive. The Penang expansion shows growth. However, the lowered price target from Goldman Sachs indicates some concern, and the focus on the upcoming earnings report suggests uncertainty.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (2.26)
*   **Target Price:** 100.83 (Average), 133.00 (High), 75.00 (Low)

**Analysis:** Despite the recent underperformance, analysts, on average, still rate the stock as a "Buy" with an average target price of $100.83. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices ($75 to $133) reflects uncertainty in the outlook.

### 5. Recent Earnings Analysis

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출        |
|------------|------|-------------|

**Analysis:** Recent EPS and revenue figures show some volatility. While there are some positive changes, the flat revenue in the most recent quarter (2025-08-06) is a point of concern, the decrease in EPS from 1.65 to 1.51 is something to be careful of.

**Analysis:** Revenue shows a seasonal pattern, with the highest revenue in Q4 (December 31st) likely due to holiday shipping. Profit margins have fluctuated. Equity has been decreasing slightly, and ROE has also decreased, which is concerning.

### 7. Overall Summary

UPS is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  Recent financial data indicates some weakness in revenue growth and profitability. While analysts generally have a "Buy" rating, the lowered price target from Goldman Sachs and the wide range of price targets suggest caution.

**Key Concerns:**

*   Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   Decreasing ROE.
*   A negative expected return raises serious questions about long-term investment potential.

**Potential Positives:**

*   The "Buyback Aristocrat" designation.
*   Expansion in Asian markets (Penang).
*   High MRI indicating overall market conditions may be favorable, despite UPS's specific struggles.

**Recommendation:**

While the MRI and analyst ratings might suggest a buy, the significant underperformance, decreasing ROE, and negative expected return warrant caution. Investors should carefully consider the risks before investing in UPS. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and whether the company has a viable plan to improve its financial performance and market position. The recommendation is to HOLD or potentially reduce exposure until there are clearer signs of improvement.
