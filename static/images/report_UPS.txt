**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  Over the review period, UPS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 20.59% compared to the S&P 500's 82.57%. This represents a difference of -62.0%.  While this underperformance is substantial, the relative divergence of 4.7% suggests it's not the worst the stock has performed historically relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta).  While some periods exhibit positive alpha (outperformance), others show significant negative alpha, particularly in recent years.  The high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) also highlight significant periods of risk. The shrinking market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the last two years  is also noteworthy.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price ($98.92) is below both the 20-day ($100.19) and 60-day ($110.63) moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The 5-day moving average ($97.13) being slightly below the current price hints at some recent price recovery.


**3. Technical Indicators & Divergence:**

The RSI of 48.05 is near the neutral level (50), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.  A PPO of 0.44 suggests bullish momentum. The recent negative relative divergence (-3.4%) points to a short-term downward trend. The MRI of 0.4053 suggests a medium risk level.  The high expected return of 215.2% is noteworthy, but it's crucial to consider the high inherent risk indicated by the previous analysis.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue          |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.8  | $22.25 Billion   |
| 2024-08-07 | 1.65 | $21.82 Billion   |
| 2024-05-03 | 1.3  | $21.71 Billion   |
| 2023-11-01 | 1.31 | $21.06 Billion   |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.31 | $21.06 Billion   |


There seems to be a duplicate entry for 2024-11-06.  Ignoring the duplicate, earnings show a generally upward trend in both EPS and revenue, although the most recent quarter experienced a significant jump in EPS compared to the previous quarters.  Further analysis requires more complete data.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing data prevents a robust assessment of profitability and financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent times, presenting a riskier investment compared to the broader market. While recent earnings show growth, the lack of complete financial data hinders a more in-depth analysis.  Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with a slightly bearish short-term trend countered by positive momentum signals. The high projected long-term return should be viewed with caution given the substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the high maximum drawdowns observed in the past.  More data (particularly complete financial statements) is needed to form a conclusive opinion.  Investors should carefully consider the risks involved before investing in UPS.
