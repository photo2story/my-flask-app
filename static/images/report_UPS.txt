**7. Overall Summary and Recommendation**

UPS has demonstrated significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and this trend is a major concern. While recent price action shows upward momentum, the RSI suggests the stock might be overbought. Analyst consensus is "Buy," but price targets don't indicate substantial upside. Revenue and earnings data show recent declines, and the long-term expected return is alarmingly negative.

The partnership with the Postal Service and cost-saving measures (like potential benefits from truck driver wage stagnation) could provide some support. However, the negative long-term outlook, volatile financial performance, and significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 outweigh the positive aspects.

**Recommendation:**

Despite the "Buy" consensus, the extremely negative expected return and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 warrants caution. It's better to wait for more clear signal.
