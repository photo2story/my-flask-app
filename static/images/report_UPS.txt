**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS's recent performance has been considerably weaker than the broader market, as reflected by the significant negative divergence from the S&P 500. While recent earnings show some growth, the projected long-term underperformance (-86.8% relative to the S&P 500) is a major concern. The technical indicators present a mixed picture, with some suggesting overbought conditions and short-term bearish sentiment.  Data inconsistencies in the earnings data require further investigation.  Overall, based on the current data, UPS presents a high-risk investment.  Further due diligence, including a comprehensive analysis of the reasons behind the underperformance and a thorough review of the conflicting earnings data, is strongly recommended before any investment decision.
