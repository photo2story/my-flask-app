*   **Expected Return:** -155.9% (vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a low market risk environment for UPS. The RSI is nearing overbought territory (above 70 is typically considered overbought), suggesting the stock might be due for a pullback. The PPO is low. The Hybrid Signal recommends buying a portion of available cash, but with caution. The positive change in relative spread indicates a potential short-term upward movement relative to the S&P 500, but the *extremely* negative expected return is a significant concern, projecting substantial underperformance versus the S&P 500 over the long term. The recent price change of -0.83, while negative, is not drastic enough to indicate a major volatility event.
