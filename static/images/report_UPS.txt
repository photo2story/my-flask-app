## United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.

The cumulative return for UPS over the reviewed period is 23.58%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference is -92.8%, placing it at the 7th percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (max: 40.8%, min: -102.8%).  This indicates substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance, with periods of strong growth (e.g., 2019-2021) followed by significant declines (e.g., 2022-2024).  The consistently low alpha (0.0) suggests that UPS's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta), with minimal outperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $130.01
* **Last Market Price:** $129.98
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $126.32
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $125.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $129.66

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. However, it is close to the 60-day moving average, indicating potential consolidation or further price movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.78  (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.51 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.6 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -52.6% (significantly below S&P 500)


The relatively high RSI and positive PPO suggest potential for continued upward momentum, but the large negative expected return highlights the significant risk.  The current price of $129.98 is not significantly different from the last market price, suggesting no major price jumps or drops. The -52.6% expected return compared to the S&P 500 indicates significant underperformance projected over the long term.

The significant divergence from market performance and projected underperformance warrant a cautious approach.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's strategic initiatives and competitive landscape, is crucial before making any investment decisions. The data inconsistencies require clarification.
