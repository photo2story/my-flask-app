**0) Introduction:**

This report analyzes United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS), a global package delivery and supply chain management company, based on the provided financial data.  The analysis will cover performance metrics, recent trends, and future outlook relative to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

UPS's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's.

* **UPS Cumulative Return:** 20.59%
* **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 82.57%
* **Return Difference:** -61.98%
* **Relative Divergence:** 4.7% (This indicates UPS's performance is near the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500).

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market. While periods of strong outperformance (high Alpha) exist,  the recent performance (2022-2025) shows substantial underperformance and high negative CAGR, suggesting significant market sensitivity (Beta doesn't consistently reflect this).  The fluctuating market capitalization (Cap(B)) also reflects the volatile nature of UPS's performance during this period.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 37.0% | 55.5% | 4.0% | 0.1 | 78.4 |
| 2016-2018  | 11.0% | 16.3% | -10.0% | 0.1 | 66.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 19.0% | 16.3% | -15.0% | 1.6 | 82.3 |
| 2018-2020  | 54.0% | 16.3% | 24.0% | 1.4 | 122.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 108.0% | 62.0% | 47.0% | 1.3 | 159.1 |
| 2020-2022  | 76.0% | 67.4% | 67.0% | 1.1 | 133.3 |
| 2021-2023  | 6.0% | 69.3% | -15.0% | 0.7 | 125.3 |
| 2022-2024  | -65.0% | 71.2% | -85.0% | 0.7 | 105.4 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $98.92
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $97.13
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $100.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $110.63

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price increase (Last-market) shows a 1.76 point increase from the previous close, possibly indicating short-term upward pressure but not changing overall downward trend.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 48.05 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.44 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum, but needs further context)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.4% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** 215.2% (This high expected return needs further justification and context, especially given recent underperformance).  A 215.2% return over a 2-year period is exceptionally high and requires detailed analysis for validation.

The positive change in 'Last-market' suggests a small but recent price recovery but this has to be interpreted in context with the negative trend displayed in moving averages. The high expected return is highly unusual given the recent poor performance and should be scrutinized further.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue        |
|------------|------|----------------|

Revenue shows some growth but is not dramatically increasing.  Further investigation is needed to clarify the data duplication and understand revenue growth drivers.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

UPS shows mixed signals. While recent earnings suggest improving profitability and revenue growth, the stock's performance lags significantly behind the S&P 500.  The high expected return requires further justification and critical evaluation. The short-term price movement is uncertain, with recent positive change contrasted against overall negative trends.  Before investing, a thorough review of the company's strategic direction, competitive landscape, and macroeconomic factors is crucial.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry) and the extremely high projected return raise serious concerns about data quality and the reliability of the projections. Further investigation is necessary to validate the provided data and draw more robust conclusions.
