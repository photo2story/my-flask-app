**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  The cumulative return of UPS over the analyzed period is 28.24%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 126.85%. The difference is -98.61%, placing it at the 2.84 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha and beta values show varying performance relative to the market, with periods of both outperformance and significant underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $131.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $132.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $132.21
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $130.56

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (47.16):**  Indicates the stock is nearing oversold territory, but not yet decisively so.
* **PPO (-0.02):** Suggests a slightly bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (-3.42):** Shows a recent weakening in relative strength against the market.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided expected return of 0% indicates that, given the current data, there is no expectation of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  This is a conservative prediction and should be considered in the context of other analyses.  Given the significant underperformance relative to VOO, there's a potential for outperformance if UPS significantly improves its financial performance.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS and revenue data show relatively stable growth over time.  However, a full analysis would require comparing these figures to previous expectations and industry benchmarks. The most recent earnings (2024-11-06) of $1.8 EPS and $22.25B in revenue requires analysis against analyst expectations to determine whether it was a beat or miss.  Lack of that information restricts a full evaluation.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains high. Profit margins have seen some quarterly variation, with a dip in the quarters of 2024, before recovering again in the last quarter of 2023.  The data for Return on Equity (ROE) is similarly inconsistent, suggesting a need to examine the drivers behind these fluctuations for a more in-depth understanding of the company's financial health.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

UPS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While some quarters show strong earnings and revenue, overall performance has been disappointing.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook.  The absence of analyst expectations for the most recent earnings prevents a comprehensive analysis of recent results.  A thorough review of recent news and analyst reports, as well as a more comprehensive financial analysis beyond the data provided, is crucial for a complete assessment.  The provided long-term expected return of 0% is predicated on the historical underperformance against the market and doesn't factor in possible future market changes, UPS's business strategy adaptations, and the potential for improved financial performance.


**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the underperformance and mixed signals from the technical indicators, further investigation is necessary before recommending any investment strategy.  A thorough analysis of current market conditions, UPS's competitive landscape, and the details of their recent earnings compared to analyst expectations are essential to forming an informed opinion.  Considering UPSâ€™s current situation, carefully evaluating any investment decision with a risk-reward assessment relative to the S&P 500 is vital.
