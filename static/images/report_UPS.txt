## United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

United Parcel Service Inc (UPS) is a global package delivery and supply chain management company.  The provided data shows UPS's cumulative return is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  Specifically, UPS has a cumulative return of 32.48%, while VOO boasts a 130.06% return. This results in a substantial divergence of -97.6%, placing it at the 3.6th percentile of its historical range of divergence against VOO (-102.6% to 38%).  This indicates UPS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.

The provided CAGR data shows volatile performance. While some periods show strong growth (e.g., 2019-2021), others reveal substantial declines (e.g., 2022-2024), highlighting the company's sensitivity to market cycles. The consistently low alpha (0.0) suggests UPS's returns closely track the market, with little to no outperformance.  The beta values, while fluctuating, largely indicate a high correlation with market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $135.72 (Last Market: $136.23)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $135.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $132.81
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $131.35

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting some recent downward pressure. However, it sits above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term support level.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the last market price suggests minimal volatility on the last trading day.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.12 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, falling within a neutral range.
* **PPO:** 0.28 –  A positive PPO indicates bullish momentum, though relatively weak.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** NaN (-) - Indicates a recent short-term downward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – This indicates that based on the provided data, no significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is expected over the long term (2+ years) with a buy-and-hold strategy.  The negative divergence and recent price action suggest caution.  A significant jump to $136.23 would not represent a significant change in trend given recent price movements.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a mixed picture.  While revenue has generally increased quarter-over-quarter, the growth rate appears to be slowing.  EPS also shows an upward trend, however, the Q4 2024 EPS is notably lower than the previous quarter, and the second entry for 2024-11-06 is a duplicate.  There is no information available to compare these numbers against expectations, therefore beats or misses cannot be evaluated.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows some fluctuation, with a notable decrease between Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.  Overall, revenue growth seems to have slowed recently.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are generally high, but have experienced some volatility. The margin decreased significantly from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024, which warrants further investigation.
* **Equity and ROE:** Equity has fluctuated, and ROE has generally shown improvement, although there was a decrease in Q1 2024.  The significant drop in equity from Q3 2023 to Q4 2023 is notable and requires further investigation into the underlying causes.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news or market outlook information was provided. Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing. This lack of current information limits a thorough assessment of the stock's current market standing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

UPS has shown substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the period reviewed,  accompanied by considerable volatility in both revenue and profitability. While recent technical indicators aren't definitively bearish, they do not suggest strong upward momentum.  The provided data raises concerns regarding the slowing revenue growth, fluctuating profit margins, and recent decline in EPS.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions hinders a full evaluation.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the recent underperformance and to assess the long-term prospects of the company.  Given the current data, a cautious approach is advised.
