* **Closing Price:** $290.14
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $292.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $313.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $341.90

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent drop from the previous close (-1.12) reinforces this.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 31.26 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.43 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -3.0 (Short-term bearish trend)

The combination of oversold RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the recent price drop, paints a somewhat bearish picture in the short term. However, the high expected return suggests significant long-term potential.  The -1.12 change in price from the previous close is a noteworthy short-term negative indicator.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Caterpillar demonstrates a strong long-term performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bearish trend.  The high expected return, coupled with generally strong financial results, makes CAT an attractive prospect for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and clarification on the unusually high Alpha values in the Alpha/Beta analysis is recommended.  The relatively high Beta indicates higher-than-market volatility, which should be considered.
