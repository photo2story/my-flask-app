*   **Mixed News:** News headlines present both positive catalysts and potential headwinds.

*   **High Risk Indicator :** Although high MDD is noted in past, the current risk indicator is high

**Investment Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is warranted. While the MRI and hybrid signal indicate a favorable investment environment, the overbought RSI and the relative spread position near its historical minimum suggest a potential pullback in the short term.

Here's a possible strategy:

*   **Short-Term:**  Be cautious given the overbought conditions. Consider waiting for a pullback before initiating or adding to a position.
*   **Long-Term:** Caterpillar remains a fundamentally strong company in a cyclical industry. If you believe in the long-term growth of global infrastructure and construction, CAT could be a reasonable long-term investment, especially if acquired at a more favorable price. However, the negative expected return (vs. S&P 500) should be carefully considered. Keep monitoring the news regarding trade policies and the company's ability to maintain its profit margins.
