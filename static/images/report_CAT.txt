The company demonstrates consistent profitability and revenue generation, although some fluctuation exists in both EPS and profit margins.  The high beta indicates higher risk but also the potential for substantial returns.  A long-term (2+ years) investment approach, as suggested by the high expected return, may be appropriate for investors with a higher risk tolerance.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry and potential cyclical market factors affecting the company is recommended before making investment decisions.
