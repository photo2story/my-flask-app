## Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) is a leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment.  The cumulative return for CAT is 213.08%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.56%. The difference is 95.5%, placing it at the 70.6th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong historical outperformance, but it's crucial to remember past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) ranging from 0.1 to 0.1 across all periods, indicating the stock's tendency to outperform the market.  Beta values increase over time (from 65 to 177), suggesting increased market sensitivity during the later periods.  This implies higher risk and potential volatility, even with consistent alpha. CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates, indicating variable growth over the years, with a period of negative growth (2018-2020).  Maximum drawdown (MDD) values indicate significant periods of price decline within the investment horizon.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 365.39
* **Last Market Price:** 367.57
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 366.30
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 388.14
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 389.42

The stock price is currently trading below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The relatively close proximity of the closing and last market prices indicates no significant immediate price movement since the last market close.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 19.34 - This extremely low RSI value indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce back is possible. However, this is not a guaranteed signal.

* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.92 - A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum, aligning with the RSI.

* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -4.7% - The negative change further supports the short-term bearish momentum.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 121.2% - This represents a significant potential outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term. However, this is a projection, and actual returns may differ significantly.  The Last Market Price (367.57) is close enough to the closing price to not warrant the inclusion of a separate discussion on rapid price movement.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some volatility:

* **EPS:** EPS has fluctuated slightly, but generally remained stable around $5.50 over the past four quarters.  There was a slight dip in the most recent quarter (Nov 6, 2024).
* **Revenue:** Revenue has remained relatively consistent, around $16-17 Billion, with slight variations.  There is no clear upward or downward trend evident.
