**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) is a manufacturer of construction and mining equipment.  The cumulative return of CAT is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  As of the last data point, CAT's cumulative return is 199.09%, while VOO's is 112.20%.  This results in a raw return difference of 86.9 percentage points. The relative divergence, considering historical volatility, places this performance at the 65.3rd percentile, indicating it outperformed the S&P 500 more often than not historically but not consistently exceptionally.

While generally outperforming the market, there are periods of underperformance (e.g., 2018-2020).  The alpha consistently remains around 0.1, suggesting a modest outperformance relative to the market benchmark, supported by a beta that fluctuates significantly (ranging from 53.0 to 175.0), indicating varying levels of market sensitivity across time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $351.00
* **5-day Moving Average:** $360.61
* **20-day Moving Average:** $367.44
* **60-day Moving Average:** $383.80

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 32.79 - This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is due.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.17 - A negative PPO value confirms the current downtrend.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -3.8% - This short-term decline needs further evaluation considering the RSI.
* **Expected Return:** 32.5% - This represents a significant outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), assuming this rate of outperformance continues.  The current price of $351.00, given it's below the moving averages, doesn't necessarily indicate a sudden rebound or decline; however, given the RSI, a bounce may be probable.  Further analysis of the market and macroeconomic factors is necessary.

However, the projected long-term expected return remains positive.  Further investigation into the drivers of recent earnings volatility and the fluctuations in equity and ROE is necessary. A thorough analysis of macroeconomic factors and industry trends is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  Investors should consider their risk tolerance carefully.  The duplicated earnings data needs clarification.
