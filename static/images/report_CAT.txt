The long-term outlook, based on the provided expected return, remains positive relative to the S&P 500, but the short term presents some uncertainty.   Further analysis using up-to-date news, analyst reports, and a more comprehensive financial data set would provide a more complete and nuanced picture.  The reliance on limited historical data restricts the conclusion's robustness.
