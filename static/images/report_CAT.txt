**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha values (0.1) across all periods, suggesting CAT has outperformed the market.

The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values fluctuate, highlighting periods of significant price corrections.  It's important to note that a beta of 196 is unusually high and warrants further investigation regarding data accuracy.
