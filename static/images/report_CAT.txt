**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD (%) | Alpha | Beta  | Cap (B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| 2020-2022  | 102.0%   | 16.7%   | 104.0% | 1.0   | 111.1    |
| 2021-2023  | 76.0%    | 16.7%   | 67.0%  | 1.0   | 140.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 112.0%   | 16.7%   | 89.0%  | 1.0   | 174.5    |
| 2023-2025  | 110.0%   | 16.5%   | 68.0%  | 1.0   | 196.8    |

The consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and relatively low MDD (Maximum Drawdown) across all periods suggest strong performance and resilience.  A Beta of approximately 1.0 indicates that CAT's price movements are closely correlated with the overall market.  The high Alpha values imply significant outperformance relative to the market benchmark.  Note that Alpha is unusually high and requires further investigation into the methodology used to calculate it.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $407.63
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $398.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $372.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $382.22

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates recent stability.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 81.94  -  This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.59 - A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +10.2% - Indicates a recent short-term price increase.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 29.2% - This represents a substantial projected excess return compared to the S&P 500.  However, this prediction requires careful consideration of its underlying assumptions and inherent uncertainties. The small daily price change of $0.30 doesn't significantly alter the overall analysis; there is no evidence of a sudden surge or drop.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

CAT has demonstrated strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent earnings data show some inconsistencies, and technical indicators suggest the stock may be overbought.  The high expected return is promising, but this projection needs careful consideration given its inherent uncertainties.  Further investigation into the data discrepancies, particularly in earnings and financial data, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high Alpha values need to be independently verified to ensure accuracy of the calculations.  A comprehensive analysis should also include a consideration of macroeconomic factors and industry-specific risks.
