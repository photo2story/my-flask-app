The cumulative return for CAT is 208.78%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 114.28%.  The difference is 94.5%, placing it at the 70th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates a strong outperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $360.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $371.90
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $390.92
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $390.21

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (8.98):** Extremely oversold, indicating potential for a bounce.  However, this should be interpreted cautiously given the other indicators.
* **PPO (-1.077):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -6.8%, confirming a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 122.2%  This is a significantly higher expected return than the S&P 500, consistent with the historical outperformance.  However, future performance is not guaranteed.  The current price of $360.37, being below the moving averages, does not suggest immediate upward momentum.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent market outlook information was provided.  Therefore, no analysis of analyst opinions or performance highlights can be offered.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

CAT has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically.  However, current technical indicators (RSI, PPO, moving averages) suggest a short-term bearish trend. While the long-term outlook, based on the projected return, remains positive, the current price is below key moving averages, suggesting potential further downside.  Earnings show some recent volatility in both EPS and revenue, but neither demonstrates a clear upward or downward trend within the provided timeframe.  More information is needed regarding recent news and market sentiment for a more comprehensive assessment.  The extremely low RSI suggests a potential short-term reversal, but this should be treated with caution given the overall bearish sentiment indicated by the moving averages and PPO.
