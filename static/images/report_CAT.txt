CAT has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.

However, it's crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. The high beta suggests higher volatility, making careful risk management essential.  Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry is needed for a complete analysis.  Investors should consider their risk tolerance and long-term investment goals before making any investment decisions.
