**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI:  15.83 – This very low RSI suggests the stock is significantly oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity.
* PPO: -0.7534 – A negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, reinforcing the short-term downward trend.
* Recent Relative Strength Delta: -7.1 – A negative change in relative strength further confirms weakening performance against the S&P 500.
* Expected Return: 115.3% – This suggests significant potential for outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).

* EPS Trend: EPS has also declined sequentially over the last three quarters.
* Beats/Misses:  The data does not provide analyst estimates, so it’s impossible to determine whether these results were beats or misses. The repeated entry for 2023-11-01/2024-11-06 is likely an error and should be disregarded.
