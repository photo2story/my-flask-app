**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $381.5
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $383.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $388.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $376.46

The current price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a slight downward trend in the short term.  However, it is above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 52.95 –  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.48 – Suggests a bearish signal, indicating that the price momentum is weakening.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -6.36 – Shows a recent short-term downward trend.

The current price of $381.5 does not indicate a significant rapid upward or downward movement based solely on this data. Further analysis is needed.  The expected return of 10.75% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is significant, but again, not guaranteed.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The recent earnings reports show some fluctuation in EPS and revenue. While the revenue generally remains strong, the EPS shows some variability.  More context, including analyst estimates, is needed for a comprehensive evaluation.  The most recent EPS of $5.09 is below the previous quarter's $5.50.  A comparison to analyst expectations for the most recent quarter is missing and crucial for a proper assessment.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |

Financial performance is strong in terms of revenue and profit margins, although recent EPS figures show some fluctuation.  **A thorough analysis requires additional data, including the most recent earnings news, analyst estimates, and a comparison with industry peers.**  The provided expected long-term return is promising but should be considered cautiously due to inherent market risk and the lack of complete data.
