| 2018-2020  | -15.0% | 19.9% | -49.0% | 0.6 | 80.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 47.0% | 14.9% | -26.0% | 0.8 | 93.7 |
| 2020-2022  | 84.0% | 58.0% | 73.0% | 0.9 | 111.1 |
| 2021-2023  | 95.0% | 58.0% | 77.0% | 0.6 | 139.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 118.0% | 58.0% | 96.0% | 0.6 | 174.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 42.0% | 53.8% | 2.0% | 0.6 | 159.5 |

The table shows high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in most years, indicating strong historical growth.  The Alpha values suggest periods of outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha) relative to the benchmark market.  Beta generally hovers around 0.6-0.9, indicating moderate sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Market capitalization has steadily increased over the years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $330.43
* **Last Market Price:** $333.61
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $334.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $338.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $355.49

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The recent price increase from the previous close is a slight positive, but the overall trend appears bearish in the short-term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.51 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.0168 (Slightly bearish)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -1.8% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 51.7% (Significantly higher than the implied return of the S&P 500 benchmark)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest a potentially oversold condition and further downside risk. However, the positive expected return, considering the long-term investment horizon (2+ years), remains promising, especially considering the high historical alpha for longer time periods. The recent price increase of $0.92 does not appear significant enough to suggest any immediate dramatic shift.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 5.09 | $16.11B        |
| 2024-08-07 | 5.5  | $16.69B        |
| 2024-05-01 | 5.78 | $15.80B        |
| 2023-11-01 | 5.48 | $16.81B        |
| 2024-11-06 | 5.48 | $16.81B        |

There appears to be a duplicated entry for 2024-11-06.  Excluding the duplicate, EPS shows a slight decline in recent quarters, although revenue remains relatively stable around $16 billion.  Further investigation would be needed to understand the reasons behind the EPS fluctuation.

Equity and ROE show some fluctuation but remain generally strong, suggesting a healthy financial position.  The relatively high ROE indicates efficient use of shareholder capital.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

CAT has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500. While recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend, the long-term outlook appears positive, supported by a high expected return and generally strong financial performance.  However, the recent slight decline in EPS warrants further investigation.  The current medium-risk assessment should be considered alongside the indicators.  A long-term investment strategy, factoring in the potential volatility indicated by the beta, seems prudent given the company's historical performance and expected future returns.  Further due diligence, including a thorough examination of the company's competitive landscape, future growth prospects and potential risks, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
