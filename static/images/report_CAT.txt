*   **Weaknesses/Risks:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant volatility, short-term bearish signals (negative PPO, price below SMAs), potential short-term decline in share price, reliance on volatile sectors (construction/mining), and external risk such as interest rate, inflation and political influence.

The potential upside based on analyst target prices and the reported surge related to AI also reinforce the opportunity. However, the volatility, short-term bearish signals, and reliance on cyclical industries warrant careful risk management. Investors might consider a partial entry now and scaling in over time to manage risk.
