No news or market outlook is provided to inform this analysis.  Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also absent.  Information on recent earnings announcements (within the last two days) is necessary to complete this section.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

CAT has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  However, recent price action shows a decline, coupled with negative technical indicators (RSI and PPO) and a recent drop in relative performance.
