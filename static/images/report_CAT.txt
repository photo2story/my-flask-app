**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $353.32
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $356.90
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $375.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $377.27

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish short-term trend. The recent price change of -$0.11 indicates a slight decline.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 17.88 - This extremely low RSI suggests the stock is oversold and potentially due for a rebound.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.73 - Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -7.8% -  Indicates a recent downward trend.

The significant negative price change, coupled with the low RSI and negative PPO, points to a potentially oversold market condition, although further downward pressure is possible before any significant rebound.  The expectation of a long-term (2+ years) return of 39.9% above the S&P 500 is a strong positive indicator.
