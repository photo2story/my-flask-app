**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 64.30 –  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions, suggesting a relatively neutral short-term momentum.
* **PPO:** -0.11 –  Suggests slightly bearish momentum.  However, the relatively high RSI somewhat mitigates this.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.0 – Shows a recent slight decrease in relative strength against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 98.4% –  This suggests a significant long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500 if a buy-and-hold strategy is employed, assuming consistent future performance similar to the historical data.  The high expected return should be viewed cautiously. The provided data doesn't give a confidence level or margin of error associated with this value, and past performance is not indicative of future results.

The most recent quarter (2024-11-06) shows a decrease compared to the prior quarter (2024-08-07), but more data is needed to determine a trend.
