**1. Performance Comparison (CAT vs. VOO):**

Caterpillar Inc. is a leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment.  Over the analyzed period, CAT significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 217.57% compared to VOO's 119.91%.  The difference of 97.7% indicates substantial outperformance.  However, it's crucial to consider that this is a snapshot in time and past performance is not indicative of future results.  The relative outperformance metric (72.1%) suggests this level of outperformance is relatively high compared to the historical range, but not unprecedented.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different periods.  While alpha (excess return relative to the market) is generally positive, indicating outperformance, it fluctuates.  The beta (volatility relative to the market) is consistently above 1, suggesting higher volatility than the overall market.  This higher volatility contributes to both the higher returns and higher risk associated with CAT.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth over time.

A comprehensive due diligence process, including reviewing the company's financial statements and industry reports, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data needs to be clarified.
