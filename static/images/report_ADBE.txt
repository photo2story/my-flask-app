**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate demonstrates a wide range of performance, with very high growth in some periods and significant losses in others. Recent periods (2020-2025) show negative CAGR.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, representing excess return relative to the market, is strongly positive in earlier periods but turns negative in recent years, highlighting the underperformance. The substantial negative alpha values in the most recent periods suggest Adobe is significantly underperforming its expected return based on market movements.
*   **Beta:** Beta is increasing over time, suggesting that Adobe's stock is becoming more correlated with the market (S&P 500). This could imply that Adobe's stock is becoming more sensitive to overall market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated, reflecting changes in the company's valuation due to performance and market conditions.

**2) Stock Price Momentum**

*   **Close:** 343.13
*   **Last Market:** Price: 356.43, Previous Close: 350.43, Change: 1.71
*   **5-day SMA:** 340.31
*   **20-day SMA:** 327.80
*   **60-day SMA:** 340.37

**Analysis:**

*   The current price (356.43) is above the 5-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting short-term upward momentum.
*   The 5-day SMA is above the 60-day SMA indicating a possible short term bull trend.
*   The price is also above the 20-day SMA, indicating that the stock has been trending upward in the short term. The fact that the 20-day SMA is well below both the 5-day and 60-day suggest that this upward momentum is recent.

**3) Technical Indicators & Outlook**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 68.35
*   **PPO:** 1.05
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (6 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.9 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 2410.5%, Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A MRI of 0.8 indicates medium investment risk.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 68.35 suggests the stock is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70). This could signal a potential pullback or consolidation.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 1.05 is positive, suggesting a slightly bullish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal indicates a "Buy" recommendation, allocating 100% of available cash. This suggests that, according to this particular model, the stock is attractive at current levels, and that it is "Very Safe."
*   **Divergence Change:** The positive change in relative divergence suggests recent outperformance relative to its historical underperformance against the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The extraordinarily high expected return of 2410.5% is unrealistic and likely an anomaly in the model or data. It should be heavily discounted.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **AI-Driven Earnings:** Mixed reaction to Adobe's earnings beat, driven by AI initiatives.
*   **Analyst Doubt:** Concerns about Adobe's stock performance and potential for turnaround.
*   **OpenAI Partnership:** New partnership with OpenAI could be a positive catalyst.

*   **Target Price:** 436.05 (Avg) / 605.00 (High) / 270.00 (Low)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No rating changes shown in your data.

**Analysis:** Analysts generally have a "Buy" rating on Adobe, with an average price target significantly above the current price, suggesting upside potential. However, a wide range in price targets (270 to 605) indicates uncertainty.

**7) Comprehensive Summary**

Adobe (ADBE) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, and the recent periods demonstrate negative Alpha. The technical indicators suggest a potential near-term overbought condition. However, analyst consensus remains a "Buy," with significant upside potential based on average price targets. Recent earnings show positive trends in both EPS and revenue. Adobe boasts exceptionally high and stable profit margins. The news flow points to mixed sentiment, with excitement around AI initiatives offset by concerns about overall stock performance.  The OpenAI partnership is a potential positive catalyst. Decreasing equity, coupled with rising ROE, suggest effective capital management. While the model suggests a "Very Safe" investment, the high expected return is unrealistic.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data presents a mixed picture. Adobe's recent underperformance and high volatility are concerning. However, strong underlying financial performance (revenue growth, high profit margins), positive analyst sentiment, and potential catalysts (OpenAI partnership) suggest that Adobe might be a worthwhile investment for investors with long-term outlooks. *However*, it's crucial to be aware of the risks associated with potential overbought conditions and ongoing market uncertainty. More research into the reasons for the stock's recent underperformance is recommended before making an investment decision. The "Very Safe" investment rating by the Hybrid Signal should be taken with a grain of salt, given the volatility and underperformance metrics.
