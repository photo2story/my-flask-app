**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $516.26 (Last Market: $534.41)  Note the recent slight price drop.
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $517.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $510.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $509.02

The price is currently trading slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting some short-term downward pressure.  However, it remains above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a relatively stronger longer-term trend.  The last market price of $534.41, higher than the closing price, points to a recent decline.  While not a "sharp" drop, it does reflect some short-term volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 43.59 - This suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory (below 50), indicating potential buying opportunities for some investors.  However, RSI alone is not sufficient to make investment decisions.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.21 - A positive value indicates upward momentum, but the magnitude is relatively small.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** NaN (-) â€“  The missing data prevents a conclusive analysis of recent relative divergence.
* **Expected Return:** 493.7% - This represents a significant expected long-term (2+ years) outperformance against the S&P 500.  This high expectation should be viewed with caution, as it relies on assumptions and historical data which may not accurately reflect future performance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has shown strong long-term growth significantly outpacing the S&P 500.  However, recent quarters demonstrate volatility in both revenue and earnings, particularly a significant drop in Q1 2024 EPS.  While technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term rebound, the high expected return needs to be viewed cautiously.  Further investigation into the causes of the Q1 2024 dip in EPS and clarification on the duplicate data points are crucial for a complete assessment.  Accessing recent news and analyst opinions is essential for a fully informed investment decision.  The high Beta suggests significant market sensitivity, emphasizing the need to carefully consider broader economic factors.
