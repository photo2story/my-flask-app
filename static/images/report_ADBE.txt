Despite this, the RSI and PPO indicators suggest that the stock may be undervalued and poised for a potential rebound. The recent relative divergence change and 7-day Rank change also indicate a potential upward trend. However, the company's earnings performance and revenue growth have been inconsistent, with a decline in the recent quarter. Overall, the analysis suggests that investors should exercise caution when considering Adobe Inc as an investment opportunity.
