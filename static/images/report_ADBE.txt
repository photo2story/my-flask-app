**7. 종합 Analysis:**

ADBE exhibits a mixed outlook. While recent stock performance has lagged the S&P 500, and short-term technical indicators suggest a potential downtrend, the company's financial health appears strong. Revenue and profit margins are robust, and earnings have generally been increasing.

However, several factors warrant caution:

*   **Underperformance:** The underperformance relative to the S&P 500 needs to be carefully considered.
*   **Analyst Target Price:** The wide range in analyst price targets reveals uncertainty about the stock's future value.
*   **Equity Decrease:** The decrease in equity over recent quarters could be a concern.

**Recommendation:**

The Hybrid Signal indicates a "Buy," and the MRI suggests low risk. The very high "Expected Return" is attractive. However, one must consider the recent news, including analyst price target reductions and negative articles, the short-term technical weakness, and the underperformance vs. the S&P 500. The recommendation is to take a **Cautious Buy**, considering that the recent price move is down move from previous days.
