| 2016-2018  | 50.0% | 69.2% | 29.0% | 0.1 | 96.4 |
| 2017-2019  | 82.0% | 69.2% | 48.0% | 0.5 | 140.6 |
| 2018-2020  | 105.0% | 70.0% | 75.0% | 0.3 | 213.2 |

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $348.80
* **5-day Moving Average:** $349.35
* **20-day Moving Average:** $368.80
* **60-day Moving Average:** $413.96

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent increase of $1.34 from the previous close shows a slight positive change, but needs further observation to understand if this is a start of an upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 32.49 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.0468 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.9 (Short-term upward momentum)

The relatively low RSI suggests the stock may be oversold, but the negative PPO and the fact the price is below its moving averages suggest caution.  The recent price increase of $1.34 from the previous close could be interpreted as a small bounce.  The expected return of 227.9% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a significant projection and needs further scrutiny of the underlying methodology.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2025-03-26 | $4.15  | $5.71 B      |
| 2024-09-25 | $3.78  | $5.41 B      |
| 2024-06-26 | $3.50  | $5.31 B      |
| 2024-03-27 | $1.37  | $5.18 B      |
| 2025-03-26 | $1.37  | $5.18 B      |

There's a duplicated entry for March 26, 2025.  Assuming this is an error, the data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue, with a significant jump in EPS in the March 2025 quarter.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reason behind the EPS increase in Q1 2025 compared to Q4 2024.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|

| 2024-11-30 | $5.61B | 89.01%       |
| 2024-08-31 | $5.41B | 89.76%       |
| 2024-05-31 | $5.31B | 88.74%       |
| 2024-02-29 | $5.18B | 88.61%       |

Revenue shows consistent growth, and profit margins remain high and relatively stable.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-02-28 | $13.10B | 13.83% |
| 2024-11-30 | $14.11B | 11.93% |
| 2024-08-31 | $14.54B | 11.58% |
| 2024-05-31 | $14.84B | 10.60% |
| 2024-02-29 | $15.46B | 4.01% |

Equity decreased slightly over the period, while ROE shows some fluctuation but generally remains healthy, except for a significant drop in Q1 2024, requiring further investigation.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

ADBE has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong revenue and profit growth.  However, the current price is below its moving averages, and some technical indicators suggest caution.  While the long-term outlook remains positive given the company's strong fundamentals and high projected returns, investors should monitor the recent price action and evaluate the reasons behind the fluctuations in ROE and the significant EPS jump before making any investment decisions. The projected long-term return needs further justification and should not be taken as a guaranteed outcome.  Further analysis of the duplicated data entry in the earnings report is necessary.
