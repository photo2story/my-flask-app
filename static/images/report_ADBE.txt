## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Stock Performance Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Adobe Inc. is a multinational computer software company.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  While Adobe has shown impressive growth in previous years (as indicated by high CAGRs), recent performance has been significantly weaker.  Further analysis is required to determine the reasons behind this downturn.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **ADBE Cumulative Return:** 55.82%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 89.83%
* **Return Difference:** -34.01%  (ADBE underperformed VOO by 34.01%)
* **Relative Divergence:** 3% (This indicates that the current underperformance relative to the S&P 500 sits at the 3rd percentile of historical divergences, suggesting relatively low underperformance compared to past instances, although still negative).

The Alpha and Beta values in the provided table indicate periods of both outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative CAGR and Alpha) against the market, emphasizing the cyclical nature of Adobe's performance. The high Beta values indicate significant market sensitivity.  The massive drop in CAGR from 2019-2021 to 2022-2024 is notable and warrants further investigation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $383.53
* **Last Market Price:** $380.73 (a decrease of $0.73 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $393.37
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $409.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $428.84

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The recent price drop of $0.73, while not significant on its own, reinforces the bearish signal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 31.99 (Suggests oversold conditions, potentially indicating a bounce but not necessarily a bullish reversal)
* **PPO:** -0.25 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.7 (Indicates recent weakening relative to the market)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 6441.1% This incredibly high expected return requires careful scrutiny. The data source and methodology for this calculation need verification as this number seems unrealistic and potentially erroneous.

The current price action shows a small but consistent decrease reflecting the bearish trend.  More analysis of the driving factors behind the high expected return is needed.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Adobe's recent performance has been disappointing compared to the S&P 500. While the company shows strong revenue and profit margin consistency,  the significant underperformance relative to the market (and the questionable 6441.1% expected return), coupled with bearish technical indicators and fluctuating EPS, raise concerns.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance, clarification on the duplicate earnings data entry, and validation of the expected return calculation are crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The high Beta suggests significant market sensitivity, making it vulnerable to broader market downturns.  A thorough examination of the macroeconomic environment and competitive landscape is necessary to assess the long-term outlook for ADBE.
