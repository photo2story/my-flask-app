* **5-day Moving Average:** $448.53
* **20-day Moving Average:** $503.69
* **60-day Moving Average:** $500.66

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 29.44 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce back is possible.

It is crucial to establish realistic expectations, even with long-term investment.  Given the current price and negative PPO, this figure likely requires further investigation to justify its accuracy. The 447.17 price is not necessarily reflecting a sharp rebound or decline on its own; it needs context with the price momentum and overall market sentiment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has shown strong long-term growth, outperforming the S&P 500 in the provided period. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downtrend.

Further investigation is needed into the fluctuating EPS and ROE, particularly the significant drop in Q1 2024.  Additional data regarding market outlook and analyst sentiment would provide a more holistic assessment. The provided data is insufficient to make definitive conclusions beyond indicating potential long-term growth prospects and the possibility of a short-term price correction.  Analyzing future earnings reports and relevant news articles is crucial for a thorough investment evaluation.
