ADBE has historically shown strong performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.

The projected long-term excess return should be treated with caution.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the Q1 2024 dip in both earnings and ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Consider consulting with a financial advisor before investing.
