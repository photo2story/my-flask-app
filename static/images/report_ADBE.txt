**Analysis:**

*   **Underperformance:** ADBE has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently.
*   **Alpha & Beta:** The Alpha values show that Adobe's performance relative to the market has been highly variable. The Beta values, steadily increasing over time, indicate that ADBE is becoming more sensitive to market movements. Notably, recent years have seen negative Alpha, indicating underperformance relative to the market, even accounting for market risk.
*   **CAGR and MDD:** High historical CAGR figures demonstrate strong growth in some periods, but recent negative CAGR values highlight challenges. High MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures across all periods indicate significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Cap(B):** This appears to be market capitalization, and the trend shows significant growth over time, peaking around 2021 and declining in recent years, potentially related to market conditions and company performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 353.80
*   **Last Market:** price 353.80, previousClose 352.98, change 0.23
*   **5-day SMA:** 354.52
*   **20-day SMA:** 345.31
*   **60-day SMA:** 339.29

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA, above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a recent uptrend, but it might be losing momentum in the very short term. The "change" of 0.23 indicates a relatively small daily price movement.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 57.32 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.19 (Positive, indicating a slight uptrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (6 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -0.2 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 495.7% (Long-term)

**Analysis:**

*   **Conflicting Signals:** While the MRI suggests high investment, the recent divergence change indicates a short-term decline.
*   **High Expected Return:** The projected 495.7% expected return is very high and should be treated with caution. It represents a model's prediction based on certain assumptions.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Very Safe" designation seems optimistic considering other indicators, and the MRI itself is not a guarantee of safety. The small monthly investment suggestion is cautious.
