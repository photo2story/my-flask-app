2024-12-31 - Analysis Report
## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Adobe Inc. is a multinational computer software company specializing in creative multimedia software.  The cumulative return of ADBE is 121.61%, exceeding the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 115.96% by 5.64 percentage points.  This places the stock's relative outperformance at the 3.6th percentile based on historical data (max: 236.2%, min: -3.0%). While this is a positive outcome, the relative performance should be viewed in the context of its historical variability.  The provided Alpha and Beta values suggest the stock has consistently outperformed the market (positive Alpha) but carries higher risk (high Beta).  Note that the significantly negative CAGR for 2020-2022 and 2022-2024 highlights periods of substantial underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $445.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $447.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $486.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $495.52

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 11.97 – This indicates the stock is significantly oversold.
* **PPO:** -0.91 – This suggests negative momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.1 – Shows a minor upward shift in relative strength recently.

The combination of low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the price being below its moving averages, points towards bearish momentum.  However, the recent slight increase in relative divergence might suggest a potential near-term rebound, although not necessarily a strong one given that the current price is not far from its recent lows.  A notable spike to 445.80 wouldn't significantly alter this interpretation as it only shows a temporary reversal and not a longer-term shift in sentiment. The extremely high expected return of 2279.8% over the long term (2+ years) seems unrealistic and likely reflects limitations in the calculation, and thus should be regarded with extreme caution.
