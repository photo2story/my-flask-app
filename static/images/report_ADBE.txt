**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.08)
*   **Target Price (Avg/High/Low):** 430.96 / 605.00 / 270.00

**Analysis:**  Analysts generally have a positive outlook on Adobe, but the wide range in target prices suggests uncertainty.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Adobe is at a crossroads. Its stock has underperformed the broader market, and its recent financial performance (reflected in negative CAGR and alpha in recent periods) is concerning. While the technical indicators show a potential short-term bounce, the RSI suggests it might be overbought.

The news is a mixed bag. Positive analyst coverage is countered by concerns about increasing AI competition and potential disruption. The analyst consensus is still "Buy" with a significant upside target, but the wide range suggests a lack of strong conviction. The key risk appears to be the potential impact of AI on Adobe's competitive position. The recent news headlines are worth to be followed.

The high "Expected Return" is unrealistic and should be disregarded. The market risk indicator places it in the Medium Investment category, but the overbought RSI and high MDD indicate the need to proceed with caution.
