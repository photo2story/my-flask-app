* **20-day Moving Average:** $380.15
* **60-day Moving Average:** $421.41

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend. The significant drop from the previous close suggests potential downward pressure.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE shows a history of strong performance relative to the S&P 500, with high CAGR in many periods.  However, recent price action indicates a bearish short-term trend.  While the RSI suggests potential for a rebound from oversold conditions, the negative PPO and below-average moving averages signal continued downward pressure. The high expected return suggests a positive long-term outlook, but careful consideration of the current market conditions and the recent price drop is necessary.  Further investigation is needed to clarify the duplicated data point in the earnings report and to analyze the reasons behind the recent decline in ROE.  A long-term investor might consider accumulating shares at this point, but thorough due diligence is warranted.
