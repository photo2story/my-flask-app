## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

ADBE's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) by 47.8 percentage points.  While this is a strong relative performance, the relative divergence of 26.5% suggests its outperformance is within a historically observed range.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Adobe Inc. is a multinational computer software company.  The cumulative return of ADBE (130.32%) substantially exceeds that of the S&P 500 (VOO) (82.57%).  The difference (47.8%) places it in the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a varying degree of outperformance (Alpha) relative to the market (Beta). Notably,  while showing positive alpha in most years, 2022-2024 exhibits a significant negative CAGR and a large maximum drawdown (MDD), suggesting vulnerability during market downturns.  The consistently high Beta across the periods indicates strong market sensitivity.  Market capitalization (Cap) shows significant growth over the period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 360.91
* **5-day MA:** 350.96
* **20-day MA:** 359.94
* **60-day MA:** 408.16

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **MRI:** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 46.98 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.66 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return:** 237.5% (This is a very high expected return and needs further justification and context.  The timeframe of "2 years or more" is also important to consider.)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests potential for a bounce, the price action and moving averages point to a short-term bearish trend.  The high expected return requires significant scrutiny and clarification of the underlying assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue    |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-03-26 | 4.15 | 5.71 B$     |
| 2024-09-25 | 3.78 | 5.41 B$     |
| 2024-06-26 | 3.5  | 5.31 B$     |
| 2024-03-27 | 1.37 | 5.18 B$     |
| 2025-03-26 | 1.37 | 5.18 B$     |

There appears to be a duplication of data for March 26th, 2025.  Excluding the duplicate, the data shows a consistent increase in both EPS and revenue over the past year, indicating strong growth.  However, a more detailed analysis is needed to assess profitability and growth sustainability.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis. This critical information is necessary to properly evaluate the company's financial health and performance.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent price action suggests a short-term bearish trend.  While long-term growth potential is indicated by earnings data (although more financial data is necessary), the high expected return requires deeper justification. The company exhibits high market sensitivity (high Beta), making it susceptible to market downturns.  A more thorough analysis including missing financial data and a justification of the projected return are essential before making investment decisions.  The apparent data duplication also warrants investigation.
