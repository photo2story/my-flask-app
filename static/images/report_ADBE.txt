*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 60.12

*   The MRI of 0.9 suggests the stock is considered a Medium Investment Recommended.
*   The RSI of 60.12 is nearing overbought territory (above 70), implying that the stock *could* be due for a correction, but is not yet definitive.
*   The PPO being slightly negative suggests short-term downward momentum, but it's close to zero, so the signal is weak.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a buy recommendation with a fully invested strategy, indicating confidence based on its risk assessment.
*   The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days supports the idea of a recent short-term decline.
*   The extraordinarily high Expected Return of 617.4% should be viewed with extreme skepticism. Such returns are highly unlikely and potentially indicative of optimistic modelling or a calculation error. It suggests that *if* current underperformance reverses, significant gains are possible over the long term.
