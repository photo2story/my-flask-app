    *   **CAGR:** Shows strong growth in earlier periods (2015-2021), but significant declines in more recent years.
    *   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values across all periods indicate significant volatility and risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Early periods showed substantial positive alpha, indicating outperformance relative to the market. However, recent years show strongly negative alpha, meaning underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** Beta has generally increased over time, suggesting that Adobe's stock has become more correlated with the market (S&P 500) and more sensitive to market movements. A Beta above 0.5 suggests moderate to high correlation.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Cap (Billions) fluctuates with stock performance, illustrating the impact of market conditions on Adobe's valuation.

*   **Analysis:** The price is currently above both the 20-day and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating a short-term upward trend.
