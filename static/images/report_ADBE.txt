## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

ADBE's cumulative return (114.52%) underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.63%.  The difference is -6.1%, placing it in the 2.1st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  This suggests that while ADBE has shown significant growth, it has lagged behind the broader market recently.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Adobe Inc. is a multinational computer software company.

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows varying performance against the market (likely the S&P 500) across different time periods.  High CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values in some periods (e.g., 2017-2019, 2018-2020) indicate strong growth, while others (2020-2022, 2022-2024) reflect significant declines.  The increasing beta values suggest increasing market sensitivity over time.  Alpha values are mostly positive but vary significantly, suggesting periods of outperformance and underperformance compared to market benchmarks.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) generally increased throughout these periods, except during periods of negative CAGR.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 80.0% | 2.2% | 52.0% | 0.1 | 76.3 |
| 2016-2018  | 85.0% | 9.0% | 67.0% | 0.1 | 98.5 |
| 2017-2019  | 125.0% | 9.0% | 94.0% | 0.5 | 143.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 143.0% | 9.0% | 115.0% | 0.2 | 217.9 |
| 2019-2021  | 134.0% | 15.0% | 64.0% | 0.2 | 247.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -76.0% | 26.0% | -85.0% | 0.2 | 146.6 |
| 2021-2023  | 6.0% | 26.0% | -18.0% | 1.0 | 259.9 |
| 2022-2024  | -104.0% | 26.0% | -137.0% | 1.0 | 193.7 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $435.40
* **Last Market Price:** $435.80 (Slight increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $437.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $431.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $470.02

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The 60-day moving average indicates a more significant decline from recent highs.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 60.22  - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.57 -  A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** -2.3% - Indicates a short-term bearish trend.

The small price increase in the `Last-market` data doesn't indicate a significant change, and does not qualify as a rapid surge or decline.

* **Expected Return:** 3902.8% - This extremely high expected return (over 2 years) compared to the S&P 500 is unrealistic and requires further scrutiny. The methodology for calculating this figure needs to be clarified and validated.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility. EPS (Earnings Per Share) increased significantly in Q2 2024 and Q3 2024 compared to Q1 2024 but shows volatility in other quarters. Revenue has shown a generally increasing trend.  A more thorough analysis would require examining year-over-year growth rates and comparing performance to analyst expectations.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-09-25 | 3.78 | $5.41 B     |
| 2024-06-26 | 3.5  | $5.31 B     |
| 2024-03-27 | 1.37 | $5.18 B     |
| 2023-09-27 | 3.07 | $4.89 B     |
| 2024-09-25 | 3.07 | $4.89 B     | *(Duplicate entry - likely an error)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profit margin show a consistently strong and slightly increasing trend over the provided period.  Equity shows some fluctuation, and ROE (Return on Equity) also varies, with a significant drop in Q1 2024. This requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-11-30 | $5.61B | 89.01% |
| 2024-08-31 | $5.41B | 89.76% |
| 2024-05-31 | $5.31B | 88.74% |
| 2024-02-29 | $5.18B | 88.61% |
| 2023-11-30 | $5.05B | 87.44% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-11-30 | $14.11B | 11.93% |
| 2024-08-31 | $14.54B | 11.58% |
| 2024-05-31 | $14.84B | 10.60% |
| 2024-02-29 | $15.46B | 4.01% |
| 2023-11-30 | $16.52B | 8.98% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE shows strong revenue and profitability but has recently underperformed the S&P 500. The recent price action suggests a potential downward trend, although technical indicators offer a mixed picture.  The provided expected return is highly questionable and needs clarification.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the variations in ROE and the significant drop in Q1 2024 is crucial.  Further analysis of year-over-year growth rates and comparison to industry benchmarks would provide a more comprehensive assessment.  The highly variable alpha and beta values across different time periods suggest a need for a more nuanced understanding of the company's risk profile and market sensitivity.  The provided data needs further investigation to draw strong conclusions about the company's future performance.
