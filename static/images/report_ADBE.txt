**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Adobe Inc. is a multinational computer software company specializing in the creation and distribution of multimedia and creativity software.

The cumulative return of ADBE is 171.89%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 120.40%.  ADBE outperformed VOO by 51.5 percentage points.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, places ADBE at the 22.8th percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates that while ADBE significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in this period, it's not at an extreme high point of its historical relative performance.

The provided CAGR data shows significant year-over-year fluctuations, highlighting the volatility of the tech sector and ADBE's sensitivity to market conditions.  Note the substantial negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2022-2024.  The high beta consistently above 78 indicates a strong correlation with overall market movements.  Alpha remains consistently around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance relative to the market but not significantly large.
