## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Investment Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Adobe Inc. is a multinational computer software company specializing in multimedia and creativity software.

The cumulative return of ADBE is 121.05%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 115.09%.  ADBE outperformed VOO by 6.0 percentage points.  The relative outperformance is at the 3.8th percentile based on historical data, suggesting it's performed better than a significant portion of its past performance history relative to the S&P 500 but not exceptionally so.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows considerable variability in ADBE's CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) over the years.  While alpha consistently remains around 0.1, indicating slight outperformance, beta is significantly higher than 1 in some periods, suggesting higher volatility than the market.  The recent years show significantly negative returns (2020-2024), a notable risk factor.  Market capitalization increased significantly from 2015 to 2021 before declining.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $444.68
* **Last Market Price:** $441.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $447.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $482.68
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $494.47

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend.  The difference between the closing price and last market price is minimal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 11.95 – This extremely low RSI suggests the stock is oversold and potentially ripe for a bounce, but it could also indicate further downside.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.72 –  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.0 – Indicates short-term upward momentum despite the overall downtrend.  This is a short term trend only.

* **Expected Return:** 2151.3% – This extremely high figure requires further clarification as to its methodology and assumptions.  It is not credible without further context. Given the other indicators, this number seems extremely unrealistic.

The significant gap between the closing and last market price ($444.68 vs $441.77) is not significant enough to indicate a sudden jump or drop.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The data reveals a mixed bag in recent quarters:

* **Revenue:** Shows consistent growth, albeit at a slowing pace in the most recent quarter (Q4 2024).
* **EPS:**  Fluctuated significantly. There's a notable drop in EPS from Q2 2024 ($3.50) to Q3 2024 ($1.37), followed by a strong increase in Q4 2024 ($3.78).  Without knowing the expectations, it's impossible to determine whether these were beats or misses.  Note there is duplicated data for Sept 25th, 2024.
* **Overall:** Without expectations, there's no definitive assessment of the earnings performance. The revenue growth is positive, but EPS volatility is a concern.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue has steadily grown, and profit margins have remained consistently high, fluctuating slightly between 87% and 89%.  This is excellent profitability.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity fluctuates, but ROE (Return on Equity) has shown some volatility.  The significant drop in ROE in Q2 2024 (4.01%) is noteworthy and requires further investigation.  The overall trend suggests reasonably solid returns on equity, but again, volatility is a present risk.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has shown periods of strong growth and outperformance relative to the S&P 500 but is currently experiencing a downturn.  Technical indicators (RSI, PPO) point towards bearish momentum, while the recent price movement is below its moving averages.  The extremely high expected return is questionable and demands further investigation. Earnings show good revenue growth but volatile EPS.  Profitability is excellent, but equity and ROE show some volatility, making the current risk profile high.  Further analysis using the missing news, analyst opinions, and expected earnings is crucial before making investment decisions.
