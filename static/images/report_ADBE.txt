Adobe Inc. (ADBE) is a multinational computer software company specializing in the creation and distribution of multimedia and creativity software.  The cumulative return of ADBE is 188.1%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%.  The difference is 59.2%, placing it at the 21.7th percentile of its historical range of outperformance against the S&P 500 (max: 278.9%, min: -1.7%). This indicates ADBE has generally outperformed the market over the period considered, but this outperformance isn't at its historical peak.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows that ADBE consistently exhibited a positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and a beta greater than 1 (higher volatility than the market) over the years 2015-2021.  However, recent years (2022-2024) show a decline in performance and a negative CAGR, along with increased maximum drawdown (MDD). This suggests potential increased risk in recent times.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +2.6 (Indicates short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** 486.9% (This is a high projected return.  It's crucial to understand the assumptions and limitations behind this projection.  High expected returns often come with higher risks.)

Given that the last market price (513.51) is very close to the closing price, there's no significant indication of a sudden price jump or drop.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong revenue and profit margin growth. However, recent quarters show some signs of slowing growth in EPS and slight volatility in profitability.  The price is relatively stable near its moving averages. The high expected return requires careful consideration of the underlying assumptions and inherent risks.  Further investigation into recent news and analyst sentiment is necessary to form a complete picture.  The high beta suggests the stock is more volatile than the overall market.
