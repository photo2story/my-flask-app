*   **5-day SMA:** 348.55
*   **20-day SMA:** 348.97
*   **60-day SMA:** 339.31

**Analysis:**  The stock price is below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downtrend. The recent price drop of 4.77% from the previous close confirms this.

**3. Technical Indicators and Signals:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 33.26 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.48

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 319.8%

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI indicates that ADBE is currently in oversold territory, which could suggest a potential buying opportunity.
*   The PPO is negative, implying the 12-day exponential moving average is below the 26-day exponential moving average, further supporting the downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal recommends buying based on a "very safe" assessment with an MRI of 0.90 (contradictory to the overall MRI), which appears to be based on a different, potentially historical, data point.
*   The "Recent relative divergence change" indicates a recent upward movement, contrasting with the current price decline.
*   The very high "Expected Return" seems optimistic but may reflect the potential for a rebound from the current depressed levels.

*   **Positive Sentiment:**
    *   "Are Strong Financial Prospects The Force That Is Driving The Momentum In Adobe Inc.'s NASDAQ:ADBE) Stock?"

**Analysis:** Recent news presents a mixed picture. While some articles highlight strong financial prospects and AI leadership, others focus on the stock's recent underperformance and suggest a sell-off.  The Piper Sandler reaffirmation of an "Outperform" rating is a positive sign, however.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** None
*   **Mean Recommendation:** - (No data)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 36
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 430.96 / 605.00 / 270.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No data

**Analysis:** With target prices ranging widely from 270 to 605, analysts have largely un-agreed opinions of Adobe's future.  The average target price of 430.96 suggests potential upside from the current price of 333.30.  The lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to gauge current sentiment shifts.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-09-24 | 4.18 | 5.99 B$     |

| 2025-09-24 | 3.78 | 5.41 B$     |

**Analysis:** EPS and Revenue have shown overall growth in recent quarters.  The duplicate data point (2025-09-24 and 2024-09-25 having the same EPS and Revenue) should be investigated for accuracy. The trend is upwards, with EPS increasing from 3.78 to 4.18 and Revenue rising from 5.41B to 5.99B.

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is steadily increasing, and Adobe maintains an extremely high profit margin, indicating strong pricing power and efficient operations.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has decreased in the last few quarters, potentially due to share buybacks or dividend payouts. ROE has increased, suggesting that Adobe is becoming more efficient in generating profit from its equity.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Adobe is currently facing mixed signals. While the company exhibits strong fundamentals (high profit margins, growing revenue), recent stock performance has been poor, significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold and potentially poised for a rebound. Analyst opinions, however, are varied, and the news sentiment is also mixed.

**Key Takeaways:**

*   **Underperformance:**  ADBE has underperformed the market.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators suggest a possible rebound, while news sentiment is mixed.
*   **Strong Fundamentals:**  High profit margins and growing revenue indicate a healthy underlying business.
*   **Risk:**  High Beta and recent MDD indicate higher-than-average risk.
*   **Oversold:** RSI indicates the stock may be oversold and could be a buying opportunity
*   **High Expected Return:** The "Expected Return" figure is very high and should be interpreted cautiously, but points to belief in long-term value.

**Overall Recommendation:** Given the conflicting signals, a neutral stance is warranted. The oversold conditions and potential for a rebound make ADBE interesting, but the recent underperformance and mixed news sentiment require caution. Investors should carefully weigh the risks and rewards before making any investment decisions. The financial data suggests that Adobe may be a worthwhile investment in the long term, however.
