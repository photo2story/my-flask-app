## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Adobe Inc. is a multinational computer software company best known for its flagship products, Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud.

The cumulative return of ADBE is 115.95%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 120.36%.  Therefore, ADBE underperformed VOO by 4.4 percentage points at the end of the period.  The relative underperformance, considering historical volatility, places it at the 2.8th percentile (meaning it has underperformed in the bottom 2.8% of historical observations compared to the S&P 500).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (as measured by Beta), with periods of significant outperformance and underperformance. The relatively stable Beta (around 0.1) suggests low correlation with the overall market, but the highly variable CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and large Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) highlight substantial risk.  The consistently positive alpha (0.1) suggests some level of outperformance relative to the market risk, however, the recent negative CAGR significantly impacts this interpretation.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $436.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $424.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $432.45
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $479.53

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price change of +$1.48 (approximately +0.34%) indicates a minor upward movement, but it's not enough to overcome the longer-term downward trend illustrated by the moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 42.99 – This indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory (below 30 is generally considered oversold), suggesting a potential bounce but not confirming an upward trend.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.62 – A positive value suggests some bullish momentum, but it's relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.4 – This shows a short-term upward movement in relative performance against the S&P 500.  This short-term improvement does not fully offset the longer-term underperformance.
* **Expected Return:** 2929.5% – This extremely high expected return over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 needs further clarification regarding the methodology used to arrive at this figure. It seems unrealistic and warrants significant skepticism.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistency. While revenue shows steady growth, EPS is volatile.  The significant drop in EPS between Q1 2024 and Q2 2024, followed by a recovery in Q3 2024, points to potential underlying factors affecting profitability that require further investigation.  A duplicate entry exists for September 25th, 2024, which needs clarification.


| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-09-25 | 3.78    | $5.41B       |
| 2024-06-26 | 3.5     | $5.31B       |
| 2024-03-27 | 1.37    | $5.18B       |
| 2023-09-27 | 3.07    | $4.89B       |
| 2024-09-25 | 3.07    | $4.89B       | *(Duplicate Entry)*


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows strong revenue growth and consistently high profit margins, indicating a healthy and profitable business. However, equity has been declining recently, and ROE (Return on Equity) is volatile. The significant drop in ROE during Q1 2024 requires explanation.


| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin | Equity   | ROE     |
|------------|----------|---------------|----------|---------|
| 2024-11-30 | $5.61B   | 89.01%        | $14.11B  | 11.93%  |
| 2024-08-31 | $5.41B   | 89.76%        | $14.54B  | 11.58%  |
| 2024-05-31 | $5.31B   | 88.74%        | $14.84B  | 10.60%  |
| 2024-02-29 | $5.18B   | 88.61%        | $15.46B  | 4.01%   |
| 2023-11-30 | $5.05B   | 87.44%        | $16.52B  | 8.98%   |



**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE exhibits a mixed performance.  While possessing strong revenue growth and high profit margins, the stock has recently underperformed the S&P 500, showing some volatility in earnings and ROE. The technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce, but the longer-term trend needs further monitoring.  The extremely high projected return requires thorough investigation and validation before any reliance on this data.  More detailed analysis, including industry comparison and macroeconomic factors, is needed for a comprehensive assessment. The duplicate data entry and volatile EPS require further clarification. The provided long-term expected return seems drastically inflated and unreliable.
