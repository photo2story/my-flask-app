**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downtrend.

The high projected long-term return should be viewed with caution.  Further investigation is recommended into the reasons for the Q1 2024 EPS and equity drop, and the duplication in the earnings data should be addressed before drawing definitive conclusions.  A comprehensive analysis requires additional data and a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and market conditions.
