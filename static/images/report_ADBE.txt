* **5-Day Moving Average:** $461.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $444.70

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (67.13):**  Approaching overbought territory (generally above 70).  Suggests potential for a short-term pullback.
* **PPO (0.90):** Positive value indicates upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+1.6%):** Confirms a short-term uptrend.
* **Price Change (Last Market):**  A positive change of 0.86% suggests a minor upward movement.  Not a significant surge.
* **Expected Return (1064.1%):** This extremely high figure requires further clarification regarding the methodology and assumptions used to calculate it.  It is likely unrealistic without substantial justification.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  There's a noticeable dip in EPS and revenue in Q1 2024 (March 27th), followed by an increase in subsequent quarters.  Duplicate data entry for September 25th, 2024 needs correction.  A more detailed analysis requires additional data and context (e.g., industry comparisons, macroeconomic factors).

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-09-25 | 3.78 | $5.41 B       |
| 2024-06-26 | 3.5  | $5.31 B       |
| 2024-03-27 | 1.37 | $5.18 B       |
| 2023-09-27 | 3.07 | $4.89 B       |
| **2024-09-25** | **3.07** | **$4.89 B** | *(Duplicate entry - needs correction)*


**5) Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profit margins have shown consistent growth over the past five quarters.  Equity has fluctuated but ROE shows some instability, notably a significant drop in Q1 2024 before rebounding again.  This suggests a need to further investigate the causes of the significant Q1 2024 drop in ROE.

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|------------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-11-30 | $5.61B     | 89.01%        | $14.11      | 11.93   |
| 2024-08-31 | $5.41B     | 89.76%        | $14.54      | 11.58   |
| 2024-05-31 | $5.31B     | 88.74%        | $14.84      | 10.60   |
| 2024-02-29 | $5.18B     | 88.61%        | $15.46      | 4.01    |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Adobe (ADBE) has shown strong performance relative to the S&P 500, with a higher cumulative return.  However, the provided alpha and beta data needs to be verified as the beta values of 0 are implausible.  Recent price movements indicate a short-term uptrend, supported by technical indicators like PPO. The RSI suggests potential for a short-term correction.  Earnings show some volatility but generally positive trends in revenue and profit margins. The ROE shows some instability that needs investigation. The extraordinarily high projected return needs significant further support.  A more comprehensive analysis requires reviewing the data quality, addressing inconsistencies, and incorporating additional factors.  The provided data alone does not provide a complete picture of Adobe's financial health and future prospects.
