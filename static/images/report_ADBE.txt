*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR was strong from 2015-2021. Recent periods (2020-2025) show significant negative growth, indicating poor performance in the last few years.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  MDD is consistently high across all periods, showing significant price volatility. While the MDD numbers are similar, it's important to note that a 80% drawdown on a smaller base capital is much less impactful than an 80% drawdown on a larger capital.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the stock's performance relative to the market. Positive Alpha indicates outperformance; negative Alpha indicates underperformance. ADBE shows strong positive alpha up to the 2019-2021 period, and significant negative alpha in recent periods.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A beta of 1 indicates volatility similar to the market. A beta greater than 1 suggests the stock is more volatile than the market. ADBE's beta has been increasing, indicating the stock is becoming more volatile compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization is in Billions. It roughly correlates with the MDD.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 355.86
*   **Previous Close:** 355.81
*   **Change:** 0.01
*   **5-day SMA:** 353.074
*   **20-day SMA:** 338.4747
*   **60-day SMA:** 339.1831

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly higher than the previous close. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term upward trend. The 20-day and 60-day SMAs are relatively close, indicating some stability in the medium-term trend, but recent prices are trending above these averages.

**3) Analysis of RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 73.22 (Overbought - indicates the stock may be due for a pullback)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.6785 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (6 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01). This indicates a strong buy signal based on the algorithm.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** 598.5% (High - a potentially optimistic forecast for long-term investment)

**Analysis:**  The RSI suggests the stock is overbought and could experience a correction. However, the PPO indicates positive momentum. The MRI and the hybrid signal suggest a medium to strong investment recommendation, but this contrasts with the high RSI. The extremely high expected return should be viewed with skepticism.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Performance Lag:** ADBE has underperformed the S&P 500 in the recent period, and its relative performance is at the bottom of its historical range.
*   **Historical Volatility:** The stock has historically exhibited high volatility, as indicated by the large maximum drawdowns.
*   **Mixed Signals:** While short-term moving averages suggest an upward trend, the RSI indicates an overbought condition.
*   **AI Opportunity & Risk:** Adobe is aggressively pursuing AI opportunities, but potential lawsuits pose a risk.
*   **Analyst Disagreement:** Analysts have a "Buy" consensus, but with a wide range of target prices, showing uncertainty.
*   **Solid Financials:** Revenue and profit margins are strong. However, equity has decreased.
*   **Expected Return Caution:** The extremely high expected return should be viewed critically.
*   **Key Consideration:** Adobe is transitioning. The current market conditions call for a new direction, but the market is not sure if AI is the answer.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data presents a mixed picture. ADBE shows strong financials and is actively pursuing growth in AI, but it has underperformed the market, faces legal risks, and shows signs of being overbought. The high volatility also makes it a risky investment.

Therefore, an investment in ADBE would be rated as a **Medium Risk, Medium Reward** opportunity. Investors should weigh the potential for AI-driven growth against the current valuation, volatility, and potential legal challenges. A more conservative approach would involve waiting for a pullback or more clarity on the lawsuit situation before investing.
