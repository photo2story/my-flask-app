Over the reviewed period, ADBE significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), exhibiting a 23.19% higher cumulative return.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods.  Alpha, representing excess returns compared to the market, is mostly positive (except for 2015-2017 and 2016-2018), suggesting periods of outperformance relative to the market.  Beta, measuring volatility relative to the market, is consistently high (above 70), indicating that ADBE's price is highly sensitive to market fluctuations.  The significant increase in market capitalization over the years reflects growth and success.

* **Closing Price:** $349.07
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $373.77
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $394.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $424.84

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The significant negative change from the previous close (-$4.95) indicates a recent sharp decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 22.57 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.74 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +6.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** 268.6%

The technical indicators suggest a bearish sentiment. The overbought RSI combined with negative PPO indicates a potential for further price declines. However, the recent upward movement in relative divergence and a high expected return (in the long run) indicate a positive long-term outlook. The recent significant price drop likely contributed to the overbought RSI.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue, however, with a noticeable dip in Q1 2024. The repetition of the 2024-03-27 data point in the table needs clarification. A further analysis needs more consistent data for meaningful interpretation.


| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출      |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2025-03-26 | 4.15 | $5.71B    |
| 2024-09-25 | 3.78 | $5.41B    |
| 2024-06-26 | 3.5  | $5.31B    |
| 2024-03-27 | 1.37 | $5.18B    |
| 2025-03-26 | 1.37 | $5.18B    |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals consistently high profit margins and substantial equity. However, the Return on Equity (ROE) shows a declining trend from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025, though it remains positive. The significantly lower ROE in Q1 2024 requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.  The consistent high profit margins indicate a strong business model.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-02-28 | $5.71B | 89.11% |
| 2024-11-30 | $5.61B | 89.01% |
| 2024-08-31 | $5.41B | 89.76% |
| 2024-05-31 | $5.31B | 88.74% |
| 2024-02-29 | $5.18B | 88.61% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |

| 2025-02-28 | $13.10B | 13.83% |
| 2024-11-30 | $14.11B | 11.93% |
| 2024-08-31 | $14.54B | 11.58% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a strong long-term growth potential. However, recent price action indicates a bearish trend, reflected in its current price being below its moving averages and the negative PPO and overbought RSI. The significant price drop warrants careful consideration.  While the high expected return and historical outperformance are positive signs, the current market risk, negative recent price action and drop in ROE in Q1 2024 raise concerns.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the Q1 2024 drop in EPS and ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment strategy might be suitable given the company's long-term growth potential, but short-term volatility should be considered.  The provided data has some inconsistencies (e.g., repeated data points) requiring clarification before drawing definitive conclusions.
