## ADBE (Adobe Inc) Stock Analysis

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

ADBE has outperformed the S&P 500 with a cumulative return of 126.3% compared to the S&P 500's 120.8%, resulting in a 5.4% difference. The relative outperformance stands at 3.5, indicating that ADBE's current performance is in the higher percentiles compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  Adobe Inc. is a multinational computer software company known for its creative software suite.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows high alpha and low beta in the periods between 2015-2021, indicating significant outperformance with relatively low market correlation. However, the recent periods (2020-2024) show substantial negative returns, negative alpha, and low beta. This suggests underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and continued low market correlation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

ADBE's closing price is 455.23, slightly higher than the last market price of 452.73.  The stock is currently trading below its 5-day (481.40), 20-day (512.57), and 60-day (504.52) moving averages, indicating a downtrend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 27.31 - Suggests the stock is currently oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity.
* PPO: -1.84 - A negative PPO indicates that the short-term average is below the long-term average, reinforcing the downtrend observation.
* Recent Relative Strength Change: -19.3 - A negative change confirms weakening performance against the S&P 500.
* Expected Return: 2307.1% - This exceptionally high expected return (relative to the S&P 500) needs careful consideration, especially given the recent negative performance trends.  It appears overly optimistic and potentially unreliable.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* Latest quarterly results (September 25, 2024) show EPS of $3.78 and revenue of $5.41B.
* Revenue has shown consistent growth over the past five quarters, albeit at a slowing pace.
* EPS fluctuates, with a significant increase in the latest quarter. However, the duplicated entry for 2023-09-27 and 2024-09-25 raises concerns about data accuracy. No information is available to assess beats or misses against expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* Revenue shows consistent growth over the past five quarters.
* Profit margins remain consistently high, hovering around 88-89%.
* ROE fluctuates, with the latest quarter showing a rebound to 11.58% after a significant dip in Q1 2024.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

The analysis lacks context regarding recent news and analyst opinions. Information on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst sentiment is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.

**7. Summary and Overall Analysis:**

ADBE demonstrates a mixed picture.  While historical performance (pre-2020) was strong, recent periods show a significant downturn.  Short-term indicators like price action, RSI, and PPO suggest the stock might be oversold, but the negative relative strength change and declining moving averages point to continued weakness. While revenue and profit margins remain strong, the fluctuating ROE and extremely optimistic expected return warrant caution. The lack of news and analyst sentiment further limits the analysis.  Additional investigation is needed before making investment decisions.


**8. Recommendation:**

Further research is required to reconcile the conflicting signals and assess the validity of the exceptionally high expected return.  Investors should carefully consider the recent underperformance and look for confirmation of a trend reversal before taking any action.  Gathering more information on news, analyst sentiment, and the potential data discrepancies in the earnings data is essential for a more complete and reliable analysis.
