**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

ADBE has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return 11.83% higher.  The relative outperformance of 9.3% suggests that ADBE's performance is in the top 9.3% percentile compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.  However, this is based on past performance and not a guarantee of future returns.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance. While some periods show high CAGR and strong alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others demonstrate significant negative returns and high maximum drawdown (MDD).  The recent years (2022-2025) show high beta (market sensitivity) and fluctuating alpha, suggesting increased volatility and market dependence.  Note that market capitalization (Cap(B)) has fluctuated considerably, indicating market sentiment changes surrounding the stock.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, but with considerable volatility in recent years.  While the recent price shows some upward movement and revenue growth is consistent, the inconsistent earnings per share, fluctuating ROE, and high beta suggest caution. The high long-term expected return requires further substantiation.  A thorough analysis of the Q2 2024 ROE drop and future earnings projections is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data provided offers a glimpse into ADBE's performance, but comprehensive due diligence is necessary.
