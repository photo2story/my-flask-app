## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Adobe Inc. is a multinational computer software company.  The provided data shows Adobe's cumulative return at 104.26% compared to the S&P 500's 112.74%.  Therefore, Adobe underperformed the S&P 500 by **8.48 percentage points** as of the last day in the dataset.  The relative divergence indicates Adobe's performance is in the lower percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and other metrics fluctuate significantly across different periods.  While several periods show high CAGR, exceeding that of the S&P 500 implicitly (given the overall underperformance),  the recent periods (2022-2025) show substantial negative returns.  The consistently low alpha (around 0.1) suggests that Adobe's returns have not significantly outperformed the market risk, adjusted for beta.  The fluctuating Beta indicates varying levels of market sensitivity over the years.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Adobe's recent performance has been lackluster compared to the S&P 500. While the company exhibits strong revenue and profit margins, the inconsistent EPS growth and recent negative returns raise concerns.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, but the downward price trend needs careful consideration. The unusually high expected return needs verification.  Further investigation into the underlying factors driving recent performance is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A more thorough analysis would require examining market conditions, competitor performance, and Adobe's future growth prospects.  The provided data alone doesn't provide a definitive buy/sell recommendation.
