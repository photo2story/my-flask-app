## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Stock Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Adobe Inc. is a multinational computer software company.  The cumulative return of ADBE is 182.33%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 123.86%.  The difference is 58.47%, placing it at the 21.44th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -1.67% and a maximum of 278.89%).  This indicates strong outperformance, though the relative percentile suggests that even greater outperformance has been observed in the past.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows consistently high returns for ADBE over several years, exceeding that of the S&P 500 implied by its beta consistently above 1 (indicating higher volatility than the market). However, the most recent period (2022-2024) shows a negative return, highlighting the risk associated with this higher volatility.  The Alpha values consistently above 1 suggest that ADBE has generated returns above what would be expected based solely on its market exposure (Beta).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $503.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $519.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $496.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $519.29

The current price is below both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend, although the 20-day MA indicates support near the current price.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 59.23 –  Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, although nearing overbought territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.95 – A positive value indicates upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.37 – Shows a short-term upward trend in relative performance against the benchmark.

Given the price of $503.36 is relatively close to the 20-day moving average, neither significant upward nor downward pressure is definitively signaled.  Further observation is required. The expected return of 5.28% represents a potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided quarterly earnings data shows consistent revenue growth, although EPS is fluctuating.  A detailed analysis requires access to analyst estimates for comparison to evaluate the significance of the EPS fluctuations.  The most recent quarter's earnings (2024-09-25) show a significant increase compared to the previous quarters of 2024, indicating a potential positive trend.  Missing data for expected EPS makes a full analysis challenging.

**6. Financial Information:**

The revenue and profitability data indicate strong and consistent revenue growth with a high profit margin that slightly decreased over the year but remains very healthy.  ROE (Return on Equity) has fluctuated over the reported period, implying a varying efficiency in using equity to generate profits.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying reasons for this variation.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests potential short-term weakness, though it remains near its 20-day moving average providing support. Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly positive outlook.  Strong financial performance, with consistent revenue growth and high profit margins, supports the company's fundamental strength. The expected long-term outperformance should be considered in light of the inherent volatility reflected in the historical Beta.  A deeper dive into recent news, analyst reports, and a comparison of actual vs. expected earnings will offer a more precise evaluation.
