**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.4 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 3816.3% (This extremely high figure needs careful scrutiny.  It's likely a projection based on specific assumptions that are not provided and should be viewed with significant skepticism.  The context and methodology for this calculation are crucial to its validity.)  The current price is considerably below recent highs, potentially reflecting this negative divergence.  A sharp rebound is possible given the oversold RSI, but further downside is also a possibility given the bearish PPO.

The provided data reveals:

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue has generally increased quarter-over-quarter, although there's a slight dip from Q2 2024 to Q1 2024.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS shows significant variability.  There's a notable drop from Q2 2024 ($3.50) to Q1 2024 ($1.37), followed by an increase again in Q3 2024 ($3.78).  The repetition of the September 25th data point is likely an error.
* **Comparison:**  Without expected values, it's impossible to definitively state whether the results beat or missed expectations.  The data solely shows actual reported figures.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which are not provided in the given data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, but recent performance indicates a downturn.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition (RSI), but bearish momentum (PPO) and price action below moving averages point to continued potential downside.  The exceptionally high projected return needs further clarification on its methodology.  The company demonstrates strong revenue and profit margins, although recent EPS and ROE figures display significant volatility.  Further investigation into the reasons for the Q1 2024 dip in EPS and ROE and a review of recent news and analyst opinions are needed to provide a more comprehensive assessment.  The absence of this crucial context significantly limits the conclusiveness of this analysis.
