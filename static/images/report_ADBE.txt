## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

ADBE, Adobe Inc., is a multinational computer software company.  The provided data shows ADBE significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **ADBE Cumulative Return:** 125.37%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 76.18%
* **Return Difference:** 49.2%  This indicates ADBE outperformed VOO significantly.  The relative divergence of 27.3% places ADBE's performance in the upper quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows mixed results.  While several periods show strong alpha (outperformance relative to the market), the most recent period shows negative CAGR and a very high MDD (Maximum Drawdown).  This suggests considerable volatility and risk associated with the stock. Beta values generally stay above 1, indicating a higher sensitivity to market fluctuations than the S&P 500. The market capitalization of ADBE has been increasing steadily over the years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $348.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $349.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $368.80
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $413.96

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent price increase of $1.34 from the previous close might indicate a temporary bounce, but further observation is needed.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 32.49 (Oversold, suggesting potential upward movement)
* **PPO:** -0.0468 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +0.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 227.9% (This is a high expected return; it's crucial to understand the assumptions and limitations of this prediction before considering it a reliable metric).  This suggests significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) based on this estimate. However, this should be viewed with caution given market volatility and the unpredictable nature of long-term returns.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has historically outperformed the S&P 500, displaying periods of strong growth and high alpha.  However, recent data shows a decline in price, coupled with negative PPO and a relatively low RSI, indicating potential further downside risk in the short term. The high expected return is encouraging for long-term investors, but the considerable volatility and recent negative CAGR in the alpha/beta analysis highlights significant risk.  Thorough due diligence, including examination of the reasons behind the Q1 2024 ROE drop and the duplicated 2025 data, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current oversold condition (RSI) and recent price bounce could signal a buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance, but careful monitoring is advised.
