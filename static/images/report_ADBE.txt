Adobe has demonstrated strong long-term growth but also significant short-term volatility.  The high expected return projection requires further investigation and should be treated with caution.  The current technical indicators suggest a potential short-term pullback despite positive momentum.  Consistent high profit margins and revenue growth are positive indicators.  However, further analysis of the causes of fluctuations in ROE and the inconsistent earnings data is necessary.  A more comprehensive analysis should consider macroeconomic factors and competitive landscape to provide a more robust assessment.
