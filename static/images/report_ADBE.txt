## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

ADBE's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO), showcasing strong performance.  Recent price movements indicate a slightly overbought condition, but the long-term outlook remains positive based on strong earnings growth and a high expected return relative to the S&P 500.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Adobe Inc. is a multinational computer software company.  ADBE's cumulative return of 128.67% considerably exceeds the S&P 500's 122.48% cumulative return. The difference is 6.2%, placing it in the 7.1 percentile of its historical relative performance range (max: 236.2%, min: -11.3%).

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals consistently positive alpha values over the past several years, indicating ADBE has outperformed the market, except for the 2020-2022 period.  The consistently low beta values (near 0) suggest low correlation with the overall market, a trait generally associated with more stable, less volatile stocks. However, the sharp negative CAGR in 2020-2022 highlights vulnerability to broader market downturns.  The recent positive CAGR might suggest a recovery from such downturn.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue        |
|------------|-------|-----------------|
| 2024-09-25 | 3.78  | 5.41 B$         |
| 2024-06-26 | 3.50  | 5.31 B$         |
| 2024-03-27 | 1.37  | 5.18 B$         |
| 2023-09-27 | 3.07  | 4.89 B$         |
| 2024-09-25 | 3.07  | 4.89 B$         |

There's a possible data entry error with two entries for 2024-09-25.  Assuming the first entry is correct,  revenue and EPS show a generally upward trend, with strong growth in the latest quarter (Q3 2024).  However, a more detailed analysis requires consistent data.


**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data is available, hindering a complete financial analysis.  This critical information gap prevents a thorough assessment of profitability and financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE exhibits strong long-term growth potential, demonstrated by its consistent outperformance of the S&P 500 and positive alpha.  While the recent price suggests a slight overbought condition (RSI nearing 70), the robust earnings growth and high projected excess return justify the optimistic outlook, especially for long-term investors (2+ years).  However, the lack of comprehensive financial data and the vulnerability to market downturns (as seen in 2020-2022) warrant careful consideration. Further investigation into the missing financial data is crucial for a more complete and accurate assessment.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in Q4 2024) also need to be addressed.
