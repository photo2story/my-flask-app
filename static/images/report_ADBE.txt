*   **20-day SMA:** 348.33
*   **60-day SMA:** 339.42

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA, but above both the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a potential short-term downtrend, but an overall uptrend over the past two to three months. The fact that the price is fluctuating near 352/353 indicates that investors are showing very little reaction to recent news.

*   **RSI:** 60.12
*   **PPO:** -0.0015

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.3 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 617.4%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI suggests that, based on the model, the current market conditions offer a reasonable level of safety for investment in ADBE.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 60.12 is nearing overbought territory (typically above 70) but not quite there. It suggests upward momentum, but also indicates that the stock may be nearing a potential pullback.
*   **PPO:** A PPO very close to zero suggests that the short-term and long-term moving averages are nearly identical, implying that there is no significant change in trend happening in either direction.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** A 100% buy signal indicates a strong recommendation to allocate all available cash to ADBE shares, suggesting it is considered a safe investment (given a high MRI).
*   **Divergence Change:** The short-term decline in relative divergence confirms the underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** A very high expected return suggests that the model projects considerable growth for ADBE over the long term.
*   **{price': 352.51, 'previousClose': 353.16, 'change': -0.18}:** This relatively small price change from the previous close suggests that the stock's value remains stable and doesn't indicate a sharp rebound or decline, despite the various news and analyst opinions available.
