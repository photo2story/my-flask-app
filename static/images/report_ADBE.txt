The difference is 59.2%, placing it at the 21.7th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a maximum difference of 278.9% and a minimum of -1.7%).

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $504.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $511.56

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting minor short-term downward pressure.  It's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a generally upward trend.  The close proximity to the moving averages points to a period of consolidation.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.36 – Positive value suggests a bullish trend.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +2.6 –  Short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 486.9% -  Represents a significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, if the historical trend holds.  This is a substantial projection and should be considered with caution, as past performance is not indicative of future results.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent revenue growth across the reported quarters.  EPS experienced a significant drop in Q1 2024 ($1.37) before rebounding to higher levels in subsequent quarters. There is an apparent duplicate entry for September 25th, 2024.  We only consider the first entry. No information is available regarding earnings expectations to evaluate whether the results were "beats" or "misses."  The data simply showcases quarterly financial performance, with no further context.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows consistent growth, and profit margins are high and relatively stable, ranging from 87.44% to 89.76%.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity fluctuates, and ROE (Return on Equity) shows some variability. The significant drop in ROE in Q2 2024 requires further investigation.  Overall, profitability metrics appear strong.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information.  The report lacks details on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the given historical period.  While recent price action suggests a minor short-term pullback, the longer-term trends are positive, supported by consistently increasing revenue, generally high profit margins, and a strong historical alpha. However, the recent drop in ROE and the high MDD observed in some periods caution against overconfidence.  The projected long-term return is very optimistic and relies heavily on past performance continuing.  To gain a complete picture, a more in-depth analysis considering current market conditions, industry trends, and the company's future prospects is essential.  Further information regarding analyst opinions and recent news is needed for a more comprehensive evaluation.  The missing Q1 2024 data warrants further investigation.
