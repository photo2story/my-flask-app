**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue     |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| 2025-03-26 | $4.15  | $5.71B      |

| 2025-03-26 | $1.37  | $5.18B      | *(Duplicate entry - potential error in data)*

Revenue shows a generally upward trend, though there's a notable jump in the most recent quarter (2025-03-26), and an apparent duplication in the data which requires correction. EPS is also showing an upward trend but inconsistent.  Further investigation into the data is needed.


**5. Financial Information:**

Equity shows a recent decline, which could be linked to the recent negative price action. ROE is also somewhat inconsistent, requiring further analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

ADBE has historically shown strong performance relative to the S&P 500. However, recent data paints a more bearish picture.  The stock price is significantly below its moving averages, technical indicators are mostly negative (RSI, PPO, MRI), and the recent price drop is substantial.  While the company shows strong revenue growth and high profit margins, the recent earnings data needs clarification (duplicate entry).  The projected long-term return of 268.6% should be treated with caution given the current market conditions and the conflicting signals from the financial and technical data.  Further investigation is needed into the inconsistent data points and the reasons behind the recent negative trend before making any investment decisions.  A thorough review of the data sources and any relevant news is recommended.
