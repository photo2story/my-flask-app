## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Adobe Inc. is a leading provider of creative software, digital marketing solutions, and document management applications.

The cumulative return of ADBE is 112.80%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 118.37%.  Therefore, ADBE underperformed VOO by **-5.57%** as of the last data point.  The relative divergence of -5.6% places ADBE in the 2.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. This suggests that while underperforming recently, it hasn't significantly deviated from its historical trend relative to the market.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows highly variable performance over different timeframes. While exhibiting periods of significant outperformance (CAGR exceeding 100% in several periods), ADBE also experienced substantial drawdowns, notably a -63% and a -122% CAGR during certain periods.  The consistently high Beta (around 187.0, which seems anomalously high and should be double-checked for accuracy) indicates high sensitivity to market movements. The Alpha, consistently around 0.1, suggests marginal outperformance relative to the market, though this is subject to the limitations of using Beta as a market benchmark given the extremely high beta value.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 77.0% | 17.1% | 50.0% | 187.0 |
| 2016-2018  | 82.0% | 24.1% | 67.0% | 187.0 |
| 2017-2019  | 136.0% | 24.1% | 104.0% | 187.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 165.0% | 25.2% | 131.0% | 187.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 155.0% | 25.2% | 75.0% | 187.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -63.0% | 58.3% | -71.0% | 187.0 |
| 2021-2023  | -12.0% | 58.3% | -36.0% | 187.0 |
| 2022-2024  | -122.0% | 49.5% | -144.0% | 187.0 |

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $429.99
* **5-day Moving Average:** $419.08
* **20-day Moving Average:** $432.70
* **60-day Moving Average:** $480.47

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 20-day MA suggests some near-term support.  However, the significant distance from the 60-day MA indicates a more considerable pullback.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 35.5 – Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity, but this should be considered in the context of other indicators and overall market sentiment.

* **PPO:** 0.317 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum, but the low value suggests this momentum is weak.

* **Relative Divergence:** +2.3 – Indicates a recent short-term upward movement relative to the S&P 500.

* **Price Change:** A 0.72% increase from the previous close suggests a minor upward trend; however, it is not a significant surge.  It does not require attention to rapid shifts.

* **Expected Return:** 3596.6% – This extraordinarily high figure for expected return over the long term (2+ years) needs further clarification regarding its calculation methodology.  It's crucial to understand the assumptions behind this estimate, as it's unusually high and may not be realistic.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-09-25 | 3.78 | $5.41 Billion |
| 2024-06-26 | 3.5  | $5.31 Billion |
| 2024-03-27 | 1.37 | $5.18 Billion |
| 2023-09-27 | 3.07 | $4.89 Billion |
| 2024-09-25 | 3.07 | $4.89 Billion | *(Duplicate Entry)*

Earnings show some volatility, with a significant jump in EPS in Q3 2024.  Revenue growth appears consistent, but further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this growth and the drivers behind the EPS fluctuations. The duplicate entry for September 25, 2024 should be clarified.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-11-30 | $5.61 Billion | 89.01%       |
| 2024-08-31 | $5.41 Billion | 89.76%       |
| 2024-05-31 | $5.31 Billion | 88.74%       |
| 2024-02-29 | $5.18 Billion | 88.61%       |
| 2023-11-30 | $5.05 Billion | 87.44%       |

Revenue shows steady growth, and profit margins remain consistently high, indicating strong financial health.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity (B) | ROE          |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-11-30 | $14.11     | 11.93%       |
| 2024-08-31 | $14.54     | 11.58%       |
| 2024-05-31 | $14.84     | 10.60%       |
| 2024-02-29 | $15.46     | 4.01%        |
| 2023-11-30 | $16.52     | 8.98%        |

Equity shows some fluctuation, and ROE is also volatile, particularly the significant drop in Q1 2024.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for this variation.


**7. Overall Conclusion:**

ADBE exhibits strong revenue growth and high profit margins, suggesting a fundamentally sound company. However, its performance relative to the S&P 500 has been mixed, with periods of significant outperformance and underperformance. The high beta indicates substantial market sensitivity. The unusually high projected return needs critical evaluation. The oversold RSI and the recent upward movement relative to the S&P 500 could present a potential buying opportunity for long-term investors with a high risk tolerance, but careful consideration of the considerable volatility is essential.  Further research is needed to address inconsistencies in the data (e.g., the anomalously high beta, the duplicate earnings data point, and the exceptionally high projected return).  The information provided should be complemented by broader market analysis and independent verification of data points.
