*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 0.4 (+) Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0%

    *   The high MRI suggests that, despite recent performance, the model considers this a good time to invest. This may be based on factors not immediately apparent in the other metrics.
    *   The RSI of 58.21 is in neutral territory, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
    *   The slightly negative PPO (-0.0894) suggests a slight downtrend but is very close to zero.
    *   The hybrid signal is recommending fully investing cash.
    *   The recent increase in the relative divergence is a short-term positive.
    *   The 0.0% expected return compared to the S&P 500 is concerning, as it implies that the model does not expect ADBE to outperform the market going forward.
    *   The price change from the last market day reflects a slight downward fluctuation. This should be taken into account with the other factors.
