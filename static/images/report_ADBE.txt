## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Adobe Inc. (ADBE) is a multinational computer software company that develops and sells software products and services for creative professionals, businesses, and individuals.

ADBE's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 115.46% - 52.12% = **63.34%**.  The provided relative outperformance (63.3) places ADBE's performance within the 3.2 percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500, indicating above-average performance but not necessarily an outlier. The provided CAGR values show significant volatility. While some periods show positive returns, others show substantial negative ones. This highlights the risk involved in investing in ADBE.  The high Beta values (around 1.0 consistently) suggest a high correlation with the overall market and thus higher volatility compared to the S&P 500.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures further reinforce the risk profile of ADBE.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $435.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $435.27
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $431.38
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $477.17

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20 and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price change of -$0.43 indicates a minor negative movement, not significant enough to classify as a sharp drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.96  (Slightly below 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions, but leaning towards bearish.)
* **PPO:** 0.99 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but the value is relatively low.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.0 (-) (Short-term downward trend)

The expected return of 4112.3% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is exceptionally high and needs further justification or clarification. This number seems unrealistic without additional detail on the calculation methodology.  It's crucial to understand the assumptions behind this extraordinary figure.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-09-25).  Ignoring the duplicate, the data shows generally increasing revenue and EPS, although there's volatility quarter-to-quarter.  A detailed analysis would require a deeper look at the underlying drivers of these numbers and comparison to analyst expectations.  The quarterly EPS growth isn't consistently strong, hinting at some potential near-term uncertainties in earnings.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-09-25 | 3.78   | $5.41 B       |
| 2024-06-26 | 3.5    | $5.31 B       |
| 2024-03-27 | 1.37   | $5.18 B       |
| 2023-09-27 | 3.07   | $4.89 B       |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue growth is consistent, showing a positive trend. Profit margins are consistently high, exceeding 87%. However, Equity and ROE show some fluctuation, needing further investigation to understand the underlying causes.  A declining equity from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024 warrants further analysis.  The significant drop in ROE in Q1 2024 is concerning and requires further scrutiny.

| Quarter     | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity    | ROE     |
|-------------|---------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| 2024-11-30 | $5.61B  | 89.01%        | $14.11B  | 11.93%  |
| 2024-08-31 | $5.41B  | 89.76%        | $14.54B  | 11.58%  |
| 2024-05-31 | $5.31B  | 88.74%        | $14.84B  | 10.60%  |
| 2024-02-29 | $5.18B  | 88.61%        | $15.46B  | 4.01%   |
| 2023-11-30 | $5.05B  | 87.44%        | $16.52B  | 8.98%   |


**7. Overall Summary:**

ADBE has shown strong cumulative returns significantly outperforming the S&P 500, but this performance has been volatile.  While revenue and profit margins remain strong, recent price action and some inconsistencies in earnings and equity metrics raise concerns.  The exceptionally high projected long-term return requires further investigation and validation.  Investors should carefully consider the risk profile, which is indicated by the high beta and significant maximum drawdown figures.  Further due diligence, including analysis of competitor landscape, industry trends, and detailed financial statement review is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The provided high expected return needs critical evaluation.  The significant drop in ROE needs explanation.
