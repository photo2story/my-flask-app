**Analysis of Provided Alpha/Beta Data:**

The provided Alpha and Beta data shows varying levels of outperformance (Alpha) and systematic risk (Beta) relative to the S&P 500 over different periods.  While Alpha is consistently positive, indicating outperformance, it fluctuates, highlighting the volatility inherent in equity investments.

The significant drop in performance and negative alpha in 2022-2024 is notable and requires further investigation into market conditions and company-specific factors.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $503.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $499.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $514.28

The price is currently slightly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend, while above its 20 and 5-day moving averages indicating recent support.
