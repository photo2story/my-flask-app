## Adobe Inc. (ADBE) Stock Performance Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Adobe Inc. (ADBE), a leading provider of creative software, shows a slightly lower cumulative return than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  While recent quarterly earnings demonstrate strong revenue growth and high profit margins, recent price action suggests a potential near-term slowdown. Long-term prospects, however, remain positive given the strong historical CAGR and expected future returns exceeding the S&P 500.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **ADBE Cumulative Return:** 116.08%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 116.17%
* **Return Difference:** -0.09% (ADBE underperformed VOO by 0.09%)
* **Relative Divergence:** -0.1 (4.5% percentile based on historical range)

This indicates ADBE's performance is very slightly below the S&P 500, falling within the lower end of its historical relative performance range.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high CAGR values for several periods, indicating strong historical growth. However, the significant negative CAGR in 2020-2022 and 2022-2024 highlights vulnerability to market downturns.  Beta values fluctuate, suggesting sensitivity to market movements, with higher values observed in more recent years indicating increased market correlation.

Further investigation into the unusual Q2 2024 ROE and the duplicated earnings data point is recommended.  The relatively low current relative divergence compared to the broader market warrants monitoring of potential underperformance and sector-specific factors.
