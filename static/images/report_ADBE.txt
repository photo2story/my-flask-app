2026-01-01 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Adobe Inc. (ADBE) based on the provided data, broken down as requested.

**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Adobe Inc. is a multinational computer software company focused on creativity and document management software.
*   **Return Comparison:**
    *   ADBE Cumulative Return: 66.09%
    *   VOO Cumulative Return: 102.21%
    *   Divergence: -36.1 (Relative Divergence: 6.7)

*   **Analysis:** Adobe has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period, with a cumulative return difference of -36.1%. The relative divergence of 6.7 indicates that this performance difference is near the lower end of its historical range.  This suggests the underperformance is not an unusual occurrence, but the *magnitude* is considerable.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    | Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
    |------------|--------|-------|--------|------|--------|
    | 2024-2026  | 71.0%  | 82.6% | -35.0% | -0.0 | 148.7 |

    *   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 71% suggests very high potential growth.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 82.6% is a *very* large drawdown, indicating high volatility and risk. This is a critical point.
    *   **Alpha:** -35.0% indicates significant *underperformance* relative to its benchmark (likely the S&P 500), even adjusted for risk. This reinforces the return comparison above.
    *   **Beta:** -0.0 indicates very low correlation with the overall market. Adobe's performance is relatively independent of broader market movements.
    *   **Cap(B):** 148.7 B is the company's market capitalization (in billions).

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Price Data:**
    *   Current Close: 352.51
    *   Last Market Data: Price 350.45, Previous Close: 352.44, Change: -0.56
    *   5-day SMA: 352.97
    *   20-day SMA: 348.33
    *   60-day SMA: 339.42

*   **Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day SMA, above the 20-day SMA, and well above the 60-day SMA.  This suggests a recent period of upward price momentum, but with a minor pullback in the very short term.  The 20-day SMA being higher than the 60-day SMA further supports this recent upward trend. Last market's small change of -0.56 indicates low price fluctuations.

**3) RSI, PPO, Delta & Expected Return**

*   **Indicators:**
    *   MRI (Market Risk Indicator): 0.9 (Medium Investment) - Indicating low risk and suitable for investing
    *   RSI (Relative Strength Index): 60.12 - Near Overbought
    *   PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator): -0.0015
    *   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (6 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
    *   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -1.3 (Short-term decline)
    *   Expected Return: 593.9% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests that based on this risk assessment, Adobe is a suitable candidate for investment.
    *   The RSI of 60.12 is getting close to overbought territory (above 70). This *could* indicate a potential pullback in the near term, or it could simply mean continued upward momentum.
    *   The PPO is near zero, suggesting limited momentum, but recent decline, which aligns with the "Recent divergence change."
    *   The hybrid signal is strongly indicative of the stock being a buy as well as being a safe and low-risk investment.
    *   The *very* high expected return (593.9%) is significant and should be carefully scrutinized. It is possible that this is an error, or the algorithm has a high optimism.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

*   **Earnings Data:**

    | 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
    |------------|------|------------|
    | 2025-09-24 | 4.18 | 5.99 B$    |
    | 2025-06-25 | 3.95 | 5.87 B$    |
    | 2025-03-26 | 4.15 | 5.71 B$    |
    | 2024-09-25 | 3.78 | 5.41 B$    |
    | 2025-09-24 | 3.78 | 5.41 B$    |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   Both EPS (Earnings Per Share) and revenue are generally increasing over the last year. This indicates healthy growth.
    *   The increase in revenue has been steady, showing consistent performance.
    *   The most recent EPS data shows significant revenue growth compared to the previous similar quarter (2024-09-24).
    *   The fact that the 2025-09-24 data is repeated is strange. Possible data error.

**6) Financial Information**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**

    | Quarter    | Revenue | Profit Margin |
    |------------|---------|---------------|
    | 2025-08-31 | $5.99B  | 89.28%        |
    | 2025-05-31 | $5.87B  | 89.14%        |
    | 2025-02-28 | $5.71B  | 89.11%        |
    | 2024-11-30 | $5.61B  | 89.01%        |

*   **Capital and Profitability:**

    | Quarter    | Equity   | ROE    |
    |------------|----------|--------|
    | 2025-08-31 | $11.77B  | 15.06% |
    | 2025-05-31 | $11.45B  | 14.77% |
    | 2025-02-28 | $13.10B  | 13.83% |
    | 2024-11-30 | $14.11B  | 11.93% |

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Revenue:** Consistent growth in revenue from quarter to quarter.
    *   **Profit Margin:** Extremely high and stable profit margins (around 89%). This suggests Adobe has strong pricing power and efficient operations.
    *   **Equity:** Equity has decreased in the last 4 quarters. A decreasing equity can be a concern, as it can indicate the company is using its assets, or having trouble growing its assets.
    *   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is increasing over the past year, despite equity decreasing. This suggests Adobe is improving its profitability on the equity they do have.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Summary:**

    *   **Underperformance vs. Market:** Adobe has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period measured, but recent price action shows signs of recovery.
    *   **High Growth Potential, High Risk:** The high CAGR and analyst target prices indicate strong growth potential, but the high MDD reveals significant volatility and risk.
    *   **Positive Analyst Sentiment:** Analyst consensus is a "Buy" with a significant upside implied in the average target price.
    *   **Strong Financials:** Adobe demonstrates solid revenue growth, *exceptionally* high profit margins, but declining equity.
    *   **AI Monetization:**  A key driver of future growth is expected to be Adobe's ability to monetize AI technologies.

*   **Investment Considerations:**

    *   **Risk Tolerance:** This investment is suitable for investors with a high-risk tolerance due to the observed volatility.
    *   **Growth Outlook:** The company's potential in AI and the positive analyst sentiment suggest long-term growth prospects.
    *   **Valuation:** Despite the positive outlook, carefully consider valuation and whether the current price accurately reflects future growth potential. The divergence from the S&P 500 needs to be understood.
    *   **Data Anomalies:** The repeated earnings data and the extremely high expected return should be verified.
    *  **Equity:** The equity trend should be monitored to determine whether it will begin to increase or continue to decline. A declining equity can reduce investor confidence.

*   **Recommendation:**

    The data presents a mixed picture. While Adobe has shown underperformance and high volatility, there are strong signs of future growth and profitability, supported by analyst ratings and financial performance. With the high expected return, if the growth is achieved and the equity stabilizes, the current Adobe stock is very attractive. It warrants further investigation and a careful assessment of risk tolerance before making an investment decision. The high growth, expected return, and MRI indicators are very attractive. Investors should monitor financial reports for changes in debt, equity, and profits.
