*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 101.92%
*   **Divergence:** -41.5 (ADBE is underperforming the S&P 500)
*   **Relative Divergence:** 2.0 (This indicates the divergence is near the *minimum* observed in the historical range. It suggests the underperformance relative to VOO is not as extreme as it has been in the past. Since the scale is -45.9 to 169.8, so 2.0 is close to -45.9).

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, CAGR, MDD Table:**

The provided table shows rolling 3-year periods. Here's what we can glean:

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Highly variable, ranging from -138% to 140%. The earlier periods (2015-2021) show strong growth, while recent periods (2020-2025) show significant negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high drawdowns (around 80%), indicating significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Fluctuates significantly, indicating periods of outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha) relative to the market. The recent periods show substantially negative Alpha.
*   **Beta:**  Generally low (ranging from -0.0 to 0.8), suggesting ADBE's price is less sensitive to overall market movements compared to VOO. The Beta has been trending upward, implying increasing market correlation over time.

**Analysis:**

The stock price is *below* all three moving averages. This *could* indicate a short-term downtrend.  The 5-day SMA is slightly below the current price, suggesting a very recent potential stabilization or slight upward movement.
