2025-12-25 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the data provided for Southern Co (SO):

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Southern Co (SO) is a leading energy company providing electricity and natural gas.
*   **SO Cumulative Return:** 57.01%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 100.88%
*   **Divergence:** -43.87%
    *   **Divergence Range:** -47.6 to 44.4
    *   **Relative Divergence:** 4.0  (Near the bottom of its historical divergence range)

*   **Analysis:** Southern Co has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. The negative divergence shows it has lagged the market benchmark. The low relative divergence suggests the current underperformance is near the worst it has been historically (relative to its own range).

**Alpha, Beta, and Related Metrics Analysis**

*   **CAGR:** Varies significantly year-to-year, ranging from -10% to 54%. Recent years show lower single-digit growth.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown, indicating substantial potential for loss if poorly timed.
*   **Alpha:** Fluctuates considerably, showing periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. Recent years are negative.
*   **Beta:** Generally hovers around 0, suggesting low correlation with the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization is generally increasing, indicating growth in the company's overall value.

**Analysis:**
The table indicates that Southern Co's performance is inconsistent. While some periods show strong growth (high CAGR and positive Alpha), others are negative. The high Maximum Drawdown is a significant risk factor. The low Beta suggests that Southern Co.'s stock price is not closely tied to the movements of the broader market, possibly due to its nature as a utility company.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 85.28
*   **Last Market Price:** 87.17, Previous Close: 86.39, Change: 0.9
*   **5-day SMA:** 86.25
*   **20-day SMA:** 87.23
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.97

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), which are below the 60-day SMA. This suggests a short-term downward trend.  The last market data indicates a recent positive price change, however, it's not enough to counteract the larger trend.

**3) RSI, PPO, Market Risk Indicator, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 32.91 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.1966

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 1.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term Rise)
*   **Expected Return:** 218.7% (Long-term)

*   **Analysis:** The RSI suggests the stock may be approaching oversold conditions, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. The PPO is not particularly informative on its own without context. The Hybrid Signal recommends a full buy, driven by a high MRI, which contrasts with the recent price action and underperformance. The significant "Expected Return" should be viewed cautiously, as it's a projection and may be based on optimistic assumptions.

*   **Target Price:** 96.72 (Avg), 109.00 (High), 76.00 (Low)

*   **Analysis:** Analyst sentiment is neutral, with a consensus "Hold" rating. The average target price suggests potential upside from the current price.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Southern Co. has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and demonstrates inconsistent financial performance based on historical data. The stock price shows a short-term downward trend, but its RSI indicates it may be approaching oversold territory. While the Hybrid Signal recommends a buy and the "Expected Return" is high, these should be considered cautiously, given the historical underperformance, analyst consensus ("Hold"), and recent negative news regarding a price decline.

**In Summary:**

Investing in Southern Co. presents a mixed picture. While the oversold RSI and high "Expected Return" might attract some investors, the stock's underperformance compared to the market, high MDD, neutral analyst sentiment, and lack of company-specific positive news suggests a cautious approach is warranted. The analyst target price does suggest upside potential, but consider the risks before investing. The unrelated news further emphasizes the lack of strong, positive catalysts for this particular stock right now.
