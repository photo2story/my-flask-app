This report analyzes Southern Company (SO), a major electric utility company providing power to the southeastern United States.  We will review its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, key financial indicators, and earnings data.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Southern Company's cumulative return is 84.00%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 112.74%.  This represents a difference of -28.7%.  The relative divergence of -28.7% places SO at the 27.3rd percentile of its historical range relative to VOO (max: +25.7%, min: -49.1%). This indicates SO has underperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered.  The alpha consistently shows near zero, suggesting the stock's returns are largely in line with the market (beta values vary but are generally below 1, indicating lower volatility compared to the market).

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently low or zero Alpha, indicating that SO's returns have not significantly outperformed the market benchmark over the past several years. Beta values fluctuate, generally indicating below market volatility.  The market cap shows significant growth over this period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $82.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $81.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $82.30
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $86.21

The current price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a more pronounced downward trend over the longer term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.99 – This indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory (below 50), but not yet significantly so.
* **PPO:** 0.17 – A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, but the value is relatively low.
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +9.9% – Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -21.5% – This suggests a potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.  This is a significant negative difference and warrants careful consideration.  This expected return is *relative* to the S&P 500; the actual return could still be positive, just less than the S&P 500 return.

The current price of $82.05 doesn't suggest extreme volatility (no evidence of sharp jumps or drops).

**7. Overall Summary:**

Southern Company (SO) shows consistent earnings exceeding expectations. While it demonstrates strong revenue and profitability, its performance has lagged the S&P 500 considerably over the analysed period. Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term upward trend, but the longer-term outlook, based on the significantly negative projected return relative to the S&P 500, is less optimistic. The low alpha indicates that SO's returns have historically tracked the overall market.  Investors should carefully weigh the relatively stable, dividend-paying nature of a utility stock against the potential for lower overall returns compared to the broader market.  The long-term projected underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is a key concern.
