**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock price ($85.58) is slightly below its 5-day moving average ($86.23) and slightly above its 20-day ($84.46) and 60-day ($84.41) moving averages, suggesting a minor upward trend but still within recent trading ranges.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 46.33 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral sentiment. The PPO of 0.34 is positive, suggesting a slight bullish momentum. The negative 20-day relative divergence change (-1.6%) points to a short-term downward trend.  The expected long-term return of -25.2% compared to the S&P 500 indicates a potential for significant underperformance over the next two years or more.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This lack of information significantly limits the ability to assess the overall financial health and growth prospects of the company.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Southern Company (SO) has shown a solid but ultimately underperforming return compared to the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While recent earnings have been positive and exceeding expectations, the long-term outlook shows a potential for continued underperformance relative to the broader market (-25.2% expected return). Technical indicators present a mixed signal, with a slightly positive PPO but a negative short-term relative divergence and a neutral RSI. The lack of key financial data limits a deeper financial assessment.  Investors should consider the company's consistent dividend payouts as a potential mitigating factor, as utilities often offer stability and income.  Further investigation into the fundamentals and competitive landscape of the utility sector is recommended before making any investment decisions.
