**7. Overall Analysis:**

Southern Company (SO) shows relatively stable financial performance, with consistent EPS beats. However, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the provided period.  Technical indicators suggest a slight positive momentum but are not strongly bullish.
