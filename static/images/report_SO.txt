*   **Negative Signals:** SO's cumulative return lags significantly behind the S&P 500. Alpha is negative. The news is mixed, with some positive developments but also broader economic concerns. The moving averages signal a short-term upward trend but a longer-term price decline.

**Conclusion:**

SO's recent performance has been weak compared to the overall market, as evidenced by the negative divergence.

While the recent news is mixed and analysts are neutral, the indicators such as RSI signals a potential buying opportunity in the short term. The expected return is very high, but this should be considered with caution given the other negative indicators.

**Recommendation:**

Given the neutral analyst consensus, mixed indicators, and the high expected return with underlying risks, a cautious approach is advisable. Before investing, it's recommended to conduct further research and consider your individual risk tolerance.
