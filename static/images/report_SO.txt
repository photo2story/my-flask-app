## Southern Company (SO) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Southern Company (SO) is a U.S. utility holding company providing electricity to millions of customers.  Over the observed period, SO's cumulative return (84.47%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's cumulative return (122.83%). The difference is -38.4%, placing it at the 14.3rd percentile of the historical range (-49.1% to 25.7%).  This indicates underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance over various periods. While some years show strong growth (e.g., 2017-2019, 2018-2020), others show weaker or even negative growth (e.g., 2016-2018).  Importantly, the alpha consistently remains at 0, suggesting the stock's returns are entirely explained by market movements and it doesn't offer any significant excess return relative to the market. The Beta of 90 is unusually high and likely reflects an error in the data.  A beta significantly above 1 suggests higher volatility than the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $82.26
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $83.46 (slightly above the current price, suggesting downward pressure)
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $82.56 (slightly above the current price, suggesting downward pressure)
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $85.29 (significantly above the current price, indicating a sustained downward trend)

The stock price has recently shown a downward trend, falling below all three moving averages.  The recent price change (-$0.32) is a minor decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (49.74):**  Near the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (0.32):** Positive, indicating a bullish momentum, although weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-8.6%):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance compared to the market.
* **Expected Return (-50.1%):**  The projected long-term (2+ years) underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is significant and concerning. This negative outlook needs careful consideration given the inherent limitations of future predictions.  The data strongly suggests avoiding SO in favor of a broader market index fund.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

SO has consistently exceeded its EPS expectations in recent quarters. This positive trend indicates strong earnings performance compared to market expectations.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable but profit margins have fluctuated, showing some decline at the end of 2023 before rebounding again.  Further investigation into the reasons for these fluctuations would be beneficial.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has grown steadily, suggesting financial stability. However, ROE has been inconsistent, showing periods of growth and decline. This volatility warrants further analysis into the underlying drivers.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SO's recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations. However, the stock's performance significantly lags the S&P 500. Technical indicators show a mixed signal, while the long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is projected to be substantially negative. The unusually high beta value requires further investigation to validate its accuracy.  Given the overall underperformance and the projected negative return, coupled with the significant lag behind the broader market, investment in SO currently appears to carry significant downside risk.  Further investigation is needed to determine if the negative outlook is justified, or if there is potentially market mispricing causing the lag in performance.  A broader market index fund might be a more attractive investment at this time.
