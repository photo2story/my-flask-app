**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Southern Company's cumulative return (113.90%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (72.42%) over the analyzed period.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals interesting trends:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 18.0% | 66.1% | -15.0% | 0.397 |
| 2016-2018  | 3.0% | 62.2% | -18.0% | 0.382 |
| 2017-2019  | 51.0% | 62.2% | 18.0% | 0.580 |
| 2018-2020  | 61.0% | 62.2% | 30.0% | 0.583 |
| 2019-2021  | 68.0% | 60.2% | 8.0% | 0.679 |
| 2020-2022  | 40.0% | 66.8% | 31.0% | 0.735 |
| 2021-2023  | 51.0% | 71.2% | 31.0% | 0.751 |

| 2023-2025  | 2.0% | 71.2% | -9.0% | 1.010 |

While the CAGR fluctuates,  the Beta consistently increases, indicating increasing market sensitivity over time. Alpha, representing excess return relative to the market, is generally positive in recent years, demonstrating periods of outperformance. However, recent years show declining Alpha, suggesting decreasing outperformance against the market.  The significant increase in Beta in recent years might indicate greater sensitivity to market fluctuations in the future.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $90.23
* **Previous Close:** $91.81
* **Change:** -$1.72 (A noticeable decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $90.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $89.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $88.14

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating a potentially longer-term bullish trend.  The recent -1.72 change warrants further investigation into potential news or events impacting the stock price.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 44.46 (Slightly below neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.07 (Positive, indicating a bullish momentum, though relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +4.5% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 18.1% (above the S&P 500, indicating potential outperformance in the long run, but again, this is not guaranteed.)

The recent price drop might be a buying opportunity for long-term investors, given the positive long-term expected return and relatively low RSI.  However, the moderately high market risk and increasing Beta suggest caution.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Southern Company (SO) exhibits strong long-term growth potential, with a history of outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, recent price action and increasing Beta suggest increased market sensitivity.  Positive earnings surprises and generally strong financial health are encouraging factors.  The medium-risk assessment warrants careful monitoring of the market and any relevant news impacting the utility sector. While the long-term outlook remains positive,  investors should consider the increased volatility indicated by the rising Beta and potentially diversify their portfolio accordingly.  Further due diligence, including analysis of the reasons behind the recent price drop and the lower ROE in the last quarter, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
