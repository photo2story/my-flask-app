**4. Recent Earnings & Outlook:**

| Date | EPS | Expected EPS |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-08-01 | 1.1 | 0.92 |
| 2024-05-02 | 1.03 | 0.91 |
| 2024-02-15 | 0.64 | 0.6 |

| 2023-08-03 | 0.79 | 0.75 |

The most recent earnings report (2024-08-01) shows that SO beat analysts' expectations by 19% with EPS of 1.1 vs. expected 0.92. This strong performance suggests positive momentum in the company's earnings. However, it's important to note that this is just one data point and further observation is needed to assess long-term trends.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

SO's recent earnings beat expectations, indicating a potential positive trend. However, the stock's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 in recent years. The current price movement suggests a short-term downward trend, but the RSI and PPO are neutral, indicating no strong signals. Investors should monitor the stock's performance and wait for more concrete signals before making investment decisions. 

**6. Recommendations:**

SO's performance has been underwhelming compared to the broader market. While the recent earnings beat is encouraging, it's not enough to recommend a buy. Investors should observe the stock's performance and wait for more confirming signals, such as a sustained upward price trend and improved technical indicators, before considering investment.
