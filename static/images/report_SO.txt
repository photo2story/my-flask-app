The current price is near its moving averages, with technical indicators providing a somewhat mixed signal.  Financial statements show strong profitability but some volatility in revenue and ROE.  The 1% expected return is relatively modest, which might require a careful evaluation of the risk tolerance for long-term investment.  Further investigation into the company's regulatory environment, future growth prospects, and dividend policy would be beneficial before making any investment decisions.
