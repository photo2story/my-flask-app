* **20-day Moving Average:** $89.97

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)

* **PPO:** -0.35 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)

SO has demonstrated strong historical performance compared to the S&P 500, with a significantly higher cumulative return.  While recent price action suggests a potential short-term downward trend, the company's consistent positive earnings surprises and generally high profit margins are positive indicators.  However, current technical indicators point to a higher risk profile. The long-term outlook, based on the expected return, is positive, suggesting SO could be a worthwhile consideration for long-term investors, but further analysis and risk tolerance assessment are needed.  The observed volatility in ROE should also be considered.
