**Analysis:**

*   **Underperformance:** SO has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 in cumulative return.
*   **Alpha:** The Alpha values show a mixed picture. Some periods show SO outperforming its expected return based on its beta, but recent periods (2022-2025) show significant *underperformance* relative to its beta.  The most recent period (2023-2025) is particularly concerning with a -56% alpha.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally low (close to zero), indicating that SO's price is less volatile than the overall market. This suggests it is a more stable, defensive stock, which can underperform in strong bull markets like the one the S&P 500 has experienced.
*   **CAGR & MDD:** Fluctuating rates. The growth rate has varied significantly over different periods. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during each period, showing varying levels of risk.  MDD has recently reduced which could be a good sign for future investment.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap is growing overall.

**Analysis:**

*   **Longer-Term Trend:** The 60-day SMA is significantly higher than both the 5-day and 20-day SMAs.  This suggests a longer-term downward trend, as the recent price is below the average price of the last 60 days.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Divergence Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 64.81 (Approaching overbought territory, but not there yet)

**Analysis:**

*   **Medium Risk:** The MRI suggests a moderate level of risk.
*   **Momentum:** The RSI indicates increasing momentum, and is heading towards an overbought zone.
*   **Potential Uptrend:** The positive PPO and recent increase in divergence suggest a potential short-term uptrend.
*   **High Expected Return:** The very high expected return is noteworthy.  It suggests the model believes SO is currently undervalued relative to its potential future performance and compared to the S&P 500. This could be due to a period of bad earnings and potential to revert to the mean.
