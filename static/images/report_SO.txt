* **20-Day Moving Average:** $90.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $88.38

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent stability. It is notably higher than the 60-day average, indicating a recent upward trend.  The closing price shows a minor decrease (-0.79) compared to the previous close.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-02-20 | 0.5 | 0.506 | -0.006 |

| 2024-02-15 | 0.64 | 0.6 | 0.04 |

In several quarters, SO has exceeded EPS expectations.  This suggests positive earnings momentum.  However, the recent Q1 2025 EPS slightly missed expectations.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reason behind this miss.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Southern Company (SO) demonstrates a strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent price action shows a slight pullback, the overall outlook is moderately bullish, supported by positive earnings surprises in several quarters and a strong long-term expected return. However, careful monitoring of the recent dip in Q4 2024 revenue and profit margins and the Q1 2025 EPS miss is necessary. The high profitability and relatively stable revenue suggest a resilient company.  Long-term investors seeking exposure to the energy sector might consider SO, but further due diligence considering the recent minor negative trends is recommended.  Thorough understanding of the regulatory environment and potential impact of future fuel costs is crucial for informed investment decisions.
