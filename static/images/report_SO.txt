*   **News impact:**

**Recommendation:**

Given the underperformance, mixed analyst sentiment, and medium risk, a **Hold** recommendation appears justified.  However, the oversold condition and high potential long-term return warrant further investigation. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions. The recent rebound could indicate a shift in momentum, but more confirmation is needed. Pay close attention to future news and analyst reports.
