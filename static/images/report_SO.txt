*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuates considerably.  The later years (2022-2025) show lower growth compared to earlier periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values across all periods indicate significant price volatility and potential for large losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:**  SO has significantly underperformed the market (negative Alpha) in recent periods (2022-2025), particularly the last period with a very large negative Alpha. Alpha represents the excess return of the investment compared to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, suggesting that SO's price movements are less sensitive to overall market movements (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization in Billions):** Market capitalization has generally increased over time, suggesting overall growth in the company's value, but this doesn't translate to market-beating returns.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** $87.17
*   **Change:** $0.0 (No change from the previous close)
*   **5-day SMA:** $86.35
*   **20-day SMA:** $86.65
*   **60-day SMA:** $91.44

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), but well below the 60-day SMA. This *could* indicate a short-term upward trend but a longer-term downward or sideways trend. The lack of change from the previous close suggests a period of consolidation.

**3. Technical Indicators and Market Risk**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended). This suggests, according to this indicator, that the overall market conditions are favorable for investment. However, this indicator is contradicted by the Alpha value (-61.0% in 2023-2025) and underperformance of SO compared to VOO (S&P 500).
*   **RSI:** 54.31 (Neutral).  An RSI around 50 indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** 0.42 (Slightly Positive). PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) being slightly positive suggests a minor upward momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (11 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01). This signal recommends a full investment strategy, allocating 100% of available cash to purchase shares, deeming it a very safe option, potentially due to the high MRI.
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** 1.4 (+) (Short-term increase). This indicates a recent, slight improvement in SO's performance relative to its comparison.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 218.7%.  This is a very high expected return, suggesting a potentially optimistic outlook for long-term investment in SO. It's crucial to understand the assumptions behind this projection.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

The provided news headlines are mostly related to the broader market and other individual stocks. While some headlines mention market growth and potential bubbles ("Stock prices have grown rapidly"), none are directly related to Southern Co. The other headlines relate to Oracle, Microsoft, Kroger, and Lumentum, providing no direct insight into SO.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 2.74 (~Hold)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 20
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** $96.72 / $109.00 / $76.00

**Analysis:** Analyst opinions are neutral, with a consensus rating of "Hold." The average target price suggests a potential upside from the current price, but the range is quite wide, indicating uncertainty. The lack of recent rating changes suggests that analysts have not significantly altered their views on the stock recently.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis & Summary**

Southern Co. (SO) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Underperformance:** SO has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the examined period. The negative Alpha values and divergence data highlight this.
*   **Volatility:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate significant price volatility, suggesting potential risk.
*   **Recent Improvement:** There's some evidence of recent short-term positive momentum (slight positive PPO, recent divergence change).
*   **Analyst Neutrality:** Analysts have a neutral "Hold" rating, suggesting no strong buy or sell signals.
*    **Market Risk Indicator Contradiction:** A very high Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 1.0, suggests that the overall market conditions are favorable for investment, is contradicted by the Alpha value and underperformance of SO compared to VOO (S&P 500).

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data provided, Southern Co. does *not* appear to be a compelling investment compared to the broader market (S&P 500). While there are some signs of recent short-term improvement, the historical underperformance, high volatility, and neutral analyst ratings suggest caution. While the "Expected Return" is very high, this should be carefully scrutinized, as it may not be based on current market conditions. It is important to consider whether a high investment recommendation based on a Market Risk Indicator (MRI) is credible, as this indicator may contradict the underperformance of SO compared to VOO (S&P 500). Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before investing in SO. A deeper dive into the reasons for the historical underperformance and the assumptions behind the high expected return is warranted.
