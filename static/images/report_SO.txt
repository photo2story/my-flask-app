## Southern Company (SO) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Southern Company (SO) is an American energy company primarily engaged in electricity generation and distribution.  The provided data shows SO underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Further analysis will delve into the reasons behind this underperformance and provide a more comprehensive view.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SO's cumulative return (87.49%) lagged behind the S&P 500's return (117.48%) by approximately 30 percentage points. The provided data shows that the relative underperformance currently sits at the 25.5th percentile of historical relative performance, indicating that while underperforming, it's not at the extreme end of historical underperformance.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market.  While periods of positive alpha (outperformance) occurred (e.g., 2017-2019, 2018-2020), other periods showed significant underperformance (negative alpha). The beta consistently hovers around 0.5, indicating lower volatility than the overall market.  The company's market capitalization is shown to have steadily increased over time.  The CAGR values show variability in annual growth, highlighting the need for a deeper investigation into the underlying factors.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $83.93
* **5-day Moving Average:** $83.84
* **20-day Moving Average:** $83.07
* **60-day Moving Average:** $84.69

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent minor downward trend.  It's also below its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downward trend. The 20-day moving average lies below both, further supporting the downward trend. The recent price change reflects a minor decrease (-0.02%).  No significant price volatility or sharp changes were observed.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 56.30  (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.26 (Slightly positive, suggesting a bullish momentum but weak)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -6.6% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -23.8% (This reflects the very recent price movement and not a long-term projection.)


Given the current price movement, no immediate concerns of significant volatility (sharp uptrend or downtrend) exist, however, it's crucial to monitor the price closely in relation to the moving averages. The negative expected return is solely based on the single day's movement and should not be interpreted as a long-term projection. The long-term (2+ years) expected excess return versus the S&P 500 is not provided in the dataset.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

SO's performance has lagged the S&P 500, although not exceptionally so compared to its historical performance range.  Despite this underperformance, the company shows consistent positive earnings surprises and healthy financial metrics. The relatively low beta suggests lower volatility compared to the broader market.  However, the inconsistent alpha suggests that outperformance relative to the market is not guaranteed.  Further analysis would need to include factors like dividend yields and future earnings projections to provide a complete investment recommendation. The recent price action indicates a minor downward trend, warranting close monitoring. The strength of the financials and the consistent earnings beats suggest a more nuanced view is required than a simple comparison to the S&P 500's return alone.
