This report analyzes Southern Company (SO), a leading U.S. utility company providing electricity to millions of customers across multiple states.  The analysis incorporates historical performance data, recent financial results, and technical indicators to offer a comprehensive overview.


**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Southern Company's cumulative return (90.46%) over the analyzed period underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 121.09%.  The difference is -30.6%, placing it at the 24.7th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a provided minimum of -49.1% and maximum of 25.7%).  This suggests underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently shows 0.0 which means that the stock showed no excess return compared to the benchmark.  Beta data shows that its movement was often less volatile than the market given its low beta values.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $84.93
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $84.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $82.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $84.81

The closing price is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating recent price stability or minor upward trend.  However, the price is above the 20-day moving average suggesting short term upward momentum.  The price change from the previous close ($2.54 increase) suggests a recent positive price movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.43 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.37 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +10.4 (Positive, indicating short-term upward momentum)

The recent price increase ('change' value) indicates a short-term upward move, aligning with the positive PPO and Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence.  However, the expected return of -24.9% over a long-term (2+ years) horizon relative to the S&P 500 suggests potential underperformance in the future.  This negative return is likely linked to the generally low returns compared to the market as explained in the first section.
