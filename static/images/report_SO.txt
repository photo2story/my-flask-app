This report analyzes Southern Company (SO), a major gas and electric utility company providing energy services across the southeastern United States, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Southern Company's cumulative return (106.25%) lags behind the S&P 500's cumulative return (130.06%) by 23.8 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -23.8% places it in the 38.5th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (ranging from -53.4% to 23.4%).  This indicates underperformance compared to the market benchmark. The consistently near-zero alpha values across the provided years further highlight this relative underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $89.13 (Last market: $89.38)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $88.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.77
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $88.99

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, and above the 20-day moving average, suggesting some short-term consolidation or minor downward pressure.  The difference between the last market price ($89.38) and the closing price ($89.13) is negligible and does not indicate any significant recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 57.75 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.32 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** NaN (-), suggesting recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates no expected excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term; this may reflect the inherent stability, but also lack of high growth potential, typical of utility stocks.)

The RSI and PPO suggest a relatively neutral to slightly positive outlook. However, the negative relative divergence indicates recent short-term weakness.  The 0% expected return highlights the potential for relatively stable, but possibly less exciting growth compared to the broader market.
