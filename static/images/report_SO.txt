**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $88.40
* 5-Day Moving Average: $86.83
* 20-Day Moving Average: $85.22
* 60-Day Moving Average: $84.34

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The recent price increase of $0.66 (from $87.82) indicates a minor positive shift.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* RSI: 75.84 –  Indicates overbought conditions, suggesting potential for a price correction.
* PPO: 0.39 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* 20-Day Relative Divergence Change: +9.6% –  Shows a recent increase in relative strength.

The substantial positive change in the price combined with the high RSI suggests a recent period of rapid price appreciation, potentially indicating a short-term overbought condition. The expected return of -13.5% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 indicates potential underperformance compared to the broader market even with the recent upward price movement.  This should be interpreted cautiously due to the limitations of prediction.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Southern Company (SO) shows mixed signals. While it exhibits strong profitability and consistent earnings beats, its performance relative to the S&P 500 has been underwhelming, particularly in the long run. The recent price surge, indicated by the high RSI and positive price change, might be a short-term phenomenon.  The negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 is a significant concern for long-term investors.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for the relative underperformance compared to the S&P 500, along with broader macroeconomic factors and sector-specific analysis, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The data provided suggests caution regarding the current elevated price levels.
