**5) Financial Information:**

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

SO has shown inconsistent performance compared to the S&P 500, underperforming considerably in the longer term. While recent earnings have exceeded expectations, the lack of broader financial data hinders a complete assessment. The relatively low RSI and negative expected return suggest caution. The relatively consistent beta indicates sensitivity to market movements.  Further investigation into the underlying reasons for the persistent underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and access to total revenue and gross profit data are crucial before making any investment decisions. The relatively low and stable beta makes it a reasonable choice for investors wanting to reduce their overall portfolio volatility.
