## Southern Company (SO) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Southern Company (SO), a leading U.S. utility company providing electricity to millions of customers.  

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Southern Company's cumulative return (115.14%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) return (82.57%) by 32.57 percentage points.  The relative divergence, considering historical highs and lows, places this outperformance at the 63.4th percentile. This suggests SO's performance has been considerably stronger than the broader market over the observed period.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance across different timeframes.  While Alpha (excess return relative to the market) is generally positive (0.2-0.3), reflecting outperformance, Beta (market sensitivity) is consistently around 0.39-0.1, indicating relatively lower market sensitivity than the average stock. However, the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant fluctuation. The high CAGR in some periods (e.g., 2017-2019, 2018-2020) is offset by lower growth in others (e.g., 2016-2018, 2022-2024).  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows steady growth.  The Max Drawdown (MDD) numbers suggest periods of significant risk.  More detailed analysis and deeper investigation of these periods is necessary to fully understand these fluctuations.



**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $91.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $91.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $90.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $88.51

The closing price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downward trend. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a positive medium to long-term trend.  The recent price change (-$0.09) indicates a slight downward movement, but not significant enough to classify as a rapid decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)  Suggests moderate risk associated with the stock.
* **RSI:** 45.29 (Near neutral, slightly below the 50 threshold indicating a slightly bearish sentiment.)
* **PPO:** 0.10 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -6.5% (Short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** 23.5% (This represents the projected long-term excess return compared to the S&P 500 over 2+ years)

The combination of indicators paints a mixed picture. While the expected return is significantly positive, the short-term indicators suggest some caution.  The negative recent price change reinforces this short-term bearish signal.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Southern Company (SO) shows a strong long-term performance record exceeding the S&P 500.  The positive expected return, strong earnings generally exceeding expectations, and healthy financial statements support the continued potential for outperformance.  However, recent short-term indicators suggest a cautious approach.  The volatility in CAGR and MDD highlights the inherent risks in the utility sector and the importance of risk management in long-term investment strategies.  Further research and consideration of individual risk tolerance are crucial before making any investment decisions.
