**Note:**  To complete the analysis,  the S&P 500's Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for each period needs to be provided for a direct comparison with SO's CAGR. The Alpha values suggest periods of outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha) relative to the market, considering its beta.  The negative Alphas indicate underperformance compared to the market benchmark.  Beta values are consistently low, suggesting lower volatility compared to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $88.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $88.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $85.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $83.74

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent minor downward trend. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potentially bullish longer-term trend.  A recent price drop of -$0.51 from the previous close is observed.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 74.18 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.38 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +13.8% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -9.5% (Expected to underperform S&P 500 over the long term)


The high RSI value indicates the stock might be overbought, suggesting potential for a correction.  The positive PPO confirms the short-term upward momentum. However, the negative expected return highlights the potential for underperformance against the S&P 500 in the long run. The recent price drop of -$0.51 indicates a minor correction, but not necessarily a significant downward trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|---------|---------------|------------|
| 2025-02-20 | 0.5     | 0.506         | Slight Miss |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.43    | 1.34          | Beat        |
| 2024-08-01 | 1.1     | 0.92          | Beat        |
| 2024-05-02 | 1.03    | 0.91          | Beat        |
| 2024-02-15 | 0.64    | 0.6           | Beat        |

Southern Company has consistently beaten or met earnings expectations in recent quarters, except for the most recent one. This suggests generally positive performance, but the slight miss on the last report warrants attention.

**Note:**  To complete this analysis, data from the previous year is required to calculate year-over-year growth rates for revenue, profit margin, equity, and ROE.  This would provide more context on the company's financial performance trends.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Southern Company shows mixed signals. While it has generally strong earnings and relatively stable financial performance, its cumulative return has lagged behind the S&P 500 over the observed period. The stock's valuation (relative to the S&P 500) and its projected long-term underperformance against the market raise concerns.  Further investigation into the reasons for lagging performance and a deeper dive into the company's future growth prospects are necessary before making any investment decisions. The relatively high RSI suggests caution, recommending monitoring for potential price corrections.  The availability of the missing data points (previous year's financial data and S&P 500 CAGRs) would greatly enhance the accuracy and completeness of this analysis.
