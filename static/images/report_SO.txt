Southern Company (SO) is an American energy company primarily engaged in electricity generation and distribution.  Over the analyzed period, SO significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return 32.6% higher.  The relative divergence of 63.4% highlights this outperformance relative to the historical range of performance differences.

The medium risk assessment, combined with the relatively high long-term expected return, suggests a potentially favorable investment opportunity for long-term investors with a moderate risk tolerance.  However, further due diligence is always recommended before making any investment decisions.  It's important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.
