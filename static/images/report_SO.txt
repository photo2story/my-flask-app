SO's cumulative return of 88.26% lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) at 119.91%, resulting in a current difference of -31.6%.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Southern Company (SO) shows a mixed performance picture.  While it demonstrates consistent earnings beats and strong revenue and profitability, its cumulative return has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern. However, the relatively low beta suggests lower risk compared to the broader market. Further research is necessary to determine whether the current undervaluation presents a buying opportunity.  Investors should carefully weigh the consistent profitability with the historical and projected underperformance relative to the market benchmark before making any investment decisions.
