*   **Alpha:** Alpha values are inconsistent. A negative alpha (especially in the recent period of 2023-2025) indicates underperformance relative to the benchmark, while positive alphas suggest outperformance.
*   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuate around 0, indicating very low correlation with the market. This suggests that the stock's price movements are not strongly tied to the overall market.

*   **20-day SMA:** 87.23
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.97

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is above the current price, indicating recent weakness. The significant difference between the 60-day SMA and the current price reinforces the downtrend.

**3) Technical Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 32.91
*   **PPO:** 0.20
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (11 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.4 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 218.7%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   **RSI:** The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 32.91, indicating that the stock might be nearing oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) at 0.20 suggests the stock price is slightly above its moving averages.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal advises buying, indicating a potentially safe investment, and a monthly investment of a portion of the total.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** A positive divergence change suggests a short-term upward movement relative to the comparison asset.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high expected return (218.7%) should be viewed with caution. This is a model-driven projection and may not accurately reflect real-world potential.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Acquisition by Matrix Trust Co:** Positive, indicates institutional interest, but a relatively small holding.
*   **Georgia families boost:** Positive, but more of a social impact/PR piece.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed. While institutional acquisition is generally positive, the individual amount is not significant. The Georgia families boost highlights the company's commitment to its service area, which could indirectly improve its reputation.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean:** 2.74 (~Hold)
*   **Opinions:** 20
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 96.72 / 109.00 / 76.00

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting that they don't see significant upside or downside potential in the near term. The average target price of $96.72 is above the current price, indicating potential for appreciation, but the range between high and low targets is wide, reflecting uncertainty.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Southern Co has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. The technical indicators suggest a downtrend, but the RSI and the hybrid signal suggest that the stock may be approaching an oversold state and buying opportunity, respectively. The high expected return should be viewed cautiously. Analyst opinions are neutral, with a "Hold" consensus and a target price slightly above the current price.

The news is mixed, with an institutional purchase providing a small positive, and philanthropic community programs delivering social impacts.

**Overall:**

Southern Co appears to be a mixed bag. It has underperformed, is in a downtrend, but has a potentially attractive entry point based on technical indicators and analyst target prices.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a neutral stance or a small opportunistic buy might be warranted, especially if the investor is looking for a long-term, potentially undervalued asset. However, the investor should be aware of the stock's underperformance, high MDD, and the risks associated with the energy sector. Monitoring future earnings reports and sector-specific news will be crucial for making informed investment decisions. The extremely high expected return should not be a primary driver of the investment decision.
