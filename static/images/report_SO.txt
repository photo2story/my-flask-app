**5. Comprehensive Analysis:**

Southern Co. (SO) has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, with a negative divergence of -42.0%.  The historical Alpha values are mostly negative, and the stock is generally less volatile than the market (low Beta).  Recent price action shows a downtrend, with the price below its moving averages.

However, there are conflicting signals. The RSI is approaching oversold territory, and the hybrid signal suggests to buy. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) is at a medium level (0.7).

The news is mixed. Jefferies has lowered expectations, but news about lower electricity bills in Georgia suggests positive regulatory developments.

The high expected return (141.5%) is intriguing but needs further investigation. It's significantly above the typical returns for a utility company and could reflect an undervaluation, expectation of future growth, or simply an error in calculation or projection.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The recommendation is **Neutral to Cautiously Optimistic**.
*   *There are indicators of a potential buying opportunity, but the recent price downtrend, analyst downgrades, and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 must be considered.*

**Further Investigation:**

*   *Investigate the source and methodology of the "Expected Return (%)" of 141.5%.*
