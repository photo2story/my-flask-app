**7. Overall Analysis:**

SO's performance has lagged the S&P 500, with a significant negative expected return relative to the market.

However, the consistently lower performance relative to the market index presents a risk. Further analysis considering recent news and market conditions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The positive trends in profit margin and ROE are encouraging and suggest improved efficiency and profitability, but the lower overall return needs careful consideration.
