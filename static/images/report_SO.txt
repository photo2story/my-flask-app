*   **Company Overview:** Southern Co (SO) is an energy holding company that provides electricity and natural gas.
*   **Return Comparison:** Southern Co.'s cumulative return (57.01%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) return (100.88%), resulting in a divergence of -43.87%.
*   **Divergence Context:**  The divergence is currently at -43.9, with a relative divergence of 4.0. This means the current divergence is near the minimum historically compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

    *   **Alpha:** SO has struggled to generate excess returns compared to its benchmark. The majority of Alpha values are negative (especially recently: -15% and -62%), indicating underperformance.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values fluctuate around zero (most are negative), indicating low volatility relative to the market. The stock is less sensitive to market movements than S&P 500.
    *   **CAGR:** SO has had periods of strong growth (36-54%), but has generally lower single-digit CAGR in recent years.
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant potential for large price declines.
    *   **Cap:** Market Capitalization is steadily growing, indicating growth in the company.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price vs. Moving Averages:** The current price ($85.72) is below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a potential downward trend. The moving averages themselves are also trending downward, reinforcing this signal.

**3. Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** An MRI of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation based on risk, but this might be misleading given the underperformance against the S&P 500.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 32.91 indicates the stock is nearing oversold territory, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.20 indicates the price is slightly above its moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash" signal is a very aggressive recommendation based on the algorithm's specific criteria. However, consider this with the analyst consensus (hold) and other indicators.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** "Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = 1.4 (+): 단기상승" implies a short-term increase, suggesting some recent positive movement relative to the comparison.
*   **Price Fluctuation:** The recent price change (+0.52) indicates a small upward movement.
*   **Expected Return:** An Expected Return of 218.7% is *highly optimistic* and should be viewed with extreme caution. It suggests a potentially significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Georgia Power Expansion:**  The approval for Georgia Power to expand its data center capacity is a positive development, suggesting future growth opportunities.
*   **Valuation Check:** News sources are analyzing the valuation of Southern Co. after the Georgia Power expansion approval. This suggests that investors are actively assessing the impact of this news on the company's stock price.
*   **Stock Declines:** Reports of stock declines in the past 6 months highlight existing concerns about the company's performance.
*   **Other News:** irrelevant news included (e.g. Microsoft and AI stocks)

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," with a mean rating of 2.74. This implies a neutral outlook on the stock.
*   **Target Price:** The average target price is $96.72, which is above the current price, suggesting potential upside. However, the range between the high and low target prices is wide, indicating uncertainty among analysts.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not available in this data.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Southern Co. (SO) is an energy company with a mixed outlook.

*   **Negative Signals:** The most significant concern is the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period of the provided data, as evidenced by the negative divergence. High MDD indicates significant potential for price decline. The company's performance data (Alpha) support this assessment, showing negative returns over the benchmark. The current price being below its moving averages signals a downward trend.
*   **Positive Signals/Neutral Signals:** Analyst consensus is "Hold," and the average target price is above the current price. Recent news regarding Georgia Power's expansion is a positive sign. The MRI of 0.8 suggests medium investment risk.
*   **Considerations:** The extremely high "Expected Return" should be treated with skepticism. The data doesn't specify the model/assumptions used to generate this figure. The "Buy" signal provided by the hybrid signal should be treated with caution and the signal is too aggressive.
*   **News Impact:** The news articles regarding the Georgia Power expansion are the most relevant and potentially positive factor. However, other news indicates past declines in stock value.

**In Conclusion:**

Based on this analysis, Southern Co. presents a mixed investment picture. The company is underperforming the S&P 500. The news about the Georgia Power expansion provides a potential catalyst, but the overall risk profile and recent performance suggest a cautious approach. Investors should carefully weigh the potential benefits against the identified risks.
