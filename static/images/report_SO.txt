| 2018-2020  | 46.0% | 62.1% | 0.3  | 57.1 |       |                          |

The alpha values generally indicate a positive outperformance compared to the market benchmark (S&P 500), except for a few years.  The beta values show a relatively high sensitivity to market movements, especially in recent years.  Note that the CAGR values for the S&P 500 are missing from the provided data, preventing a direct comparison.


**2) Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $87.80
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $88.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $89.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $87.19

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.  The recent price increase (Last-market data) shows a slight positive change of 1.08%, which does not indicate a dramatic price swing (neither a rapid surge nor a sharp drop).


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.77 (Approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.5693 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 12% (Long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to S&P 500)

The combination of a high MRI, low RSI and negative PPO suggests a relatively bearish outlook.  The negative relative divergence change further reinforces this. However, the positive expected return indicates potential long-term growth.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference | Beat/Miss |
|------------|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 2025-02-20 | 0.5    | 0.506        | -0.006      | Miss      |
| 2024-10-31 | 1.43   | 1.34         | 0.09       | Beat      |
| 2024-08-01 | 1.1    | 0.92         | 0.18       | Beat      |
| 2024-05-02 | 1.03   | 0.91         | 0.12       | Beat      |
| 2024-02-15 | 0.64   | 0.6          | 0.04       | Beat      |

Southern Company has consistently beaten or met EPS expectations in recent quarters, except for the latest quarter (Feb 2025).  This indicates a generally positive trend in earnings performance.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue   | Profit Margin | Revenue YoY Growth |
|---------|-----------|---------------|--------------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $6.34B   | 41.96%        |                    |
| 2024-09-30 | $7.27B   | 54.34%        |                    |
| 2024-06-30 | $6.46B   | 53.91%        |                    |
| 2024-03-31 | $6.65B   | 48.81%        |                    |
| 2023-12-31 | $6.04B   | 41.16%        |                    |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE     | Equity YoY Growth |
|---------|-----------|---------|--------------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $33.21B  | 1.61%   |                    |
| 2024-09-30 | $33.30B  | 4.61%   |                    |
| 2024-06-30 | $32.45B  | 3.71%   |                    |
| 2024-03-31 | $31.92B  | 3.54%   |                    |
| 2023-12-31 | $31.44B  | 2.72%   |                    |

Revenue fluctuates but shows overall strength.  Profit margins are generally high, but show some variation.  Equity has increased over the period, and ROE is relatively stable although it fluctuates quarterly.  YoY growth data is missing and would enhance the analysis.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Southern Company (SO) shows a strong historical performance exceeding the S&P 500.  While recent technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, the consistent earnings beats and a positive long-term expected return suggest potential for continued growth. The high beta suggests sensitivity to market fluctuations, which investors should consider.  More complete data, particularly S&P 500 CAGR and YoY growth for SO, would allow for a more comprehensive evaluation.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent EPS miss and the variability in profit margins would also be beneficial.
