**Overall Analysis:**

Schlumberger NV (SLB) is currently underperforming the broader market, as evidenced by its significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO). Although the company has reported solid recent earnings, the short-term technical indicators suggest a potential downtrend.  While the RSI suggests a potential bounce back, the recent negative relative divergence suggests a lack of momentum.  The expected return is positive, however, it's important to consider the macro environment and its potential impact on the oil and gas industry. Investors should closely monitor the company's future earnings reports and any updates to its outlook.
