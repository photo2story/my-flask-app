Despite recent positive earnings, SLB's stock performance has been lagging behind the broader market. This is likely due to various factors, including a decline in oil prices and concerns about the future of the oil and gas industry. 
While technical indicators point to oversold conditions and a potential for short-term rebound, the stock's long-term performance remains a concern.
