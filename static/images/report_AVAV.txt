*   **RSI:** 48.05
*   **PPO:** -0.0798

*   **Expected Return:** 17.3% (Over S&P 500, long-term)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a low-risk market environment.  The RSI of 48.05 indicates a neutral condition, not overbought or oversold.  The negative PPO indicates a slight downward trend in price momentum.  The hybrid signal suggests a cautious stance, recommending a reduction in holdings and increased cash position, likely based on the MRI. The negative change in relative divergence supports the idea of a short-term decline. The expected return of 17.3% (vs. S&P 500) is a positive long-term indicator.
