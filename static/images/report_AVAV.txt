**Analysis of Alpha, Beta, and Key Metrics:**

*   **CAGR & MDD:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) has fluctuated significantly over the years, indicating high volatility. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) remains consistently high, suggesting substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha values are highly variable, reflecting periods of significant outperformance (positive Alpha) and underperformance (negative Alpha) relative to the market.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low (close to zero or slightly positive), suggesting AVAV's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market.  The Beta increasing closer to 1 in later years may indicate a strengthening correlation to the market.

**Analysis:**

The current price is below all three moving averages (5, 20, and 60 day), which is generally considered a bearish signal.  The slight decrease from the previous close (-0.3) is less significant than the fact that the price is substantially below the moving averages.

*   **Expected Return:** 22.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The Market Risk Indicator suggests a "Low Risk" environment, which is a positive sign.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 31.75 indicates that the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) indicates a bearish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends a cautious approach, suggesting maintaining a high cash position and selling a small portion of holdings, aligning with the recent price weakness.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Spread Change:** indicates no change in the very recent time frame.
*   **Expected Return:** An expected return of 22.6% suggests confidence in long-term outperformance, but this should be weighed against the short-term bearish signals.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **[2025-09-05] Earnings Calendar Spotlight:** Indicates upcoming earnings may be a key event.

**Analysis:**

The recent news is a mix of positive developments (product launches, contract deliveries) and negative sentiment ("Shares Getting Obliterated"). This mixed information suggests a period of high volatility and uncertainty. The "Shares Getting Obliterated" headline is a major concern and likely contributes to the recent price weakness.

*   **Mean (1=StrongBuy~5=Sell):** 1.38
*   **Opinions:** 11

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus remains strongly positive, with a "Strong Buy" rating and a mean rating of 1.38.  The average target price of 298.73 suggests significant upside potential. However, the low target price of 225.00 is very close to the current market price, indicating some analysts may be less optimistic.  It's critical to investigate the reasons behind the recent rating changes if possible.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 예상 EPS |
|------------|------|----------|

AVAV has beaten EPS estimates in 3 out of the last 5 quarters. However, there were notable EPS misses in the 2025-03-04 and 2024-12-04 quarters. This mixed performance likely contributes to market uncertainty. The most recent quarter (2025-06-24) shows a significant beat, which is a positive sign, although it may not be enough to offset more recent negative market sentiment.

*   **Relatively Low ROE:** The Return on Equity is volatile and generally low.
*   **High Valuation:** Despite recent price drops, the valuation may still be considered high, requiring careful consideration.
*   **Dependence on Government Contracts:** A significant portion of AVAV's revenue likely comes from government contracts, which can be subject to political and budgetary changes.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted. While the long-term potential remains, the recent negative price action and earnings inconsistencies raise concerns.

*   **For existing shareholders:** Consider reducing exposure slightly, maintaining a high cash position as suggested by the hybrid signal.
*   **For potential investors:** Wait for a clearer signal of recovery before initiating a position. Monitor upcoming earnings and news flow closely. Pay close attention to any further rating changes or analyst commentary.
