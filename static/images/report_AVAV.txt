### 5. 종합 Conclusion

AeroVironment (AVAV) has shown significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in recent periods. The company is operating in a growing market (drones) and has received positive analyst coverage. However, the Hybrid Signal and the decrease in short-term relative deviation suggest some caution is warranted. The relatively high Expected Return, coupled with strong analyst consensus, suggests that long-term investors may find AVAV attractive, but should be aware of the potential risks highlighted by the technical indicators and news articles. Specifically, the Simply Wall St. article questioning the valuation is a key consideration. The recent news events (new ETF launch, price target increase) are likely contributing to the positive price momentum. The overall picture is bullish with some caveats regarding valuation and short-term momentum.
