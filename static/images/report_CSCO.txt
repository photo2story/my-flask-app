The most recent earnings report (2024-05-21) showed **EPS of $0.47**, falling short of analyst expectations. Revenue came in at **$12.70 Billion**. This suggests a potential slowdown in growth for Cisco, which could be a reason for the stock's recent underperformance.

**Overall Analysis:**

Cisco currently faces a challenging environment with lagging returns compared to the broader market. Despite a technically bullish PPO indicator and potential for future growth indicated by the Expected Return, Cisco's recent earnings miss and short-term downtrend in relative strength (Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence) suggest caution. The overbought RSI reading also points to potential near-term price correction. Investors should closely monitor future earnings reports and industry trends to assess the long-term prospects of Cisco.
