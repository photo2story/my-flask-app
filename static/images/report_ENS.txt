## EnerSys (ENS) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

EnerSys (ENS) is a global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications.  The company's cumulative return significantly lags the S&P 500 (VOO).  Recent price action shows the stock trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting bearish momentum.  While recent earnings show growth, profitability metrics and valuation need further scrutiny.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **ENS Cumulative Return:** 16.23%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 78.93%
* **Return Difference:** -62.7%
* **Relative Divergence:** 23.3% (This means ENS's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is in the lower 23rd percentile of its historical range of underperformance.)

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided alpha and beta values show significant volatility in ENS's performance relative to the market (high beta), with periods of both outperformance (positive alpha) and significant underperformance (negative alpha). The high beta suggests ENS is more sensitive to market movements than the overall market.  The inconsistent alpha indicates difficulty in predicting its outperformance consistently.

| 2020-2022  | -9.0% | 73.6% | -1.1 | 2.9 |
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 73.6% | -0.6 | 3.9 |

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $83.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $82.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $85.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $94.24

The stock is currently trading below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The recent price increase of $1.36 (from $82.16) is a positive sign, but it's too early to definitively call it a trend reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.19 (Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so.)
* **PPO:** 0.1671 (Positive, but relatively low, suggesting limited momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** -178.7% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 requires further investigation and context.  It suggests significant underperformance is projected.)  The extremely negative expected return needs clarification; it likely reflects the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 already observed and possibly incorporates assumptions about future underperformance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) shows mixed signals.  While recent earnings demonstrate growth, the stock's significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (-62.7%) and a concerning projected negative long-term expected return are major red flags.  Technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, although the RSI is approaching oversold territory. The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity. Before making any investment decisions,  a more thorough fundamental analysis, including valuation metrics (P/E, P/S, etc.), is crucial to assess the true investment potential of ENS.  The inconsistent alpha and high beta suggest significant risk.  The data provided needs clarification regarding duplicated earnings entries and the extreme negative expected return.
