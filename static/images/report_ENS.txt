**7. 종합 Analysis**

EnerSys (ENS) exhibits a mixed picture. While recent earnings and revenue show positive trends, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.

The recent price surge, indicated by the large change and RSI value, may be followed by a short-term downward correction. The negative expected return is a significant cause for concern and warrants further investigation.

**Recommendation:**

Given the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high volatility, and negative expected return, a cautious approach is warranted. Monitoring upcoming news releases and company announcements will be essential.
