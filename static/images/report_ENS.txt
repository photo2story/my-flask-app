*   **Alpha:** The Alpha is predominantly negative, suggesting that ENS has generally underperformed relative to what would be expected based on its risk (Beta).  The negative Alpha values indicate that ENS has not generated excess returns compared to its benchmark.
*   **Beta:** The Beta varies significantly over the years, ranging from negative values (-1.3 in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024) to positive values (2.8 in 2023-2025). A Beta of less than 1 indicates that the stock is less volatile than the market, while a Beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility.

**Analysis:** The stock price has experienced a slight decrease in the most recent trading session. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which suggests a short-term upward trend. However, the close proximity of the 20-day and 60-day averages warrants caution.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (1 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** 2.7 (+) (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -1170.9%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI indicates a "Low Risk" environment, which is a positive sign.
*   The RSI is at 65.92, approaching the overbought territory (typically above 70). This suggests the stock may be due for a pullback.
*   The PPO is at 0.76, indicating the price is slightly above its moving average.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a cautious buy signal (80% of cash allocation), likely influenced by the MRI.
*   The recent increase in relative divergence indicates a short-term upward trend.
*   **The extremely negative expected return (-1170.9%) is highly unusual and warrants serious investigation.** This figure suggests a very bearish outlook for EnerSys compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon, but it's important to verify the accuracy and methodology behind this calculation. It could be based on specific, negative assumptions about the company's future.
* The price change {'price': 93.64, 'previousClose': 94.05, 'change': -0.44} is small, so it doesn't reflect a significant volatility event.
