**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) is a global manufacturer and distributor of industrial batteries and energy systems.  Over the observed periods, ENS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a cumulative return of 25.27% compared to VOO's 85.44%.  The -60.2% difference places ENS's performance in the 12.7th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to VOO, indicating consistent underperformance relative to the market.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high beta values (consistently above 2.6), indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market movements. Alpha values fluctuate between positive and negative, suggesting inconsistent outperformance or underperformance relative to the market benchmark adjusted for risk.  The consistently high beta suggests the stock price is heavily influenced by broader market trends. The recent positive alpha of 2.1 in 2023-2025 could reflect market sentiment shifts or other factors impacting the stock’s performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

ENS shows a recent downtrend.  The closing price of $83.22 is below all three moving averages:

* **5-Day MA:** $90.68
* **20-Day MA:** $95.46
* **60-Day MA:** $97.17

The significant drop in price (-$9.79) from the previous close highlights a recent negative price movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk) suggests moderate market volatility.
* **RSI (24.16):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a buying opportunity, but it should be considered alongside other factors.
* **PPO (-1.13):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change:** -2.5 suggests a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (-231%):** This extremely negative expected return requires further investigation.  It is highly improbable and likely indicates a flaw in the calculation or underlying assumptions. The significant negative price change could be a factor. This needs clarification.
* **Price Drop:** The recent substantial price drop (-10.53%) warrants further analysis to identify the underlying causes (e.g., market correction, company-specific news, etc.).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 1.38  | $1.08B      |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.26  | $1.04B      |
| 2024-05-01 | 1.22  | $1.01B      |

| 2024-10-24 | 1.14  | $0.94B      | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Earnings show a generally upward trend in both EPS and revenue. However, the duplicate entry for October 24, 2024 needs clarification.  Further investigation is needed to confirm the accuracy of this data.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows slight fluctuations but remains relatively stable. Profit margins are consistently high, ranging from 27% to 33%, indicating strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been steadily increasing. ROE (Return on Equity) is moderate, fluctuating but generally trending upwards.  This is a positive sign of the company’s ability to generate returns from its shareholder equity.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ENS exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with high volatility (high beta). While recent earnings show growth, the negative price movement and extremely negative expected return raise serious concerns. The low RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, potentially presenting a buying opportunity for long-term investors willing to tolerate high risk, especially if the negative expected return is determined to be an error. However, a thorough investigation into the causes of the recent price drop and the extremely negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions. The high beta means that even if long-term prospects are positive, the volatility will remain high, meaning you should only invest what you can afford to lose and have a long time horizon.  Further due diligence, including analysis of industry trends and competitive landscape, is strongly recommended.
