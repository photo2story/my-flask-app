## EnerSys (ENS) Stock Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) is a global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications.  The provided data shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind this divergence.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

* **ENS Cumulative Return:** 12.86%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 66.69%
* **Return Difference:** -53.8%
* **Relative Divergence:** 25.9% (This means ENS's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is in the 25.9th percentile of its historical range, indicating considerable underperformance.)


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows high Beta values (mostly above 2.5), indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  While some periods show positive Alpha (outperformance), the recent years (2019-2023) consistently show negative Alpha, implying underperformance relative to the market.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $82.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $82.16
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $90.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $95.95

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent slight increase (+$0.22) is not significant enough to signal a reversal of the trend.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 29.58 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce but not confirming a trend reversal.)
* **PPO:** -0.8951 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -9.3% (Short-term downtrend.)
* **Expected Return:** -135.5% (This extremely negative value suggests a very pessimistic outlook relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This requires further investigation as it is unusually low.)

The small price increase needs to be analyzed in context of the overall downtrend. It is premature to conclude a significant trend reversal based solely on this single-day data.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | $1.38 | $1.08 Billion |
| 2024-07-25 | $1.26 | $1.04 Billion |
| 2024-05-01 | $1.22 | $1.01 Billion |
| 2023-10-25 | $1.14 | $0.94 Billion |
| 2024-10-24 | $1.14 | $0.94 Billion *(Duplicate Entry)* |

Earnings have shown a generally upward trend, though there seems to be a duplicate entry.  Further analysis would be required to verify the data accuracy.

Equity is relatively stable, while ROE fluctuates.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) is currently significantly underperforming the S&P 500.  While recent earnings show growth, technical indicators suggest a bearish trend. The high Beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  The extremely negative projected long-term return (-135.5%) needs further verification and context.  Before making any investment decisions, a more in-depth analysis is crucial, considering macroeconomic factors, industry trends, and a deeper dive into the company's financials and future prospects.  The -135.5% expected return needs clarification and further analysis before drawing any conclusions.  The provided data alone does not justify such a pessimistic projection.
