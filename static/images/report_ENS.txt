## EnerSys (ENS) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Preliminary Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) is a global manufacturer and distributor of stored energy solutions.  The provided data reveals significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with a large negative divergence.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons behind this underperformance and assess future potential.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

* **ENS Cumulative Return:** 18.38%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 82.57%
* **Return Divergence:** -64.2% (relative divergence: 22.0%)

ENS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  The relative divergence of 22.0% indicates that the current underperformance is relatively high compared to historical fluctuations between ENS and VOO.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show inconsistent performance relative to the market (VOO).  High beta values (generally above 2) suggest high market sensitivity.  Negative alpha values in several periods indicate underperformance relative to the market's risk-adjusted return.  The recent positive alpha in 2023-2025 is encouraging but needs further investigation.  Note that CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies significantly across periods, indicating volatility in ENS's performance.  High Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) further confirm significant volatility and risk.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 15.0% | 13.4% | -18.0% | 2.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 29.0% | 62.7% | 8.0% | 2.9 |
| 2017-2019  | -21.0% | 62.7% | -55.0% | 2.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 8.0% | 62.7% | -22.0% | 3.1 |
| 2019-2021  | -23.0% | 59.4% | -84.0% | 3.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -9.0% | 73.6% | -1.1 | 2.9 |
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 73.6% | -0.6 | 3.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 26.0% | 73.6% | -0.2 | 3.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $85.94
* **5-day Moving Average:** $82.78
* **20-day Moving Average:** $85.02
* **60-day Moving Average:** $94.08

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a relatively neutral short-term trend. However, it's significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a downward trend in the medium term.  The recent price increase from the previous close ($83.28 to $85.94) shows a minor positive movement (3.19), not significant enough to be considered a sharp rebound.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 54.41 (slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.557 (positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Divergence:** -3.5 (short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -192.9% (This is a highly negative figure and requires further clarification on how it was calculated.  It suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years)).

The conflicting signals from the indicators (positive PPO but negative relative strength divergence) indicate uncertainty about the short-term direction. The extremely negative expected return needs further explanation and validation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue. However, there's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24. This needs clarification.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this growth and its impact on the stock price.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) shows considerable underperformance compared to the S&P 500, characterized by high volatility and inconsistent profitability. While recent earnings suggest growth, the substantial negative expected return and high beta raise significant concerns. The conflicting technical indicators do not provide a clear short-term direction.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough investigation into the reasons for the underperformance, including industry-specific factors and company-specific news, is crucial. The -192.9% expected return figure needs further clarification and verification.  A deeper dive into the financial statements and future projections is highly recommended before making investment decisions.
