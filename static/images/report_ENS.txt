## EnerSys (ENS) Stock Report

This report analyzes EnerSys (ENS), a leading global provider of stored energy solutions for industrial applications.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

EnerSys' cumulative return (15.41%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (72.42%) resulting in a considerable lag of -57.0 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -28% indicates that its performance sits in the lower 28th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta consistently above 2.6, indicating higher volatility than the market). While periods of high CAGR (e.g., 2016-2018) are evident, significant negative CAGRs and high Maximum Drawdowns (MDDs) show substantial risk.  The positive Alpha in 2023-2025 suggests outperformance during that specific period, but this needs further investigation given the overall trend.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 15.0% | 13.4% | -18.0% | 0.1 | 2.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 29.0% | 62.7% | 8.0% | 0.8 | 3.0 |
| 2017-2019  | -21.0% | 62.7% | -55.0% | 1.8 | 2.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 8.0% | 62.7% | -22.0% | 0.0 | 3.3 |
| 2019-2021  | -23.0% | 59.4% | -84.0% | -0.9 | 3.1 |
| 2020-2022  | -9.0% | 73.6% | -18.0% | -1.1 | 3.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 73.6% | -12.0% | -0.6 | 4.1 |
| 2022-2024  | 26.0% | 73.6% | 6.0% | -0.2 | 3.8 |
| 2023-2025  | 8.0% | 77.2% | 2.9 | 3.3 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is $79.89.  The stock has experienced a recent decline, closing down $3.33 from the previous close of $82.64.  The moving averages indicate a downtrend: the 5-day MA ($82.18) is above the current price, the 20-day MA ($87.07) is even further above, and the 60-day MA ($94.78) is significantly higher, suggesting a bearish momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI (33.77) suggests the stock is in oversold territory.  The negative PPO (-0.28) reinforces the bearish trend.  The recent relative divergence of +4.6% suggests a short-term upward trend, potentially a temporary bounce from the oversold conditions. The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.4082 falls in the medium-risk category. The significant price drop (-3.33) indicates a recent decline, but not necessarily a crash. The expected return of -138.6% is extremely negative and needs further clarification on its calculation methodology.  It highly likely reflects the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the specified time frame (likely more than 2 years given the wording).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

EPS and revenue show a general upward trend, though the data for Oct 24th, 2024, appears duplicated.  Further clarification on the data is needed.


| Date       | EPS | Revenue      |
|------------|-----|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 1.38 | $1.08B        |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.26 | $1.04B        |
| 2024-05-01 | 1.22 | $1.01B        |
| 2023-10-25 | 1.14 | $0.94B        |
| 2024-10-24 | 1.14 | $0.94B        | *(Duplicate?)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable, while profit margins show some fluctuation but generally stay above 27%.  Equity is steadily increasing, and ROE, although volatile, indicates profitability.  Further analysis is required to determine the sustainability of these trends.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin | Equity | ROE |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.91B | 32.91%       | $1.84B | 6.22% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.88B | 28.53%       | $1.84B | 4.48% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.85B | 27.95%       | $1.81B | 3.88% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.91B | 27.92%       | $1.75B | 3.47% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.86B | 28.86%       | $1.73B | 4.41% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

EnerSys shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, marked by periods of both strong growth and considerable losses.  While recent earnings suggest positive momentum, the stock's high volatility (indicated by beta and MDD), currently oversold conditions (RSI), and negative PPO signal caution.  The extremely negative projected return (-138.6%) warrants careful scrutiny of its calculation.  Before considering long-term investment, a thorough evaluation of the company's future prospects, competitive landscape, and the validity of the projected return is crucial.  A long-term investment strategy should carefully consider the significant risk involved, given its historical volatility and underperformance relative to the market.
