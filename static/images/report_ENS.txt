## EnerSys (ENS) Stock Report

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

EnerSys (ENS) is a leading global manufacturer and distributor of industrial batteries and energy systems.  The company's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price action shows the stock trading below its key moving averages, suggesting potential downside risk.  Financial indicators reveal mixed signals, with declining PPO and RSI suggesting bearish momentum, but improving EPS and revenue signaling potential underlying strength.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 66.94%
* **Return Difference:** -53.1%
* **Relative Divergence:** 26.6% (This indicates ENS's underperformance relative to VOO is in the lower 26.6% of its historical range of underperformance.)


The provided alpha and beta analysis shows high beta values (generally above 2.6), indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market movements. While some periods showed positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), recent years have consistently shown negative alpha, highlighting underperformance against the benchmark.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) presents a mixed picture.  While the company shows improving fundamental performance (increasing EPS and Revenue), its stock price significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered.  The high beta and negative alpha suggest high volatility and consistent underperformance relative to the market. Recent price action shows the stock below its moving averages, and technical indicators present mixed signals.  The extremely negative expected return (-130.7%) needs further investigation and clarification.  Before making any investment decisions, a more thorough analysis of the -130.7% expected return calculation, the duplicated earnings entry, and the reasons for the recent price jump is necessary.  A longer-term perspective and a deeper dive into the company's competitive landscape and future growth prospects are crucial.  The high risk indicated by the MRI should also be carefully considered.
