## EnerSys (ENS) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) is a global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications.  The provided data reveals a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO). While ENS shows a cumulative return of 16.11%, VOO boasts a 76.31% return, resulting in a considerable gap.  Further analysis is needed to determine the causes and potential future performance.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return Difference:** ENS underperformed VOO by approximately 60.2 percentage points as of the last data point. The relative divergence of -60.2% places ENS in the 25.4th percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The table shows inconsistent alpha and a relatively high beta (around 2.8-3.0 on average), suggesting high market sensitivity. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others reveal significant underperformance.  The high beta implies ENS's returns are heavily influenced by overall market movements.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 15.0% | 13.4% | -18.0% | 0.1 | 2.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 29.0% | 62.7% | 8.0% | 0.8 | 2.9 |
| 2017-2019  | -21.0% | 62.7% | -55.0% | 1.8 | 2.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 8.0% | 62.7% | -22.0% | 0.0 | 3.2 |
| 2019-2021  | -23.0% | 59.4% | -84.0% | -0.9 | 3.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -9.0% | 73.6% | -18.0% | -1.1 | 2.9 |
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 73.6% | -12.0% | -0.6 | 4.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 26.0% | 73.6% | 6.0% | -0.2 | 3.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 9.0% | 77.2% | 2.8 | 3.3 | 3.3 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $82.16
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $82.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $86.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $94.50

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $2.84 (from $79.89) indicates a short-term upward bounce, but the longer-term trend appears bearish.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.19 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.085 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +2.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -158.9% (This extremely negative figure needs further clarification.  It likely represents a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon, not a prediction of absolute losses.)  The provided data implies a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500, especially over a long-term horizon (2+ years).

The recent price jump needs to be considered in context with the overall bearish trend. While it might represent a temporary reversal, it's unlikely to change the long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 without a significant change in the underlying fundamentals.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows a generally increasing trend in both EPS and revenue.  However, there is a duplication of the October 24th data point.  Further investigation is needed to confirm the accuracy of the provided data.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-24 | 1.38 | 1.08 B$ |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.26 | 1.04 B$ |
| 2024-05-01 | 1.22 | 1.01 B$ |
| 2023-10-25 | 1.14 | 0.94 B$ |
| 2024-10-24 | 1.14 | 0.94 B$ |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability indicators show some fluctuation but generally stable performance.  Profit margins are relatively healthy, hovering around 28-33%. ROE is also relatively stable but modest.  Further analysis is needed to determine if this is sufficient for justifying the current valuation.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $0.91B | 32.91% |
| 2024-09-30 | $0.88B | 28.53% |
| 2024-06-30 | $0.85B | 27.95% |
| 2024-03-31 | $0.91B | 27.92% |
| 2023-12-31 | $0.86B | 28.86% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $1.84B | 6.22% |
| 2024-09-30 | $1.84B | 4.48% |
| 2024-06-30 | $1.81B | 3.88% |
| 2024-03-31 | $1.75B | 3.47% |
| 2023-12-31 | $1.73B | 4.41% |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

EnerSys (ENS) shows inconsistent performance relative to the S&P 500. While recent earnings indicate growth, the stock's significantly lower cumulative return and high beta suggest considerable market risk. The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500, based on the provided data, raises concerns.  Further investigation into the -158.9% expected return figure and clarification of the duplicated earnings data are crucial.  Technical indicators point towards an oversold condition but don't negate the long-term underperformance relative to the market benchmark. A long-term investment in ENS requires a careful consideration of its high market sensitivity and the need for substantial improvement in outperformance against the S&P 500.  More in-depth fundamental analysis and a comprehensive valuation are needed before making any investment decisions.
