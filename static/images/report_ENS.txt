* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 76.18%
* **Return Difference (ENS vs VOO):** -59.9%

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) is a global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications.  Over the observed periods, ENS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a cumulative return of 16.26% compared to VOO's 76.18%.  The difference (-59.9%) places ENS's performance in the lower quartile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others display significant negative alpha, indicating periods of underperformance.  The high beta (consistently above 2.0) suggests ENS is significantly more volatile than the overall market.  This volatility contributes to large maximum drawdowns (MDD).

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 15.0% | 13.4% | -18.0% | 0.1 | 2.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 29.0% | 62.7% | 8.0% | 2.9 |
| 2017-2019  | -21.0% | 62.7% | -55.0% | 1.8 | 2.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 8.0% | 62.7% | -22.0% | 0.0 | 3.1 |
| 2019-2021  | -23.0% | 59.4% | -84.0% | -0.9 | 3.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -9.0% | 73.6% | -18.0% | -1.1 | 2.9 |
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 73.6% | -12.0% | -0.6 | 3.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 26.0% | 73.6% | 6.0% | -0.2 | 3.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 9.0% | 77.2% | 2.9 | 3.3 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $82.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $82.71
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $95.12

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates recent price stability, but the larger gap to the 20 and 60-day moving averages suggests a broader bearish trend.  The recent price increase of $0.63 compared to the previous close (a slight upward movement) is relatively small given the overall downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4244 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 34.95 (Below 30, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.24 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +2.0 (Short-term upward trend, but needs confirmation)
* **Expected Return (vs S&P 500, long-term):** -157.3% This extremely negative expected return requires further investigation and may reflect underlying assumptions not fully defined.

The technical indicators present a mixed picture.  The low RSI suggests potential for a bounce, while the negative PPO and position below moving averages point to continued bearish momentum. The significant negative long-term expected return is alarming and needs clarification on the methodology used to arrive at this figure.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ENS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While recent earnings show improvement, the stock's high beta and inconsistent alpha suggest significant risk.  Technical indicators paint a mixed picture, with some suggesting oversold conditions and potential for a rebound, while others point to continued bearish momentum. The extremely negative long-term expected return figure requires further investigation and clarification.  Before considering any investment in ENS, a thorough review of the data discrepancies, the methodology behind the -157.3% expected return calculation, and a comprehensive assessment of the company's long-term prospects is necessary.  The high volatility inherent in ENS makes it unsuitable for risk-averse investors.
