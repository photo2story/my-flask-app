## EnerSys (ENS) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** EnerSys is a global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications.  This report analyzes ENS's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) using provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

EnerSys (ENS) has accumulated a total return of 33.54%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has returned 91.19%.  This represents a significant underperformance of -57.7%, placing it at the 15.2nd percentile of its historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (max -29.1%, min -73.2%).

The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals high volatility and a beta consistently above 2, suggesting ENS is significantly more sensitive to market fluctuations than the overall market.  While periods of strong outperformance exist (e.g., 2016-2018), periods of significant underperformance are also prevalent (e.g., 2017-2019, 2019-2021).  The recent positive alpha in 2023-2025 may be an outlier requiring further investigation.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent earnings show some growth, the high beta and consistent underperformance suggest considerable market risk. The technical indicators point towards a bearish short-term trend, although the oversold RSI suggests a potential bounce.  The extremely negative expected return (-186.3%) is alarming and needs further clarification. Before making any investment decisions, it is crucial to investigate the reasons behind this extreme negative expectation, review additional financial statements, and conduct thorough fundamental analysis.  A long-term, disciplined approach with careful risk management would be advisable, especially considering its high sensitivity to market movements.
