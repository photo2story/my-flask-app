**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

EnerSys (ENS) is a global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications.  Over the period analyzed, ENS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 31.70% compared to VOO's 89.44%.  This represents a -57.7% difference. The relative divergence of 15.2% indicates that this underperformance is relatively low compared to the historical range of underperformance.

The Alpha and Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market. While periods of outperformance (positive alpha) exist, substantial periods of underperformance (negative alpha) are also present.  The consistently high Beta (above 2.5) suggests ENS is significantly more volatile than the overall market.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 12.0% | 14.4% | -6.0% | 2.5 |

| 2018-2020  | 18.0% | 48.7% | -16.0% | 3.1 |
| 2019-2021  | -9.0% | 18.7% | -82.0% | 3.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -1.0% | 56.2% | -12.0% | 2.8 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock price shows a recent downward trend. The price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, and significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price decrease of $0.44 (from $92.48 to $92.04) is relatively small and does not indicate a sharp drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI of 40.64 suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a short-term bounce.  However, the negative PPO (-0.60) and negative relative divergence (-0.5) suggest continued bearish momentum. The MRI of 0.44 indicates a medium risk level.  The projected long-term (2+ years) expected return is significantly negative (-186.1%) compared to the S&P 500, largely reflecting the historical underperformance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

EPS and revenue have shown a consistent upward trend over the past few quarters.  However, the October 2024 data appears duplicated.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |

| 2024-07-25 | 1.26 | 1.04 B$ |
| 2024-05-01 | 1.22 | 1.01 B$ |
| 2023-10-25 | 1.14 | 0.94 B$ |
| 2024-10-24 | 1.14 | 0.94 B$ | *(Duplicate Data - needs clarification)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable, but profit margins show some fluctuation.  ROE is generally low, indicating a relatively low return on equity.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) shows a mixed picture. While recent earnings demonstrate growth, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period and displays high volatility. Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook, as indicated by the projected negative return compared to the S&P 500, remains uncertain. The high beta and inconsistent alpha highlight the significant market risk associated with this stock.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data and a deeper dive into the drivers of the consistently high beta are recommended before making any investment decisions.  The -186.1% long-term expected return, while alarming, must be considered in light of the potential for market fluctuations and unexpected changes in the company’s performance.
