This report analyzes EnerSys (ENS), a global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

EnerSys' cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500.  

* **ENS Cumulative Return:** 12.81%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 66.36%
* **Return Difference:** -53.55%
* **Relative Divergence:** 26.1% (This indicates ENS's underperformance relative to VOO is in the 26th percentile of its historical range of under/outperformance.)

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows high beta values (generally above 2.9), suggesting ENS's price is highly sensitive to market movements.

The recent positive alpha (2.4 in 2023-2025) is promising, but needs more data for confirmation.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 13.0% | 13.4% | -16.0% | 2.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 28.0% | 62.8% | 10.0% | 2.9 |
| 2017-2019  | -22.0% | 62.8% | -51.0% | 2.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 7.0% | 62.8% | -19.0% | 3.1 |
| 2019-2021  | -24.0% | 59.4% | -78.0% | 3.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -9.0% | 73.5% | -15.0% | 2.9 |
| 2021-2023  | 7.0% | 73.5% | -9.0% | 3.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 25.0% | 73.5% | 8.0% | 3.6 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $82.52
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $81.83
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $90.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $96.14

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The recent price increase (from $81.03) is a minor positive, but the stock remains below its recent averages.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 28.69 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.16 (Negative momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.5% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -134.1% (This suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), assuming current trends continue.  This needs further investigation to be considered reliable.)

The low RSI suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. However, the negative PPO and high MRI indicate bearish momentum and considerable risk.  The recent price increase of $1.84 is noteworthy but not sufficient to alter the overall bearish signal.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 1.38 | $1.08B        |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.26 | $1.04B        |
| 2024-05-01 | 1.22 | $1.01B        |
| 2023-10-25 | 1.14 | $0.94B        |
| 2024-10-24 | 1.14 | $0.94B        | *(There seems to be a duplicate entry here.)*


Earnings are showing a gradual increase in both EPS and revenue.  However, further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this trend. Note the duplicate entry needs clarification.

**5) Financial Information:**

Profit margins are relatively stable, though they show some fluctuation. Revenue appears to be relatively consistent.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) currently shows a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While recent earnings show positive growth and the RSI suggests an oversold condition, other indicators like the negative PPO, high MRI, and significantly negative projected long-term return suggest caution. The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  Further investigation is needed to determine if the recent positive earnings trends are sustainable and whether the current low price represents a genuine buying opportunity or a continuation of the downtrend.  The provided -134.1% expected return requires further scrutiny and validation.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk associated with this stock before making any investment decisions.
