Over the analyzed period, ENS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 16.26% compared to VOO's 76.18%.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and a relatively consistent beta of around 2.9-3.0.  This high beta suggests ENS is highly sensitive to market movements.  The inconsistent alpha indicates the stock's performance is not consistently outperforming or underperforming the market, but rather depends on the specific market conditions within the specified time frame.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 15.0% | 13.4% | -18.0% | 2.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 29.0% | 62.7% | 8.0% | 2.9 |
| 2017-2019  | -21.0% | 62.7% | -55.0% | 2.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 8.0% | 62.7% | -22.0% | 3.1 |
| 2019-2021  | -23.0% | 59.4% | -0.9 | 3.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -9.0% | 73.6% | -1.1 | 2.9 |
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 73.6% | -0.6 | 3.9 |
| 2022-2024  | 26.0% | 73.6% | -0.2 | 3.6 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $82.64
* **5-day Moving Average:** $82.71
* **20-day Moving Average:** $87.89
* **60-day Moving Average:** $95.12

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price increase of $0.63 compared to the previous close (82.12 to 82.64) may be a temporary fluctuation, given its position relative to its moving averages.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk) - Indicates a moderate level of market risk.
* **RSI:** 34.95 (Oversold) - Suggests the stock may be oversold, potentially indicating a bounce, but doesn't guarantee it.
* **PPO:** -0.24 (Bearish) - Shows negative momentum and weakening trend.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.0 (Short-term upward movement) -  This indicates slight short-term upward momentum despite the overall downtrend.
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -157.3% - This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While recent earnings show growth, the stock's high beta, negative long-term expected return (-157.3%), and negative PPO suggest a bearish outlook.  Technical indicators like RSI suggest oversold conditions, potentially implying a short-term bounce. However, the long-term prospects, based on the provided data, appear weak compared to the broader market.  A thorough fundamental analysis, considering factors beyond the provided data, is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high beta indicates significant risk, and the substantial underperformance against the market requires careful consideration.
