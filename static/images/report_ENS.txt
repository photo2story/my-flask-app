**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) is a global manufacturer and distributor of industrial batteries and energy systems.  ENS significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the measured period, with a cumulative return of 27.32% compared to VOO's 87.98%. The -60.7% difference places ENS in the lower 25% of historical performance relative to the VOO.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others exhibit negative alpha and high beta (volatility).  The high beta consistently suggests ENS is significantly more sensitive to market movements than the overall market.  Capitalization (Cap) shows some growth throughout the period.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 15.0% | 13.4% | -18.0% | 0.1 | 2.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 29.0% | 62.7% | 8.0% | 2.9 |
| 2017-2019  | -21.0% | 62.7% | -55.0% | 1.8 | 2.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 8.0% | 62.7% | -22.0% | 0.0 | 3.2 |
| 2019-2021  | -23.0% | 59.4% | -0.9 | 3.0 |
| 2020-2022  | -9.0% | 73.6% | -1.1 | 2.9 |
| 2021-2023  | 8.0% | 73.6% | -0.6 | 4.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 26.0% | 73.6% | -0.2 | 3.6 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock price closed at $92.76, slightly below the last market price of $93.11.  The recent price action shows some upward momentum:

* **5-day MA:** $90.87
* **20-day MA:** $85.696
* **60-day MA:** $92.7042

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  It's very close to the 60-day MA, indicating a potential consolidation phase.  The small increase from the previous close ($0.38) doesn't signal a significant price jump.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.37 (Low Risk) suggests relatively low market volatility.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 77.71 (Overbought), indicating potential for a price correction.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 1.46 (Positive), confirms upward momentum, but needs to be considered together with the overbought RSI.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +4.1 (Short-term upward trend).
* **Expected Return:** -162.7% This extremely negative expected return needs clarification. It's likely an error or reflects a highly pessimistic scenario and is not consistent with other data.  Long-term (2+ years) investment needs to consider the potential for this stock to outperform the S&P 500. The historical underperformance and high beta make such a prediction highly uncertain.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The EPS and revenue show a generally upward trend, though there's some fluctuation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

EnerSys (ENS) presents a mixed picture.  While recent earnings show growth and the current price shows some short-term upward momentum, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the longer term, exhibiting high beta and inconsistent alpha.  The overbought RSI suggests caution, warning of potential price correction.  The extremely negative expected return should be investigated further for accuracy. A long-term investment strategy would require careful consideration of the high volatility and historical underperformance relative to the broader market.  Further investigation into the reason for the dramatically low expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.
