## EnerSys (ENS) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes EnerSys (ENS), a leading global provider of stored energy solutions for industrial applications.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

EnerSys' cumulative return of 31.7% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 89.4%. The difference is -57.7%, placing it at the 15.2nd percentile of its historical range (-73.2% to 29.1%).  This indicates underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta consistently above 2, indicating higher volatility than the market).  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others show significant negative alpha.  The high beta suggests that ENS is sensitive to market fluctuations. The large swings in MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlight the significant risk associated with this investment. Noteworthy is the exceptionally high alpha of 2.0 in 2023-2025, which requires further investigation to determine its reliability.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

EnerSys (ENS) exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, and its high beta indicates substantial market sensitivity and risk. While recent earnings show growth, the negative expected return (-186.1%) needs further clarification. The inconsistent alpha and high maximum drawdown across different periods raise concerns about its long-term prospects.  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the reasons behind the extremely negative expected return and the reliability of the provided data is crucial. The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum in the short term.  A long-term investment strategy should consider the high risk and volatility associated with ENS.  Considering the -57.7% divergence from the S&P 500, a long-term investment strategy should involve careful risk management.
