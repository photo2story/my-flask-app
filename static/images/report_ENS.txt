**Analysis:**

*   **Beta:** A Beta around 1.0 in earlier periods indicates that the stock moved in line with the market. However, the Beta decreasing to near 0 or even negative values in recent years (2021-2025) suggests a decoupling from the market trends, indicating that the stock has become less sensitive to overall market movements.
*   **Cap (B):** The market capitalization generally increased over the years, from $2.6B to $3.9B, reflecting some growth in the company's size and value.

*   **Expected Return (%):** -333.7%

**Analysis:**

*   The Low Risk MRI suggests that the overall market risk is currently low.
*   The RSI of 62.77 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), which could indicate a potential pullback.

*   The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a "Buy" recommendation with a high allocation (90% of cash), but with a small position size (2 shares).
*   The positive change in the 20-day relative spread suggests improving short-term performance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Important:** The extremely negative Expected Return (-333.7%) is highly unusual and warrants further investigation. It suggests a very pessimistic long-term outlook for the stock relative to the S&P 500.
