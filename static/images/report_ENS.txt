**Analysis:**

*   **Underperformance:** ENS has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period represented by the cumulative returns. The large negative deviation (-70.7) underscores this.
*   **Relative Deviation Interpretation:** A relative deviation of 11.0 means the current underperformance is near the lowest end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  This *could* suggest a potential for reversion to the mean, but requires further investigation.
*   **Alpha/Beta Insights:**
    *   **Inconsistent Alpha:**  Alpha fluctuates significantly, indicating ENS's performance relative to the market is unstable. Many periods show negative alpha, meaning underperformance *after* accounting for market risk.
    *   **Beta > 1:** Beta consistently exceeds 1, indicating ENS is more volatile than the S&P 500.  This means it tends to amplify market movements. The recent beta values are of particular concern.
