This report analyzes EnerSys (ENS), a global leader in stored energy solutions for industrial applications.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

EnerSys' cumulative return of 16.10% significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 76.08%.  The resulting divergence is -60.0%, placing it at the 25.5th percentile of its historical range (max: 29.9%, min: -90.8%).  This indicates a substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta consistently around 2.9-3.0, indicating higher volatility than the market).  Positive Alphas are infrequent, suggesting periods of outperformance are sporadic.  High maximum drawdown (MDD) values highlight significant risk. The recent positive CAGR suggests potential recovery but needs further evaluation.

**6. Overall Summary:**

EnerSys (ENS) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While recent earnings show growth, the stock price is currently in a downtrend, indicated by its position below its moving averages.  The relatively high beta suggests high volatility.  Technical indicators show mixed signals, with RSI suggesting oversold conditions. The extremely negative expected return needs immediate clarification. Before making any investment decisions, further investigation into the reasons behind the negative expected return and the duplicated earnings data is crucial, as well as a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and industry outlook.  The high beta makes this a riskier investment, and the historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500 should be carefully considered.
