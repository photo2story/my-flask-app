**5. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

ONDO-USD (Ondo) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  Its high MDD and negative Alpha underscore its risk and relative weakness. Recent price action suggests a slight positive movement, but the stock remains below key moving averages. The MRI is high, but negative Alpha and Beta should also be considered. The "Hybrid Signal" recommends buying 100%, but the expected return of 8219.4% should be treated with skepticism. It's crucial to assess the underlying assumptions driving this projection.

The news items are unrelated. Without analyst opinions or specific catalysts, it's difficult to make a strong case for immediate investment despite the "Buy" signal. Further research into Ondo's fundamentals, industry outlook, and the specific methodology behind the hybrid signal is warranted before making any investment decisions.
