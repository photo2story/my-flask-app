    *Interpretation:* Ondo has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The large negative return difference (-61.16%) indicates substantial underperformance. The relative deviation of 0.2 suggests Ondo is near the lowest end of its historical underperformance range compared to the S&P 500.

    *Interpretation:* The negative Alpha (-59.0%) further confirms underperformance relative to the market. A Beta of -0.1 suggests the stock has a very low correlation to the overall market. The high MDD (82.6%) indicates significant volatility and potential for large losses.  The negative CAGR of -15.0% is not a good sign.

*   **20-day Relative Deviation Change:** -3.1 (Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** 8239.9%

    *Interpretation:*  The MRI is at 0.9 which recommends high investment. The RSI value of 33.61 suggests the stock is oversold and could be due for a bounce, but it could also mean it will go further down. The negative PPO reinforces the downtrend. The 20-day relative deviation change indicates a recent decrease in relative performance.The expected return of 8239.9% is surprisingly high and should be treated with skepticism. This could be model-specific and might not reflect realistic future performance, if you invest for a long term (more than 2 years).
