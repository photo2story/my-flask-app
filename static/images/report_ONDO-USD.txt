### 8️⃣ Summary & Take‑aways  
- **Performance**: Ondo is trailing the market by almost 100 % and sits near the bottom of its historical divergence range.  
- **Risk**: Very high beta (2.1) and large drawdowns (MDD 76 %).  
- **Momentum**: Mixed short‑term signals; short‑term momentum (PPO, 5‑day SMA) is positive, but longer‑term trend (60‑day SMA) is negative.  
- **Technical outlook**: Medium risk (MRI 0.70) but potential long‑term upside (Expected Return 3685 %).  
- **News impact**: Tokenization expansion on Solana and Binance may drive future demand, but current valuation is low.  
- **Recommendation**: **Cautious** – consider a small position if you are comfortable with high volatility and speculative tokenized assets, or hold off until further data clarifies upside potential.
