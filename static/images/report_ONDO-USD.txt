    *   **Range:** Max: 236.5, Min: -76.2
    *   **Relative Deviation (% of Range):** 0.0%

**Analysis:** ONDO has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The large negative deviation indicates substantial underperformance relative to the benchmark.

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The negative Compound Annual Growth Rate (-31.0%) confirms the poor historical performance.
*   **MDD:** The high Maximum Drawdown (82.6%) indicates very high risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** The strongly negative Alpha (-74.0%) indicates significant underperformance relative to the market, even when accounting for market risk.
*   **Beta:** The slightly negative Beta (-0.1) suggests a very slight inverse correlation with the overall market.  It is important to note that the Beta is close to zero, indicating that the stock's movement is largely independent of the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization of 1.9 Billion.

*   **RSI:** 36.69 (Approaching Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.0754 (Bearish Momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1417 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 4.2% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-01)" - Recommends full investment based on the hybrid signal, but note the "Very Safe" label appears contradictory given the other data.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** 0.0 (Negative) - Indicates recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return (%):** 7994.6% (Projected Excess Return vs. S&P 500 for Long-Term Investment)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a "Medium Investment Recommended" level of risk, which seems optimistic given the underperformance.
*   The RSI is approaching the oversold territory (typically below 30), which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, but should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.
*   The negative PPO confirms the downward momentum.
*   The "Hybrid Signal" is highly aggressive, recommending full investment despite the risks. **This recommendation should be treated with extreme caution given the other indicators.**
*   The Expected Return is exceptionally high and should be viewed skeptically. Very high projected returns often come with very high risks.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Masimo vs. Apple Patent Infringement:** A jury verdict awarding Masimo $634 million could be relevant if ONDO is in a related industry or has similar patent concerns.
