2025-12-03 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Ondo (ONDO-USD) based on the data provided, broken down into the requested sections:

**1) Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Ondo is a company likely involved in tokenizing traditional assets like stocks and ETFs.
*   **ONDO-USD Cumulative Return:** -40.14%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 47.16%
*   **Divergence:** -89.6
*   **Relative Divergence:** 0.0

**Analysis:** ONDO-USD has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). The divergence of -89.6 indicates substantial underperformance.  A relative divergence of 0.0 suggests it is at the lowest point of the observed divergence range. This huge underperformance relative to the benchmark is a major red flag.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

*   **Period:** 2023-2025
*   **CAGR:** -40.0%
*   **MDD:** 82.6%
*   **Alpha:** -85.0%
*   **Beta:** -0.1
*   **Cap(B):** 1.6

**Analysis:**

*   **Negative CAGR:**  Confirms the poor performance over the period.
*   **High MDD:**  An 82.6% Maximum Drawdown indicates extreme volatility and potential risk.
*   **Negative Alpha:** A very large negative Alpha (-85.0%) indicates that the investment has underperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis. It shows the investment has generated significantly lower returns than expected, given its level of risk (Beta).
*   **Negative Beta:** A Beta of -0.1 suggests a weak negative correlation with the market. This means ONDO-USD *tends* to move slightly in the *opposite* direction of the S&P 500, but the relationship is not very strong.
*   **Cap(B):** The Cap(B) number is likely a figure related to the company's capitalization in billions of dollars, suggesting it is a mid- or large-cap company (the 1.6 figure is a little low for such a high-growth industry sector, though.)

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 0.5011
*   **Last Market Data:** Price = 0.5009, Previous Close = 0.5022, Change = -0.25%
*   **5-day SMA:** 0.4987
*   **20-day SMA:** 0.5159
*   **60-day SMA:** 0.6637

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is currently slightly below its previous close and hovering around $0.50.
*   The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, and the 20-day SMA is below the 60-day SMA.  This indicates a *downward trend* in the stock price over the short, medium, and longer terms. The price is moving further away from its moving average price over the longer term.

**3) Indicator Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 44.52 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.9808
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2151 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 4.0% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.3 (Negative – Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 7535.4%
*   **Expected excess return compared to S&P 500:** Assuming a long-term investment (over 2 years)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI Contradiction:** The MRI of 0.9 suggests a "High Investment Recommended," which is *highly contradictory* given the poor performance and high risk indicated by other metrics. This raises serious questions about the reliability or validity of the MRI.  It should be deeply scrutinized.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 44.52 is considered neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** The PPO is above zero, indicating that the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term moving average (confirming that the price is moving away from its longer-term average), which is generally considered a bullish signal.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 100% of cash" signal, described as "Very Safe," *directly contradicts* the high MDD, negative Alpha, and underperformance. Again, this raises significant concerns about the analysis generating this signal.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence indicates short-term downward pressure.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely high "Expected Return" (7535.4%) is *highly suspicious* and unrealistic.  It's likely based on a flawed model or calculation and should be viewed with extreme skepticism.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

The news headlines paint a picture of a company actively pursuing growth and partnerships in the tokenized asset space:

*   **Binance Wallet Integration:** Expanding access to tokenized stocks.
*   **Price Rally:**  Speculation about future price targets.
*   **European Expansion:** Bringing tokenized assets to regulated markets.
*   **Global Markets Launch:** Offering tokenized U.S. stocks on Ethereum.

**Analysis:** The news is largely positive, focusing on expansion, partnerships, and market interest. This could be driving some short-term price increases, but it does not seem to correlate to the price action that we are seeing.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Not provided.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis**

Overall, the data presents a mixed and concerning picture:

*   **Major Red Flags:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, a very high Maximum Drawdown, large negative Alpha, and contradictory signals from the MRI and Hybrid Signal. The extremely high expected return is also highly suspect.
*   **Negative Trend:** The stock is in a downtrend, with short-term, medium-term, and long-term moving averages indicating a decline.
*   **Positive News:** Recent news focuses on growth and expansion, which could be a positive long-term sign, but this has not been reflected in the price of the stock.
*   **Contradictory Signals:**  The MRI and Hybrid Signal are highly unreliable, given the context of the other data points.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available data, ONDO-USD appears to be a *very high-risk* investment. The significant underperformance, high volatility, and contradictory indicators raise serious concerns. While positive news regarding expansion exists, it's not enough to offset the substantial negative signals. Further investigation and due diligence are strongly recommended before considering any investment. The discrepancies in the data (especially the MRI and Hybrid Signal) need to be thoroughly investigated before relying on those indicators.
