This report analyzes BKNG's performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO), considering its recent price movements, technical indicators, earnings, and available financial data.  The analysis reveals a strong historical outperformance but suggests caution regarding short-term momentum.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

BKNG's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500.

* **BKNG Cumulative Return:** 119.85%

The provided alpha and beta analysis shows variable outperformance relative to the market (S&P 500) over different time periods.

This suggests considerable volatility in performance relative to market benchmarks.  The increasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) indicates company growth.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 19.0% | 16.5% | 2.0%  | 0.2 | 57.1 |
| 2016-2018  | 23.0% | 9.0%  | 17.0% | 0.2 | 56.6 |
| 2017-2019  | 8.0%  | 10.7% | -12.0%| 0.5 | 67.5 |
| 2018-2020  | 8.0%  | 26.8% | -26.0%| 0.0 | 73.2 |
| 2019-2021  | 24.0% | 26.8% | -49.0%| -0.1 | 78.8 |
| 2020-2022  | -1.0% | 57.9% | -12.0%| -0.2 | 66.2 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 4606.91
* **Last Market Price:** 4661.73
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 4707.20
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 4610.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 4774.59

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average but below both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent slight upward trend but still within a broader downward trend. The recent price increase of 1.19% from the previous close might be a minor bounce, not necessarily indicating a significant trend reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 62.74 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.45 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.2% (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -5.3% (Expected to underperform S&P 500 over the long term)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While PPO suggests upward momentum and RSI is not overbought, the negative relative divergence and negative expected return suggest caution. The recent slight price increase (1.19%) isn't significant enough to suggest a major upward trend reversal.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| 2025-02-20 | 41.55    | 35.82       | 5.73       |
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89    | 77.52       | 6.37       |
| 2024-08-01 | 41.90    | 38.37       | 3.53       |
| 2024-05-02 | 20.39    | 14.09       | 6.30       |
| 2024-02-22 | 32.00    | 29.48       | 2.52       |

This positive earnings surprise is a positive sign for the company's future prospects.


**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data is available.  A complete financial analysis cannot be performed without this crucial information.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong cumulative returns.  However, recent technical indicators suggest caution regarding short-term price movements.  The recent earnings show positive surprises which is encouraging.  The lack of revenue and gross profit data limits a more thorough financial analysis.  A long-term investment (2+ years) may offer potential upside, despite a projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-5.3% expected return).  Further investigation into the company's financials and industry trends is recommended before making any investment decisions.
