## Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) Investment Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency providing accommodation reservations, transportation, and other travel-related services.

BKNG's cumulative return is significantly higher than the S&P 500's (VOO).  The difference between BKNG's cumulative return (158.10%) and VOO's (37.39%) is 120.7 percentage points.  This places it at the 82.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided range.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently high alpha (significantly outperforming the market) and high beta (high volatility correlated to the market) across the periods analyzed.  The market capitalization is substantial and increasing.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $4796.10
* **Last Market Price:** $4870.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $4900.69
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $5060.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $4887.66

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The last market price of $4870.86 is slightly above the closing price, indicating a minor upward movement since the close.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 25.71 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.83 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -8.2% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 16% (above S&P 500)

The low RSI and negative PPO values, coupled with the negative relative divergence, reinforce the bearish short-term trend. However, the high expected return suggests potential long-term growth exceeding the S&P 500.  The relatively high last market price compared to the closing price hints at a potential short-term recovery or bounce, but further analysis is required to confirm this. A sharp rebound would be noteworthy, given the overall downward trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89     | 77.52         | Beat       |
| 2024-08-01 | 41.9      | 38.37         | Beat       |
| 2024-05-02 | 20.39     | 14.09         | Beat       |
| 2024-02-22 | 32        | 29.48         | Beat       |
| 2023-11-02 | 72.32     | 67.61         | Beat       |

**Analysis:** BKNG has consistently beaten earnings expectations in the last five quarters. While there's clear quarter-to-quarter fluctuation in EPS, the overall trend shows positive growth over the reported period.  More data would be needed to fully analyze revenue growth trends.


**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data is available, limiting a comprehensive financial analysis.  Additional data is necessary for a more robust assessment.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News:**  Information on recent earnings news within the past two days is missing from the provided data.
* **Market Outlook and Analyst Opinions:**  Missing from the provided data.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG demonstrates strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests a bearish short-term trend, supported by technical indicators.  The consistently positive earnings surprises are a positive factor.  The lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) and the absence of recent news and analyst sentiment limits a complete assessment. Further investigation into these missing areas is crucial before making any investment decision.  The high expected long-term return, despite current bearish sentiment, could make it attractive for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance.  However, the high beta suggests significant volatility should be expected.
