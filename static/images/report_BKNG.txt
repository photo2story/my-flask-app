## Booking Holdings Inc (BKNG) Investment Report

**1. Performance Overview and Comparison to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency providing booking services for accommodations, transportation, and other travel-related products.

Over the analyzed period, BKNG significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for BKNG was 162.59%, while the S&P 500 returned 116.43%. This represents a difference of 46.16 percentage points.  The relative divergence (85.5%) indicates that BKNG's performance is in the upper 85.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR of 163% from 2015-2025 further reinforces this strong outperformance.  However, a maximum drawdown (MDD) of 42% highlights the inherent risk in this stock.  A beta of 162 indicates significantly higher volatility than the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the reporting date:

* **Closing Price:** $4880.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $4798.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $4940.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $4936.96

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  However, the price is above the 5-day moving average, signaling some degree of short-term support.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (32.37):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.35):** Indicates a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change (-0.3):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (-5.6%):**  This indicates a projected negative return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This is counter-intuitive given the historical outperformance; further analysis of the methodology used to calculate this expected return is needed.  The current price of $4880.21 doesn't appear to reflect an extreme event (no mention of significant news suggesting a sudden price drop or surge).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters.  This suggests strong underlying financial health.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This crucial data is necessary for a thorough evaluation of the company's financial health and future prospects.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, the current technical indicators (RSI, PPO) and the negative long-term expected return warrant caution.  The lack of crucial financial data is a significant limitation.  The high beta suggests significant volatility, which needs to be considered in any investment decision.  Further investigation is needed to reconcile the strong historical performance with the projected negative future return and to obtain missing financial data.  A deeper dive into the companyâ€™s business model, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is necessary before making an informed investment decision.
