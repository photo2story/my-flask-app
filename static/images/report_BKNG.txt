## Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) Stock Analysis

**0. Executive Summary:**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG), an online travel agency, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period. While exhibiting high RSI and PPO values suggesting overbought conditions, strong recent earnings and a historically high relative strength against the market warrant further investigation.  Near-term price action shows a slight decline, but longer-term prospects appear positive, though considerable risk exists given high valuations and market volatility.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

BKNG's cumulative return (97.65%) considerably exceeded the S&P 500's return (87.98%), resulting in a positive divergence of 9.7%. This places BKNG in the 84.6th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500, based on the provided min/max range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance, with high Alpha values in recent periods (2021-2025) suggesting outperformance relative to the market, and lower values in prior years. This variability might reflect market conditions and BKNG's susceptibility to macroeconomic factors.  Market capitalization (Cap) shows a consistent upward trend.  The significant increase in CAGR and high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values show the high volatility of BKNG.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | EPS Beat/Miss |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-04-29 | 24.81 | 17.34 | +7.47 |

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This is a crucial gap in the provided data.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has exhibited strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations. However, current technical indicators (high RSI and PPO) suggest an overbought market, increasing the likelihood of a short-term correction.  The lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) limits a complete assessment of the company's financial health and future prospects.  While long-term prospects may be positive based on historical performance and recent earnings beats, investors should exercise caution due to the high valuation and potential for short-term volatility.  Further analysis using complete financial statements is strongly recommended before making investment decisions.
