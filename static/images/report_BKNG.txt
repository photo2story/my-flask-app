While EPS shows fluctuations from quarter to quarter, the overall trend shows positive growth and consistent exceeding of expectations.  Further analysis requires revenue and gross profit data.


**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, the absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  These key metrics are essential for evaluating the company's overall financial health and growth trajectory.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions within the last two days were provided.  To gain a complete picture, researching recent news articles and analyst reports is necessary.  The market outlook is equally crucial for a holistic assessment, and its absence limits the analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has shown strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Recent earnings demonstrate consistent beats, suggesting a healthy financial performance. However, the lack of crucial financial data (revenue, gross profit) and recent news prevents a fully comprehensive evaluation.  Technical indicators provide a mixed signal. The positive long-term expected return, coupled with the strong historical performance and consistent earnings beats (despite missing key data), makes a compelling case for further investigation.


**8. Recommendations:**

To make a more informed investment decision, it's crucial to obtain the missing financial data (revenue, gross profit) and review recent news releases and analyst reports on BKNG.  A complete financial statement analysis is highly recommended before making any investment decision.  The current data suggests a potentially strong long-term investment opportunity based on historical performance and consistent EPS beats, but further analysis is essential.
