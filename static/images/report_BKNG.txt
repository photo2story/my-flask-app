| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | Difference | % Beat |
|---|---|---|---|---|

**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  Further data is crucial for a complete assessment of BKNG's financial health and future prospects.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has shown strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, with recent earnings exceeding expectations.  Technical indicators suggest a short-term bullish trend. However, the absence of key financial data and a negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 warrant caution. A more comprehensive analysis requires access to complete financial statements and a deeper understanding of the company's long-term growth prospects. The 2 year expected return figure should be investigated to understand the reasons for this prediction.  It might reflect current market sentiment or an expected deceleration in growth.  Further research into the company's strategic initiatives and market conditions would provide a more robust analysis.
