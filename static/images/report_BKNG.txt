**Analysis of the table:**

*   **CAGR:** Wide range of annual growth rates, indicating volatility in performance. Recent years (2022-2025) show strong growth.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown values indicate significant risk and potential for large losses during downturns.

*   **Beta:** Fluctuating beta values suggest varying sensitivity to market movements. A beta of 1.6 in the 2023-2025 period indicates higher volatility than the market.
*   **Cap(B):**  Shows a general trend of increasing market capitalization.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** 5280.14
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 4952.31, Previous Close: 5080.86, Change: -2.53% (Significant drop in the last session)
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 5199.20
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 5384.69
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 5500.88

**Analysis:** The stock price has fallen below all three moving averages, which suggests a short-term downtrend. The significant drop in the last session (-2.53%) reinforces this bearish sentiment. The price is currently below the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, which is a bearish signal.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 34.60 (Approaching oversold territory, but not quite there)
*   **PPO:** -0.2967 (Negative, indicating a downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_1%_Buy 100% of cash (26 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** -9.8 (Negative, indicating a recent decline in relative performance)
*   **Expected Return:** -67.6% (Significant underperformance relative to S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon).

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, but the RSI, PPO, and negative change in relative deviation point to short-term weakness. The Hybrid Signal suggests a cautious approach, recommending a small allocation with available cash. The very negative expected return is a major concern. The last market data shows a sharp drop, indicating a potential acceleration of the downward trend.

    *   Innovation and adaptation within its brands (Priceline, Agoda, KAYAK).
    *   Medium MRI score.
*   **Negatives:**
    *   Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   Recent price drop and bearish technical indicators.
    *   Very negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500.
    *   High Maximum Drawdown values indicate significant risk.
    *   Lack of readily available revenue and profit data.
*   **Neutral:**
    *   Analyst reiteration of "Market Outperform" rating balanced by price action.
    *   High investor interest.

**Conclusion:**

While BKNG has demonstrated strong earnings and enjoys a positive analyst outlook, several concerning factors warrant caution. The underperformance relative to the S&P 500, bearish technical signals, and the significantly negative expected return suggest potential headwinds.  The recent price drop underscores the immediate concern. The lack of revenue and profit data further hinders a complete assessment.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals and negative trends, a cautious approach is advised. It might be prudent to wait for a stabilization of the stock price and a clearer indication of improved relative performance before considering a significant investment. Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative expected return and the lack of revenue data is strongly recommended.
