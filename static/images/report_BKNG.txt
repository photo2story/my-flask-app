**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, total revenue and gross profit data were not provided.  This significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  Further data is needed for a complete assessment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG exhibits strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The company demonstrates consistent earnings beats, suggesting robust financial health. However, the recent price decline and bearish short-term indicators warrant caution.  The lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) hinders a complete assessment.  The high beta indicates higher risk than the broader market.

**Investment Recommendation:**  For long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance, BKNG remains a potentially attractive investment, given its historical outperformance and consistent earnings beats.  However, investors should closely monitor short-term price movements and obtain comprehensive financial statements before making any investment decisions.  A complete financial statement analysis is crucial for a more informed decision.
