## Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) Investment Report

This report analyzes Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG), a leading online travel agency, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

BKNG's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference is 35.9%, placing it at the 77.3rd percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This suggests BKNG has historically outperformed the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $4774.33
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $4724.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $4801.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $4988.06

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The recent price change shows a small increase ($4774.33 vs $4721.86), but this increase is not substantial enough to indicate a significant reversal of the trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.41 (slightly below the neutral level of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.0166 (slightly negative, suggesting weak momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -0.4 (short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -6.6% over the long term (2+ years). This suggests that despite BKNG's past outperformance, its expected future return is currently below that of the S&P 500.  The recent price increase is not significant enough to change this outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss | % Difference |
|------------|----------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89    | 77.52        | Beat       | 8.2%         |
| 2024-08-01 | 41.90    | 38.37        | Beat       | 9.0%         |
| 2024-05-02 | 20.39    | 14.09        | Beat       | 44.7%        |
| 2024-02-22 | 32.00    | 29.48        | Beat       | 8.5%         |
| 2023-11-02 | 72.32    | 67.61        | Beat       | 7.1%         |

BKNG has consistently beaten earnings expectations in recent quarters, showing positive earnings momentum.  The significant beat in Q2 2024 is particularly noteworthy.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of total revenue and gross profit data significantly limits the financial analysis.  Without this crucial information, a thorough assessment of BKNG's financial health and growth prospects is impossible.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500. However, current indicators suggest a short-term downtrend. While recent earnings have been strong, exceeding expectations consistently, the lack of crucial financial data and a negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns.  The negative expected return, combined with the negative PPO and the price being below its moving averages, suggests caution. Further investigation into the financial data (revenue, gross profit, etc.) is essential for a more complete and accurate assessment. The relatively low RSI suggests it is not significantly overbought, but also not showing significant buying pressure.  Investors should carefully monitor the situation and look for clearer signs of recovery before making investment decisions.
