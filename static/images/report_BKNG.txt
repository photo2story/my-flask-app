**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency offering accommodation reservations, transportation bookings, and other travel-related services.

The cumulative return of BKNG (178.54%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (121.78%). The difference is 56.8%, placing it at the 93.7th percentile of historical divergence based on the provided data (max: 64.8%, min: -61.7%).  This suggests BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500 by a considerable margin over the observed period.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistent positive alpha (0.1) across all periods, indicating consistent outperformance relative to the market. Beta is consistently around 0.1, suggesting low correlation with overall market movements. However, the low beta values are suspect given the context of the high returns and warrant additional investigation.  Market capitalization has steadily increased over the years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 5152.13
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 5225.4
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 5179.18
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 4698.36

The price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it sits significantly above its 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term upward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 53.71 – Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.63 – Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -0.5 – Short-term downward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 8.4% –  This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment.  Given the high historical outperformance, this figure should be viewed with caution. The actual future returns are very uncertain.

The current price of 5152.13, while below recent moving averages, does not suggest a dramatic price drop.

BKNG has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in the last five quarters.  There is an apparent seasonal pattern, where EPS is higher in the last two quarters of the year compared to the first two.

**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data is available.  A more complete financial statement is needed for a thorough analysis.  The lack of this key data significantly limits the analysis.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

Information on recent earnings news (within the last 2 days), market outlook, and analyst opinions is missing and is crucial for a complete assessment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  Recent earnings reports show consistent beats of expectations.  However, the analysis is hampered by the lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) and current market information.  The consistently high returns and low beta values presented require further investigation. The short-term price action suggests a potential consolidation, but the long-term trend appears positive.  A more comprehensive analysis is needed incorporating complete financial statements, recent news, and analyst sentiment before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The 8.4% expected excess return should be viewed as highly uncertain given the limitations of the available data.
