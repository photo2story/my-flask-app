## Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency providing accommodation reservations, transportation tickets, and other travel-related services.

The cumulative return of BKNG (191.63%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (130.06%).  The difference is 61.6%, placing it in the 97.1st percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This indicates BKNG has substantially outperformed the market over the measured period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 5201.98
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 5185.17
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 5023.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 4464.88

The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates recent price stability.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 66.68 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.17 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** NaN (-) (Indicates a recent short-term downturn.)
* **Expected Return:** 5.7% (long-term, relative to S&P 500)

The discrepancy between a relatively high RSI and a negative PPO suggests some potential divergence in the short-term price movements. The significant difference between the closing price (5201.98) and the last market price (5219.81)  doesn't show a significant *immediate* price drop (only a minor 1.7% decrease). It is too small to indicate a sharp downward movement, or sharp upward movement after the earning call. However, the negative PPO and the negative 20-day relative divergence suggest caution for short term investment.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent EPS beats over the last five quarters:

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|----------|---------------|------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89    | 77.52         | +6.37       |
| 2024-08-01 | 41.90    | 38.37         | +3.53       |
| 2024-05-02 | 20.39    | 14.09         | +6.30       |
| 2024-02-22 | 32.00    | 29.48         | +2.52       |
| 2023-11-02 | 72.32    | 67.61         | +4.71       |

EPS shows a growth trend, although it fluctuates across quarters.  Consistent positive surprises relative to expectations suggest strong operational performance.  Further analysis with revenue data would provide a more complete picture.

**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, the provided data lacks crucial financial information like total revenue and gross profit, preventing a comprehensive financial analysis.  The EPS data alone is insufficient to fully assess BKNG's financial health.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  A more detailed analysis requires access to recent news sources and financial reporting platforms.  Market outlook is also lacking.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period, demonstrating strong relative strength.  Recent earnings consistently beat expectations, showcasing positive operational performance. However, the absence of vital financial data (revenue, gross profit) limits a thorough financial assessment.  Technical indicators present a mixed signal with positive RSI and a negative PPO.  A comprehensive analysis requires access to more recent financial data, news, and analyst opinions. The lack of specific information regarding recent earnings news and market outlook hinders a complete evaluation.  The provided data suggests a strong long-term outlook (supported by the 5.7% expected return), but short-term risks should be considered, given the mixed signals from the technical indicators.


**8. Recommendation:**

Given the limited data, a definitive buy/sell recommendation is not possible.  Further research is crucial to assess risk and return adequately.  Access to more recent financial statements, news articles, and analyst reports would improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of this analysis.
