Booking Holdings Inc. is a leading online travel agency.  Its cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500, with a difference of 28.93%. The high relative divergence suggests this outperformance is relatively extreme compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

Noticeably, recent years (2021-2024) show exceptionally high CAGR and positive Alpha, indicating significant outperformance against the market. However, the high MDD in some periods highlights the volatility inherent in the stock.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  Further data is needed for a robust assessment of BKNG's financial health.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical returns significantly exceeding the S&P 500. Recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations. However, current technical indicators (RSI, PPO, MRI) suggest a high-risk, bearish short-term outlook.  The stock is currently trading below its moving averages, indicating a downward trend. The absence of key financial data prevents a complete assessment.  The projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 warrants caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and a more complete set of financial data are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high relative divergence should be considered with caution, as it highlights extreme outperformance relative to historical patterns, which may not be sustainable.
