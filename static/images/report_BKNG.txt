**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 4763.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 4816.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 4998.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 4912.77

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 34.86 (Below 30 often indicates oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.79 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence:** -2.9 (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -5.9%  This suggests that over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years), BKNG may underperform the S&P 500 by approximately 5.9%.  This is counterintuitive to the cumulative return shown earlier, and warrants further investigation into the methodology used to calculate this number.  The discrepancy needs to be resolved.  Furthermore,  a -5.9% expected return does not automatically mean it's a bad investment â€“ it just means it's expected to underperform the S&P 500.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters.

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89   | 77.52        | +6.37      |
| 2024-08-01 | 41.90   | 38.37        | +3.53      |
| 2024-05-02 | 20.39   | 14.09        | +6.30      |
| 2024-02-22 | 32.00   | 29.48        | +2.52      |
| 2023-11-02 | 72.32   | 67.61        | +4.71      |

This positive earnings surprise trend is a strong positive sign.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of total revenue and gross profit data prevents a complete financial analysis.  This data is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of BKNG's financial health and growth prospects.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG shows a history of strong performance relative to the S&P 500, supported by consistently exceeding earnings expectations. However, the current price is below its moving averages and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook. The projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-5.9%) is a concern and requires further investigation into the methodology used to calculate this number.  The lack of key financial data limits a full assessment.  A more complete financial analysis with revenue and gross profit data, alongside a review of the methodology of the expected return calculation is necessary before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The short-term outlook appears bearish, while the long-term outlook is uncertain pending further analysis.
