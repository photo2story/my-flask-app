## Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) Stock Analysis

**0. Summary Statistics:**

BKNG's cumulative return significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While showing some recent positive momentum, indicators suggest a potential for near-term volatility.  Long-term outlook remains positive, though subject to market conditions.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency.

* **Cumulative Return:** BKNG (77.25%) slightly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (76.31%) resulting in a current divergence of 0.9%. The relative divergence of 75.7% suggests that this outperformance is relatively high compared to the historical range of divergence between the two.

* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows a fluctuating alpha, indicating periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (beta).  The high alpha values in recent years (2021-2024) suggest significant outperformance, driven by strong growth.  However, note that these are backward-looking CAGR figures and future performance isn't guaranteed.  The increasing beta also shows increasing market sensitivity in recent years. The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) is notable.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $4598.08
* **Last Market Change:** +3.62 (vs. previous close) - indicating a recent upward trend.
* **5-day Moving Average:** $4552.46
* **20-day Moving Average:** $4553.55
* **60-day Moving Average:** $4699.30

The price is currently below the 60-day moving average, suggesting potential for further upward movement, although the recent positive momentum (3.62% change) might imply a short-term price overshoot.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Low to Medium Risk) - suggesting relatively low risk, but it's crucial to note that this is just one indicator.
* **RSI:** 47.39 - Slightly below neutral level; not strongly oversold or overbought.
* **PPO:** 0.35 - A positive value shows the 12-day exponential moving average exceeding the 26-day exponential moving average (bullish signal).
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +3.6% (Short-term uptrend) - reinforces the recent upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -16.5% - This suggests that, while BKNG has outperformed in the past, the model predicts a negative alpha (underperformance) relative to the S&P 500 over a longer timeframe.

The 3.62% increase in the last market day suggests a recent positive movement that could be considered a short-term upward price jump.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.  The significant positive difference between actual and expected EPS is noteworthy.  This suggests a strong performance.


| 날짜 | EPS       | 예상 EPS | Difference |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 2025-02-20 | 41.55     | 35.82     | 5.73       |
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89     | 77.52     | 6.37       |
| 2024-08-01 | 41.9      | 38.37     | 3.53       |
| 2024-05-02 | 20.39     | 14.09     | 6.30       |

**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data is available. This significantly limits the financial analysis that can be performed.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 in recent years. Recent earnings have exceeded expectations. However, the long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500 (-16.5%).  The lack of revenue and gross profit data prevents a more comprehensive financial analysis.  The near-term outlook appears positive based on recent price movement and relative strength, but the lack of key financial data and the projected long-term underperformance warrant caution. A more in-depth analysis with complete financial data is necessary for a conclusive assessment.  Investors should consider diversifying their portfolio and carefully manage their risk.
