**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency offering accommodation reservations, transportation bookings, and other travel-related services.  The cumulative return for BKNG is 173.76%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 117.56%.  The difference is 56.2%, placing it at the 93.2nd percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This suggests a strong historical outperformance.  However, it's crucial to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.


**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** 5063.12
* **Last Market Price:** 5122.94
* **5-day Moving Average:** 5038.08
* **20-day Moving Average:** 5170.84
* **60-day Moving Average:** 4769.33

The current price is slightly below the 20-day moving average and significantly above the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential upward trend, but also vulnerability to short-term corrections.  The last market price of 5122.94 is near the 20-day MA, indicating a relatively stable recent price movement.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 41.74 (Below 50, suggesting the stock might be oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.96 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -0.5 (Slight weakening in relative strength)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** 9.2% over the long term (2+ years)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the negative PPO and decreasing relative strength indicate bearish momentum.  The expected return of 9.2% over the long term, exceeding that of the S&P 500, suggests potential for long-term growth, but this should be considered alongside the current bearish technical signals.  Given the last market price is very close to the 20-day MA, no significant 
sudden price action is observed.
