*   **Analyst Sentiment vs. Data:** The analyst consensus is "Buy" with a target price significantly above the current price. *However, this conflicts with the data suggesting significant underperformance.*

*   **Further Research Needed:** A deeper investigation is warranted to understand the factors driving the expected underperformance.
*   **Re-evaluate Analyst Opinions:** Question the basis for the current "Buy" ratings from analysts, especially considering the data presented.
*   **Monitor Price Action:** Closely monitor the stock's price action and volume for further clues about its future direction. The data suggests that the company may have had a downturn in performance in 2024-2025, with metrics such as Alpha and CAGR reducing compared to the previous period.
