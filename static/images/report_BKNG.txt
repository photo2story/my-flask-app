**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $4540.84
* **Previous Close:** $4612.44
* **Change:** -$71.60 (-1.55%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $4558.26
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $4568.90
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $4708.71

The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price drop of -1.55% is relatively small, but combined with the moving averages and RSI, signals a potential bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.28 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** 0.38 (Positive, but relatively low)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.2 (Short-term upward movement, but this is contradicted by other indicators)
* **Expected Return:** -17.4% (This significant negative expected return is alarming and should be investigated further for its source and validity).

The RSI and the recent price action suggest a bearish trend despite the slightly positive PPO.  The large negative expected return warrants further scrutiny. The relatively low MRI indicates a moderate risk level.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings have consistently exceeded expectations, which is a positive sign.  However, a more detailed financial analysis is needed to assess the sustainability of this trend.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | EPS Surprise (%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-02-20 | 41.55 | 35.82 | 15.99% |
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89 | 77.52 | 8.21% |
| 2024-08-01 | 41.9 | 38.37 | 9.2% |
| 2024-05-02 | 20.39 | 14.09 | 44.67% |
| 2024-02-22 | 32 | 29.48 | 8.55% |


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits the depth of this analysis.  Key financial metrics are crucial for a complete assessment of BKNG's financial health and future prospects.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG's recent performance relative to the S&P 500 is slightly underwhelming, although not significantly alarming considering the historical context. Positive alpha in recent years indicates periods of market outperformance. However,  the current downward price trend, bearish technical indicators (RSI), and concerningly negative expected return suggest caution.  The lack of essential financial data prevents a conclusive assessment of the company's long-term prospects.  Further investigation into the source of the -17.4% expected return and obtaining crucial missing financial data (revenue, gross profit, etc.) are critical for a more thorough and reliable analysis.  Given the current indicators, a cautious approach is advisable until further information is available.
