## Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) based on the provided data.  Note that the analysis is limited by the provided data and may not be exhaustive.  Missing financial data (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) significantly restricts a complete financial picture.


**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Booking Holdings Inc. is a leading online travel agency offering accommodation reservations, transportation tickets, and other travel-related services.

The cumulative return of BKNG is 175.52%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.68%. The difference is 54.8%, placing it at the 92.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $5096.04
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $5062.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $5166.46
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $4801.32

The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend. However, it is above the 5-day moving average, indicating some recent price recovery. The relatively significant gap between the current price and the 20-day and 60-day moving averages warrants attention.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 39.56 (below 50, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.69 (negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +1.6 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -5.0% (relative to S&P 500)


The RSI and PPO indicators suggest bearish momentum, yet the positive relative divergence hints at a potential short-term upward trend.  The negative expected return over the long term compared to the S&P 500 is a significant consideration. The high current price of $5096.04 might indicate a recent price jump, warranting a closer examination of recent news and market events to assess if this reflects a rapid rebound or a peak.
