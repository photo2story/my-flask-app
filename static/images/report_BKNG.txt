**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits the financial analysis.  Key financial ratios and profitability metrics cannot be calculated without this crucial information.  Further investigation is required to obtain this missing data.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting periods of strong alpha. Recent earnings significantly exceeded expectations. However, the recent price drop and a negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term raise concerns.  The missing financial data prevents a complete assessment of the company's financial health and valuation.  Further analysis, including revenue and gross profit data, is critical for a more comprehensive and informed investment decision.  The significant daily price drop necessitates a closer look at any news or events that might have triggered the sell-off.
