**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

BKNG's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  While short-term indicators suggest a possible downturn, long-term prospects appear positive based on historical CAGR and recent earnings exceeding expectations.  Further analysis is needed to confirm this outlook and assess risk.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency providing reservation services for lodging, transportation, and other travel-related products.

* **BKNG Cumulative Return:** 149.04%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 108.62%

However, high beta in the recent period also suggests higher volatility.  Note that a high beta doesn't necessarily mean better performance; it just means higher sensitivity to market changes.

**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data was provided, limiting a complete financial analysis.  This information is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of BKNG's financial health and future prospects.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, supported by consistently exceeding earnings expectations.  However, current technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend.  The lack of revenue and gross profit data prevents a full assessment of the company's financial position.  While the long-term expected return is slightly negative relative to the S&P 500, the substantial historical alpha and recent earnings beats warrant further investigation.  A deeper dive into financial statements and industry analysis is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high beta should also be considered â€“ implying greater volatility than the market.
