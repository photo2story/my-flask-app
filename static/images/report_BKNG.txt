## Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency offering accommodation reservations, transportation tickets, and other travel-related services.  Over the period analyzed, BKNG's cumulative return (192.13%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (126.85%). The difference is 65.28%, placing it at the 100th percentile of the historical relative divergence range.  This indicates BKNG's performance has consistently exceeded that of the S&P 500 within the observed period.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows that BKNG consistently exhibited a beta greater than 1, indicating higher volatility than the market.  However, the alpha values generally remain positive, suggesting that BKNG generated excess returns compared to the market benchmark over the analyzed periods. This is consistent with the significant outperformance observed in the cumulative return comparison. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows significant growth throughout the years.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 5210.92
* **5-day Moving Average:** 5039.46
* **20-day Moving Average:** 4840.65
* **60-day Moving Average:** 4351.96

The stock price is currently trading above all three moving averages, suggesting upward momentum.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates recent strong upward price movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.86 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential for a pullback)
* **PPO:** -0.06 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum, but very close to 0)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** 12.33 (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 0.27% (This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 for a long-term (2+ years) investment strategy).

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought, increasing the likelihood of a short-term correction. However, the positive 20-day relative divergence change and the price above its moving averages counter this indication. The very slightly negative PPO value is not a strong bearish signal. The expected return is modest.  The fact that the last market price (5209.2) is very close to the closing price suggests no significant sudden price movements.


**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows that BKNG consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.  For the most recent quarter (2024-10-30), reported EPS (83.89) exceeded expectations (77.52), suggesting positive performance.  Continued EPS beat suggests strong financial health.  However, a deeper dive into the revenue and gross profit data is needed for a comprehensive financial analysis (see point 6).


**5.  Missing Financial Data:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a complete financial analysis. This information is crucial for evaluating the company's overall financial health and profitability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires accessing real-time news sources.  I cannot directly access and process live data.  Please refer to reputable financial news outlets such as Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, or the company's investor relations page for the latest news, analyst opinions, and market outlook.)*  Look for recent earnings announcements, analyst ratings, and any significant news impacting BKNG's share price within the last two days.  Look for information on the impact of travel trends, economic conditions, and competition on BKNG's performance.


**7.  Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent earnings exceeded expectations, and the stock price shows upward momentum. However, technical indicators suggest potential short-term overbought conditions.  The absence of key financial data (revenue and gross profit) limits a full assessment.  A comprehensive review of recent news and analyst opinions, considering the high RSI value and limited provided financial data, is necessary to form a final investment opinion.  The long-term expected return is modest but positive.
