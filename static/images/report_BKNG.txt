**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.

| 날짜       | EPS      | 예상 EPS    | Difference |
|------------|----------|------------|------------|

| 2024-02-22 | 32.00    | 29.48      | 2.52       |

The positive EPS surprises suggest strong financial health, but this needs to be considered alongside other factors.


**5. Financial Information:**

No Total Revenue or Gross Profit data is available. This is a significant limitation for a comprehensive financial analysis.  More data is needed for accurate assessment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong recent performance, outperforming the S&P 500 significantly in the recent period. However, several red flags exist. The high Market Risk Indicator suggests significant volatility.  The long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500.  While recent earnings have been positive, the lack of crucial financial data (revenue, gross profit) hinders a complete picture.  The price action suggests a recent pullback after a period of growth, with the price now trading below its 60-day moving average.  A more thorough analysis requires additional financial data to properly weigh the positive recent performance against the cautionary signals from the risk indicators and projected return.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions.
