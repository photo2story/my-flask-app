**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data is available. This significantly limits the depth of the financial analysis.  Further investigation into BKNG's financial statements is recommended.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downturn.  While the company has consistently beaten earnings expectations, the lack of revenue and gross profit data hinders a comprehensive financial assessment.  The projected long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative, suggesting that while past performance is strong, future returns may be less impressive compared to the benchmark.  A more detailed fundamental analysis is necessary to make a fully informed investment decision.  The high volatility (as shown by the MDD) should be considered.
