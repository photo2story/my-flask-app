* **60-Day Moving Average:** 4639.05

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates a recent consolidation or modest upward movement.

Considering the closing price (5291.98) is near the high end of the recent range and the RSI being overbought,  a short-term correction is possible, although the overall trend appears positive. The significant difference between the closing price and the 60-day moving average points toward a bullish medium-term to long-term trend.  The expected return of 7.4% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is optimistic.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistent EPS beats over the past five quarters.  All reported EPS figures exceeded expectations.  Notably, the increase in EPS from Q1 2024 to Q4 2024 is substantial (20.39 to 83.89), indicating strong growth.  Further analysis of revenue and other financial metrics is necessary for a complete picture.

**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, without "Total Revenue" or "Gross Profit" data, a comprehensive financial analysis is impossible. The provided EPS data alone doesn't give a complete view of the company's financial health. More financial information is required.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions which were not provided in the original prompt.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG shows strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, with consistently positive alpha.  Recent price action suggests a bullish trend, although the RSI indicates a potentially overbought condition, suggesting a potential near-term correction. Strong EPS beats in recent quarters further strengthen the positive outlook.  However, a lack of crucial financial information (revenue, gross profit) limits the completeness of this analysis. Further research is needed into recent news, analyst opinions, and a more complete financial statement to provide a more comprehensive investment recommendation.  The long-term expected return of 7.4% over S&P 500 is promising but needs to be validated with more data.
