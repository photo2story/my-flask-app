**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  However, recent price action shows a short-term bearish trend, indicated by the price being below its moving averages and a negative PPO. While earnings have been strong, the lack of revenue and gross profit data prevents a complete assessment of the company's financial health. The negative expected return should be interpreted carefully, considering historical performance volatility.  Further investigation into the revenue and gross profit data is crucial for a complete analysis.  The relatively high beta values in some periods suggest considerable sensitivity to market fluctuations.
