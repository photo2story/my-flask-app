**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting strong cumulative returns.  Recent price action suggests a positive trend, supported by positive technical indicators (RSI).  Earnings consistently beat expectations, indicating a healthy financial outlook.  However, the lack of revenue and gross profit data is a crucial missing piece of the analysis.  Further investigation into recent news and analyst opinions is also needed to provide a complete picture.  The 0.3% expected long-term return, while positive, needs context from a more detailed analysis of the wider market outlook.

**8. Conclusion:**

BKNG shows strong historical performance and positive recent trends in earnings and price movement.  However, critical financial data is missing, and further research into recent market news and analyst assessments is necessary for a robust investment recommendation. The current analysis suggests a potentially positive outlook, but caution is advised until a more complete picture emerges.  Consider the absence of key financial data and seek professional financial advice before making any investment decisions.
