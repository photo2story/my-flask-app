BKNG has consistently beaten EPS expectations in the last five quarters.  While EPS fluctuates, the trend shows consistent positive surprises.  Further analysis requires revenue data to assess the sustainability of this EPS growth.

**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided.  This significantly limits the assessment of the company's financial health and the drivers of EPS growth.  A complete picture requires this crucial financial information.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No information on recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions was provided in the initial data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting significantly higher cumulative returns. However, recent price action suggests a downward trend, and the projected long-term relative return is negative.  Technical indicators show an oversold condition (RSI), but the negative PPO and recent relative strength suggest caution.  While EPS has consistently exceeded expectations, the lack of revenue and gross profit data prevents a complete financial assessment.  Additional information regarding recent news, analyst opinions, and overall market sentiment is needed for a more comprehensive evaluation.  The limited information hinders forming a definitive conclusion on whether BKNG is currently undervalued or overvalued.  The missing key financial data is a critical limitation.

**8. Recommendation:**

Given the incomplete data, a firm buy or sell recommendation cannot be made.  Further research is needed, focusing on obtaining missing financial data (revenue, gross profit), recent news and analyst reports, to form a more robust investment opinion.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500, despite strong historical outperformance and recent EPS beats, requires further investigation before any confident investment decision.
