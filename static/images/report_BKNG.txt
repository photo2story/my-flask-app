BKNG consistently exceeded expected EPS in recent quarters.  This is positive, but without revenue and profit margin data, it's difficult to assess the quality of earnings.


**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided. This is a significant limitation to a comprehensive analysis.  Key financial ratios and metrics cannot be calculated without this crucial information.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 over the specified period.  Recent earnings have exceeded expectations. However, the recent price drop and the lack of key financial data raise concerns.  The provided expected return of -4.2% suggests potential future underperformance relative to the S&P 500,  but this must be interpreted cautiously given the lack of substantial financial data and the recent strong outperformance.  Further investigation into revenue, gross profit, and other financial statements is crucial for a more complete and reliable assessment. The short-term outlook appears bearish, while the long-term outlook is less certain without more comprehensive data.
