## Booking Holdings Inc (BKNG) Investment Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Booking Holdings Inc (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency offering accommodation reservations, transportation tickets, and other travel-related services.

The cumulative return of BKNG (162.59%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (116.43%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 46.2%, placing it at the 85.5th percentile of historical divergence based on the provided data.  This indicates BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500 more often than not within the range of its historical performance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $4880.21
* **Last Market Price:** $4867.47
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $4798.42
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $4940.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $4936.96

The price is currently slightly below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend. The 5-day moving average is significantly lower, indicating recent price weakness.  The difference between the last market price and the closing price is minimal, suggesting stability in the closing hours of the market.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 32.37 (suggests the stock is in oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.35 (indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.3 (short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -5.6% (This suggests that even with a long-term investment horizon of 2+ years, BKNG's expected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is modest, and may even underperform)


The relatively low RSI and negative PPO values, combined with the negative short-term relative divergence, suggest bearish sentiment.  The provided expected return of -5.6% implies BKNG is not projected to significantly outperform the S&P 500 in the long term. The close proximity of the closing and last market price indicates no significant price shock post-close.

**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided.  This crucial information is essential for a comprehensive financial analysis and limits the depth of this report.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG exhibits strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, recent technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downturn. While earnings have consistently exceeded expectations,  the lack of key financial data like revenue and gross profit hinders a complete evaluation. The projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500, along with bearish technical signals, raises concerns about the current investment attractiveness. Further investigation into revenue, gross profit, and broader market conditions is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high historical volatility, reflected in the wide range of max and min relative divergence, should be considered.
