## Booking Holdings Inc (BKNG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Booking Holdings Inc (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency.  Over the period analyzed, BKNG has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO).  The cumulative return for BKNG is 155.09%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 112.20%.  This represents a difference of 42.9 percentage points.  The relative divergence (82.8%) indicates that BKNG's performance is in the top 82.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance compared to the market benchmark, but this needs further investigation with a broader data set.  The beta values generally remain low, which may suggest lower market volatility for the company. However, a definitive conclusion regarding risk assessment cannot be drawn without a more comprehensive analysis.  The significant increase in CAGR and large fluctuations in MDD (maximum drawdown) throughout the years warrant attention.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the last market close, BKNG's price was $4739.55.  The recent price action shows a bearish trend:

* **5-day moving average:** $4844.34 (higher than the closing price)
* **20-day moving average:** $5024.74 (higher than the closing price)
* **60-day moving average:** $4905.05 (higher than the closing price)

This indicates that the stock price is currently below its recent short-term and medium-term moving averages, suggesting potential downward pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (35.99):**  Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce back. However, this should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.

* **PPO (-0.82):** A negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.  The combination of a low RSI and negative PPO points towards a bearish sentiment.

* **Recent Relative Divergence (-6.8%):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend relative to the S&P 500.

* **Expected Return (-6.1%):**  The predicted return is negative. This could be due to the current bearish market sentiment, or a variety of other market factors.  The negative return is relative to the S&P 500, implying that, while the stock may still yield returns, the rate may be less than the index, which is not necessarily a bad thing, as an overall negative expected return can imply an appropriately priced and potentially safe stock.  Long-term (2+ years) investment with dollar-cost averaging could mitigate some risk.

* **Current Price Consideration:** The current price ($4739.55) is below the recent moving averages, supporting the conclusion that the stock is currently in a downward trend.  There is no evidence from the given data suggesting a sudden, drastic price movement (either up or down).

BKNG has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters. This is a positive signal for the company's financial health.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis. This crucial data is necessary for a complete assessment of BKNG's financial performance and its sustainability.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong cumulative returns. However, recent price action suggests a bearish trend, supported by technical indicators (negative PPO, relatively low RSI). While recent earnings have been positive, the lack of key financial data limits a thorough assessment.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 and downward trend should be carefully considered.  Further research, including a complete financial statement analysis, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Long-term investors might consider dollar-cost averaging into the stock given its strong historical performance and current oversold conditions but must weigh that against the recent bearish sentiment and negative expected returns.
