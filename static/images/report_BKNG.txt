* **Change:** -$0.65 (-0.14%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $4483.70
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $4564.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $4716.04

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  The recent slight decline indicates that the price is facing some downward pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.50 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** 0.21 (Positive, but relatively low)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -7.7% (Short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term, 2+ years):** -11.0% (This represents an expected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.)  This negative expectation should be carefully considered in relation to the other aspects of the analysis and long-term investment strategy.

The high MRI, coupled with the negative relative strength change, suggests increased risk. Although the RSI is approaching oversold levels, it's not definitively indicating a strong buy signal. The negative expected return is a significant concern for long-term investors. The recent price drop of -$0.65 isn't a dramatic event suggesting a sudden market correction.

**5. Financial Information:**

No financial data ("Total Revenue" or "Gross Profit") was provided.  A complete financial analysis cannot be conducted without this crucial information.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, with a consistently positive surprise in earnings. However, recent indicators (MRI, relative strength, and the negative long-term expected return) suggest elevated risk and potential for underperformance in the long term. The absence of crucial financial data significantly limits a comprehensive assessment.  While past performance is impressive, investors should carefully consider the current risk indicators, the negative long-term expected return, and the missing financial information before making investment decisions.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative long-term expected return is strongly advised.
