**7. Overall Summary**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) has generally outperformed the S&P 500, though the margin has recently narrowed. While historical Alpha/Beta analysis reveals varied performance, recent earnings have consistently exceeded expectations. However, technical indicators suggest a potential short-term downtrend, and the long-term expected return is negative compared to the S&P 500.

**Recommendation:**

Given the recent negative short-term signals and the lack of financial data, investors should exercise caution. While positive earnings provide some confidence, monitoring upcoming news, company announcements, and industry trends is crucial. The "Hybrid Signal" recommendation to increase cash holdings further supports a conservative approach. A deeper dive into the reasons behind the negative long-term return projection is warranted before making any investment decisions.
