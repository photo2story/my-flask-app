**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 in the past.  However, the provided long-term expected return suggests potential for underperformance in the future. The recent price action shows a slight dip, but moving averages suggest potential for upward movement.  Consistently strong earnings are positive, but the lack of comprehensive financial data limits the depth of the analysis.  Further investigation into the financial data, along with a deeper dive into the -4.5% long-term expected return prediction, is necessary for a more conclusive assessment.  The RSI nearing overbought territory suggests caution in the short-term.
