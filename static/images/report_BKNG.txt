**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data was provided, limiting a comprehensive financial analysis.  This is a crucial gap in the provided data.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has shown strong recent performance, outperforming the S&P 500 in both cumulative returns and recent earnings. Technical indicators suggest a short-term upward trend, but the long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500. The lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) significantly hinders a complete assessment.  The high alpha in recent years warrants further investigation into the associated risk factors.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough analysis incorporating missing financial data and a deeper dive into the drivers behind the high alpha values is strongly recommended.
