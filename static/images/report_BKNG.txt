**Analysis:** BKNG has consistently beaten EPS expectations in the last five quarters.  While EPS fluctuates between quarters,  the trend shows positive earnings growth.  Further analysis requires revenue and gross profit data to assess the sustainability of this growth.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of Total Revenue and Gross Profit data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  Without these key figures, it's impossible to assess the profitability and growth drivers of the company.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

The provided data lacks information on recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This crucial context is missing for a complete evaluation of BKNG's current situation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, indicated by the high cumulative return and relative divergence.  Recent earnings show consistent beats over expectations, highlighting strong financial performance. However, the lack of crucial financial data (revenue, gross profit) and recent market news severely limits the scope of this analysis.  The high RSI suggests potential near-term price correction.  The long-term outlook (assuming continued strong earnings) is positive, but a thorough risk assessment requires more comprehensive data.
