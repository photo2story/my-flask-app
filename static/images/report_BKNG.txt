**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided, limiting a complete financial analysis. This is a crucial gap in the provided data and necessitates obtaining this information from other sources for a thorough evaluation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires access to real-time news sources.  I cannot provide specific news within the last 48 hours without access to a live news feed. Please consult reputable financial news websites such as Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, or MarketWatch for the latest news and analyst opinions on BKNG.)*  Look for recent earnings calls transcripts, press releases, and analyst reports.  Pay attention to any commentary on future guidance, sector trends (travel industry outlook), and potential risks.  FINBOLD and other financial news sources are good starting points for analyst opinions and performance highlights.

**7. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently high alpha (above 1), indicating that BKNG has outperformed the market (as measured by the benchmark used for the alpha calculation), and a beta generally around 1.1-1.2 suggesting above-average market volatility. The consistently positive alpha and relatively high beta points to good performance with some associated risk. However, the time periods are short, making long term extrapolation from these alpha and beta values unreliable.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG exhibits strong historical performance, significantly outpacing the S&P 500.  Recent earnings have consistently exceeded expectations, further supporting this positive trend.  However, the RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, and the absence of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) limits a complete assessment.  The relatively high beta highlights the potential for increased volatility.  Thorough due diligence, including a review of recent news and financial statements, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Consult financial professionals for personalized advice.
