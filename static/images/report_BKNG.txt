**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $4818.14
* **5-day Moving Average:** $4783.11
* **20-day Moving Average:** $4885.68
* **60-day Moving Average:** $4964.81

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The recent price increase (Last-market data) shows a significant jump, but it's important to assess if this is a sustainable trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.09 (Below 50, suggesting the stock might be oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.27 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.5% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -6.7% (over a long-term, 2+ years, assuming current trends continue).  This suggests underperformance against S&P 500 given this estimate, which should be considered in the broader context of the analysis. The significant recent price increase may not be fully reflected in this expectation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters.

| Date       | EPS     | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |

**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data is available. This is a significant limitation for a comprehensive financial analysis.  More data is needed to accurately assess the company's financial health.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating strong growth and exceeding earnings expectations. However, recent price action and technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bearish trend.  The absence of crucial financial data prevents a complete assessment of the company's underlying financial strength.  The long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is currently negative.  Further investigation into the sustainability of recent earnings beats and a more detailed financial analysis are crucial before making an investment decision.  The significant recent price jump warrants monitoring for potential corrections.  Considering the lack of key financial data, a cautious approach is recommended.
