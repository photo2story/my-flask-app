    *Analysis:* The current price is below all moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The 60-day MA is significantly higher, indicating a more pronounced downward movement in recent weeks. The "Last Market: None" might indicate a data issue or a closed market session.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI:** 36.57 (Approaching oversold territory - potentially a buy signal)
*   **PPO:** 0.36 (Positive, but close to zero, indicating weakening momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_1%_Buy 100% of cash (26 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -2.1 (Negative indicates short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -105.2% (Significantly negative, suggesting underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the long term if holding from current level).

    *Analysis:* The RSI nearing oversold territory could present a buying opportunity. However, the negative expected return is a significant concern. It suggests that, based on current metrics, an investment at this point is projected to underperform the S&P 500 over a 2-year or longer timeframe.  The "Hybrid Signal" suggesting a small cash position and full buying indicates a moderately positive outlook from that specific model, despite the negative expected return.

**5) Overall Analysis & Recommendations:**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) is experiencing mixed signals. While recent news highlights strengths in revenue growth and strategic adaptation (digital nomads, AI), the technical indicators show a short-term downtrend.

The most concerning factor is the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, reflected in the negative "Expected Return" and the large negative difference in cumulative returns. The table with Alpha, Beta Analysis also shows a MDD over 70% across the board, which indicates that it is a volatile stock

However, the RSI approaching oversold levels, combined with the strong analyst consensus and high target prices, suggests a potential opportunity for investors who believe in the company's long-term growth prospects.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Cautious Observation:** Given the negative expected return and short-term downtrend, it is best to approach with caution.
*   **Monitor Key Metrics:** Keep a close watch on the stock's performance relative to the S&P 500 and any changes in analyst ratings.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** The analyst's view indicates positive signs for the company if you are investing long term.
*   **Possible Entry Point (Oversold):** If you believe in the long-term potential, the current oversold conditions (RSI) might present a possible entry point, but weigh your decision against the risks.
*   **Consider a small portfolio:** Hybrid Signal suggests to buy a little bit with cash as MRI suggests.
