## Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG), a leading online travel agency offering accommodation reservations, transportation tickets, and other travel-related services.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

BKNG's cumulative return is 71.46%, slightly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 72.42%.  The difference is -0.96%, placing it at the 73.8th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-74.0% to 24.9%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies considerably year-to-year, reflecting market volatility, the Beta generally hovers around 0.6, suggesting less volatility than the market (Beta of 1).  However, Alpha, representing outperformance relative to the market, is highly variable, ranging from -0.1 to 3.8.  The significantly high Alpha values in recent years (2021-2025) suggest substantial outperformance during these periods, potentially driven by post-pandemic travel recovery.  The high and variable MDD (Maximum Drawdown) highlights the risk involved in BKNG investments.  Market capitalization has steadily increased over the analyzed period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

BKNG's closing price is $4437.63, a decrease of $135.68 (-2.97%) from the previous close.  The stock is currently trading below its 5-day ($4544.21), 20-day ($4559.14), and 60-day ($4701.92) moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk).
* **RSI:** 44.70, suggesting the stock is approaching oversold territory.
* **PPO:** 0.24, a positive value indicating bullish momentum, but relatively weak.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 0.7 (+), short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -17.5%. This significant negative expected return raises concerns, particularly considering the recent price drop. The large negative change from the previous close (-2.97%) should be investigated further to understand the underlying causes.  This might be a significant short-term event needing further consideration.  Long-term (2+ years) potential return relative to the S&P 500 is not detailed enough for a thorough assessment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently exceeded earnings expectations (EPS) in recent quarters, indicating strong financial performance.  However, there is no trend that stands out from the data. More historical data may be needed to draw strong conclusions.

| 날짜       | EPS      | 예상 EPS   |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-02-20 | 41.55    | 35.82     |
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89    | 77.52     |

| 2024-05-02 | 20.39    | 14.09     |
| 2024-02-22 | 32       | 29.48     |



**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data is available, significantly limiting the financial analysis. This information is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of BKNG's financial health and growth prospects.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG's recent performance is mixed. While it has shown periods of significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500, reflected by high Alpha values in some years, the recent price drop and negative expected return are concerning.  The lack of crucial financial data (total revenue, gross profit) severely hampers a thorough analysis.  The relatively low RSI suggests potential for a short-term rebound, but the negative expected return warrants caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent price drop and the acquisition of missing financial data is essential before making any investment decisions. The high variability in Alpha and MDD underscores the significant risk involved in investing in BKNG.  A more in-depth analysis considering macroeconomic factors and industry trends is recommended.
