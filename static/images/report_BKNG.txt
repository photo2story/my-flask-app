* **60-Day Moving Average:** $4972.64

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating short-term upward momentum, but below the 60-day average, suggesting potential resistance at higher levels.  The recent small price increase (0.53%) doesn't show any significant upward or downward movement.

* **PPO:** 0.58 (Positive value indicates bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +7.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -5.4% (This implies a potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, despite past outperformance). This negative expected return should be considered cautiously in light of the previous strong outperformance; further investigation is warranted.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.  This suggests positive earnings momentum.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of total revenue and gross profit data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing information is a significant limitation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, with a strong cumulative return.  Recent earnings have been positive, exceeding expectations. However, the provided long-term expected return is negative, which contradicts the historical outperformance.  This discrepancy needs further investigation. The lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) significantly limits a full assessment.  Technical indicators suggest a slightly bullish short-term outlook, but the long-term outlook requires a more comprehensive analysis, including the missing financial data and a deeper dive into the factors contributing to the negative expected return.  The high volatility (indicated by Beta) should also be considered when making investment decisions.
