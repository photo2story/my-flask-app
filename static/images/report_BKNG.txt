*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown has been significant, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty or industry disruption.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha has fluctuated considerably.  The recent outperformance (2021-2025) is notable.
*   **Beta:** Beta varies. Periods with higher beta (e.g., 2017-2019, 2021-2023, 2022-2024) indicate BKNG's price movements were more sensitive to market changes. A positive beta suggests that the stock generally moves in the same direction as the S&P 500, with higher beta values indicating greater volatility compared to the index.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Last Market Data:** Price: $5717.1, Previous Close: $5718.51, Change: -0.02

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** $5560.43
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** $5307.36

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, but above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages.  This suggests a recent minor pullback within a broader upward trend. The minimal change from the previous close suggests price stability in the very short term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3294 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 74.11 (Overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 0.0081

*   **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.2 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -9.0% (Projected long-term underperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI indicates that the stock is currently overbought, which could signal a potential correction.
*   The low Market Risk Indicator is a positive sign for stability but contradicts the 'Caution' signal.
*   The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days suggests a recent weakening in BKNG's performance compared to VOO.
*   The negative expected return is a concerning signal, suggesting that, based on the model, long-term investment might not yield superior returns compared to the S&P 500.
*   The almost no change {'price': 5717.1, 'previousClose': 5718.51, 'change': -0.02} suggests a lack of significant volatility or immediate market reaction, even though earnings exceeded expectations.

**Analysis:** BKNG has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in the last five quarters. This strong earnings performance is a positive indicator of the company's financial health and operational efficiency.

**6. Financial Data**

No 'Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit' data available for BKNG.

**Analysis:** The absence of this key financial data limits the ability to assess the company's revenue generation and profitability trends.

**7. Overall Summary**

Booking Holdings (BKNG) has demonstrated strong cumulative return, outperforming the S&P 500, especially in recent years. The company has also consistently exceeded earnings expectations. However, the stock is currently in overbought territory and the negative expected return suggests potential underperformance vs. the S&P 500 in the long run. Recent news points to volatility and sensitivity to market events. The lack of revenue and gross profit data makes it difficult to conduct a comprehensive financial assessment.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, investors should exercise caution. The positive earnings and recent outperformance are encouraging, but the overbought condition, negative expected return, and lack of key financial data warrant a careful approach. Monitoring upcoming earnings reports, news releases, and industry trends is crucial.
