The cumulative return difference between BKNG (152.26%) and VOO (120.36%) as of the last data point is 31.9%.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistently positive alpha (0.1) across all periods, indicating BKNG has historically outperformed the market.  The beta of 0.1 suggests low correlation with the overall market, meaning its price movements are less affected by broad market fluctuations.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values show strong historical growth, particularly in the more recent periods (2021-2023 and 2022-2024). However, it's important to note the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values in some periods, suggesting significant risk.  The consistent market capitalization of $155B across all years indicates a large, established company.

**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data was provided, which limits a full financial analysis. This data is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong growth potential and positive alpha.  However, the recent price drop, coupled with negative technical indicators (RSI and PPO), suggests a short-term bearish trend. The consistent exceeding of earnings expectations is a positive sign.  The lack of revenue and gross profit data prevents a complete financial assessment.  The long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is negative, but this must be considered in light of the potential for short-term volatility and long-term growth prospects of a well-managed company in a rapidly evolving industry.  Further research, including analysis of revenue and profit margins, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high MDD values across several years highlight the inherent risk involved with this stock.
