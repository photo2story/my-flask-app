**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data was provided, hindering a comprehensive financial analysis.  This is a critical missing piece of information.


**6. Overall Summary:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, recent price action shows a short-term downtrend. While recent earnings have exceeded expectations, the lack of revenue and gross profit data limits a full assessment of the company's financial health. The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 warrants caution, though the long-term outlook depends heavily on broader economic conditions and the travel industry's recovery.  Further analysis incorporating revenue, gross profit, and a more thorough risk assessment is necessary for a complete investment decision. The high relative divergence in the past might be partially due to the company's market position and resilience in the pandemic recovery.  However, investors should proceed cautiously, carefully considering the market's current valuation of the stock relative to its growth prospects.
