**6. Overall Conclusion:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong long-term growth exceeding the S&P 500. However, recent price movements indicate a bearish trend.  While earnings have consistently beaten expectations, the lack of revenue and gross profit data limits a complete financial assessment. The negative expected return for the short term (-10.9%) combined with negative technical indicators currently suggests caution before investing. A deeper dive into financial statements and broader macroeconomic factors is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high maximum drawdown values across various periods highlight significant risk associated with this investment. Further investigation is required to ascertain the sustainability of the strong recent growth and the reasons behind the recent price drop.
