**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of Total Revenue and Gross Profit data prevents a thorough financial analysis.  This crucial information is needed to assess the company's financial health and sustainability of its performance.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in recent years.  The high CAGR, positive PPO, and consistent EPS beats support this observation. However, the overbought RSI and a projected negative long-term expected return (relative to the S&P 500) warrant caution.  The lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) limits a more comprehensive assessment.  Further investigation into the company's financials and a broader consideration of market conditions are necessary before making any investment decisions. The current high valuation, indicated by high relative divergence, suggests a potential risk of a short-term correction.  A long-term outlook should consider the inherent volatility of the travel industry and BKNG’s sensitivity to macroeconomic factors.
