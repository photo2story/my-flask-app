**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no Total Revenue or Gross Profit data is available for analysis. This significantly limits a comprehensive assessment of BKNG's financial health.  This missing data is a critical gap in the analysis.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has shown strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, evidenced by a high cumulative return and significantly positive relative divergence.  Recent earnings have consistently exceeded expectations. However, the current price is below its moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The significant fluctuations in Alpha and Beta values over time, coupled with a long-term expected return that underperforms the market (-5.5%), warrant caution.  Crucially, the lack of Total Revenue and Gross Profit data prevents a thorough financial assessment.  Further investigation into the -5.5% expected return, the reasons for the fluctuating Alpha and Beta, and securing the missing financial data are vital before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility (as indicated by the Beta and MDD) is a considerable risk factor to consider.
