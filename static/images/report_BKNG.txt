**Analysis:**

The missing revenue and gross profit data is a significant gap in the analysis. Without this information, a complete assessment of the company's financial health is challenging.

### 7. Summary & Recommendation

**Overall Assessment:**

Booking Holdings (BKNG) demonstrates strong financial performance with consistent EPS beats, significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500, and positive technical indicators. The expected return is also attractive for long-term investors. The low Market Risk Indicator is also a positive sign. However, recent news suggests potential volatility, and the high RSI indicates that the stock might be due for a short-term correction.

**Recommendation:**

Given the positive long-term outlook and strong historical performance, a **cautious buy** approach appears appropriate. The Hybrid Signal supports this stance, suggesting a reduced cash ratio to maximize exposure to potential gains while mitigating risk. Continuously monitoring news, earnings reports, and technical indicators is essential to adjust the investment strategy as needed. The absence of recent Total Revenue and Gross Profit data is a concern and should be addressed if possible.
