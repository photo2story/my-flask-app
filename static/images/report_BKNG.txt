**Analysis:**

*   BKNG has consistently beaten EPS estimates in the recent quarters, which is a positive sign for its financial performance.

**6. Financial Data:**

*   No 'Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit' data available.

**Analysis:**

*   The absence of revenue and gross profit data makes a comprehensive financial assessment difficult.

**7. Overall Conclusion:**

*   BKNG has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly. While recent earnings have been positive and analyst opinions are generally bullish, technical indicators suggest caution. The negative expected return is a major concern.
*   The price increase today is a positive sign, but needs to be viewed in the context of the overall downtrend.
*   The lack of revenue and gross profit data is a significant limitation.

**Recommendation:**

Given the mixed signals, a **neutral** to **cautiously optimistic** stance is warranted. While analyst ratings and recent earnings beats are encouraging, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative expected return, and downtrending moving averages raise concerns.

*   **Potential Investors:** Should conduct further due diligence, particularly focusing on revenue and profitability trends, and consider the risks associated with investing in a stock that has underperformed the market.
*   **Current Holders:** Should monitor the stock closely and consider setting stop-loss orders to protect against further downside risk. The positive EPS data and analyst ratings might warrant holding the stock, but the underperformance compared to the S&P 500 should not be ignored.
