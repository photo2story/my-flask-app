**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data is available, preventing a complete financial analysis.  Further data is needed for a comprehensive assessment of the company's financial health.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

The provided information lacks details on recent earnings news, market outlook, or analyst opinions.  This crucial information is missing for a comprehensive analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has shown a strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, the current technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest a bearish short-term momentum.  The recent price action is slightly bearish, with the price below its short-term moving averages. Despite consistently exceeding EPS expectations, the lack of revenue and gross profit data significantly limits a full financial analysis. The projected negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant consideration.  More information on recent news and analyst opinions is needed for a complete investment decision.


**8. Conclusion:**

While BKNG's past performance has been excellent, the current data presents a mixed picture.  A more complete analysis requires additional financial data (revenue, gross profit) and current market information (news, analyst reports).  The potential for long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 warrants careful consideration, particularly given the current bearish technical indicators.  Further research is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
