**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500. Recent earnings significantly exceeded expectations.  However, the high RSI and relatively low expected long-term return compared to prior performance suggest caution.  The lack of revenue and gross profit data prevents a comprehensive assessment of the company's financial health and growth potential. Further investigation into these key financial metrics is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current price might be nearing overbought territory based on the RSI, suggesting a potential short-term correction could occur.  Long-term investors, however, might still find BKNG attractive given its consistent earnings beats and historical strong performance.
