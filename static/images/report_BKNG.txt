**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data was provided, hindering a complete financial analysis. This is a significant limitation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but the currently high relative divergence (76.7%) suggests a potential correction or consolidation period might be in order. The recent price movement shows a slight downward trend below key moving averages. Positive earnings surprises are encouraging, but the lack of revenue and gross profit data prevents a thorough evaluation of the company's financial health. The negative long-term expected return (-6.6%) against the S&P 500 raises concerns.  Further analysis with complete financial data, including revenue and profit margins is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high recent alpha values suggest potentially significant risk in the recent outperformance.  Therefore, caution is advised before taking any investment actions.
