## Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG), a leading online travel agency, shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over a specific period. However, recent price action suggests a potential slowdown, warranting a cautious approach.  Further analysis of financial data is limited due to the unavailability of key metrics.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

BKNG's cumulative return of 72.24% significantly outperforms VOO's 56.30% return. The difference of 15.9% places it in the 87.4th percentile of its historical range of outperformance against the S&P 500 (based on provided data).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals variable performance against the market (Beta) and significant outperformance (Alpha) in certain periods, particularly recently (2021-2025).  However, Alpha fluctuates substantially, suggesting inconsistent outperformance relative to market risk.  The high Beta values in some periods indicate higher sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Capitalization (Cap) has shown a steady increase.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2015-2017  | 21.0% | 42.6% | -9.0% | 0.1 | 56.4 |
| 2016-2018  | 18.0% | 57.7% | 0.0% | 0.2 | 55.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 3.0% | 57.7% | 1.1% | 0.667 |

**2. Recent Price Action:**

The stock price is currently at $4296.57, below its 5-day ($4481.23), 20-day ($4549.99), and 60-day ($4742.07) moving averages. This suggests a downward trend.  The recent 1.22% increase might be a temporary bounce.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **MRI (0.4883):** Indicates a high-risk level.
* **RSI (41.10):** Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.
* **PPO (-0.5991):** Shows a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:** A positive change of 3.0 suggests short-term upward momentum, potentially contradicting the moving average trend.
* **Expected Return (-9.0%):**  This indicates an expected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  The 1.22% daily price increase needs to be considered in the context of this negative outlook. It may be a short-term fluctuation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.  This is a positive sign.

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| 2025-02-20 | 41.55  | 35.82        | +5.73      |
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89  | 77.52        | +6.37      |
| 2024-08-01 | 41.9   | 38.37        | +3.53      |
| 2024-05-02 | 20.39  | 14.09        | +6.30      |
| 2024-02-22 | 32     | 29.48        | +2.52      |


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of key financial data (Total Revenue and Gross Profit) significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This lack of information is a major constraint.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, with significant periods of strong alpha.  However, the recent price action, negative expected return, and high risk level warrant caution.  The positive earnings surprises are encouraging, but the lack of key financial data prevents a definitive assessment of the company's overall financial health. Further investigation into the financial statements and industry trends is crucial before making any investment decisions. The current negative long-term expected return needs careful consideration.
