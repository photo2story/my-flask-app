**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $4617.26

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $4694.54
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $4807.44

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent slight increase (0.62%) from the previous close might be a temporary bounce.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4247 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.59 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.002 (Near zero, indicating a lack of strong momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -6.1% (This suggests that BKNG is expected to underperform VOO in the future. This might be a contrarian view given recent performance).  The negative expected return needs further investigation to ensure it accounts for high growth periods present in the alpha/beta analysis.

The small price increase is not significant enough to indicate a sharp rebound. The combination of oversold RSI and negative expected return warrants caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently beaten earnings expectations.

| 날짜 | EPS | 예상 EPS | Beat/Miss |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-02-20 | 41.55 | 35.82 | 5.73 |
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89 | 77.52 | 6.37 |
| 2024-08-01 | 41.9 | 38.37 | 3.53 |
| 2024-05-02 | 20.39 | 14.09 | 6.3 |
| 2024-02-22 | 32 | 29.48 | 2.52 |

Consistent positive surprises indicate strong financial performance.


**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data is available for analysis. This significantly limits the assessment of the company's financial health and sustainability of its growth.  Further financial data is needed for a complete assessment.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Positive earnings surprises show robust growth. However, current technical indicators suggest near-term weakness.  The negative long-term expected return (vs. S&P 500) requires further investigation and clarification given the historical data.  The lack of key financial information (revenue and gross profit) limits a complete evaluation.  A cautious approach is recommended, pending further investigation into the negative expected return and acquisition of missing financial data.  Further research into the discrepancies between the long-term negative expected return and past high growth is highly recommended.
