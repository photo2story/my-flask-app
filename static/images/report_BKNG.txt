**1. Performance Comparison vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **BKNG Cumulative Return:** 76.56%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 66.27%
* **Return Difference:** 10.3%  (This represents BKNG outperforming VOO by 10.3 percentage points over the measured period.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 81.3% (This indicates that the current outperformance of BKNG relative to VOO is in the top 81.3% of historical observations, suggesting a relatively strong recent performance compared to its historical relationship with the S&P 500.)
* **Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided Alpha and Beta values fluctuate significantly year over year, suggesting considerable volatility in outperformance relative to the market (Beta) and in absolute returns independent of market movements (Alpha). The high Alpha values in 2021 and 2022 indicate periods of substantial outperformance.  The significant increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) reflects the company's growth over the period.  However, a detailed analysis of risk-adjusted return is needed, using metrics such as Sharpe Ratio.

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a relatively short-term positive momentum, while it's below the 60-day moving average, implying a potential short-term pullback from recent highs.  The recent price increase of 1.22% indicates a positive daily change.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss | % Beat/Miss |
|------------|----------|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| 2025-02-20 | 41.55    | 35.82         | Beat      | 16.0%       |
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89    | 77.52         | Beat      | 8.2%        |

| 2024-02-22 | 32.00    | 29.48         | Beat      | 8.5%        |

BKNG has consistently beaten earnings expectations in recent quarters, demonstrating strong performance.  However, the lack of long-term data requires caution in extrapolating this trend.

**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data is available, which significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis. This is a critical data gap that needs to be addressed.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has shown strong cumulative returns exceeding the S&P 500, with a recent positive price movement and consistently beating earnings expectations.  However, technical indicators present mixed signals.  The RSI is approaching oversold territory, yet the PPO shows positive momentum. The significant lack of financial data (revenue, gross profit) makes a complete assessment impossible.  The high Alpha in certain periods indicates strong outperformance relative to the market, but the volatility of Alpha and Beta across years suggests a need to consider a more robust risk-adjusted performance measure.  The -10.5% expected return from the current price should be interpreted cautiously given the conflicting short-term and longer-term expectations. Further investigation into fundamentals, including revenue and gross profit data, and a more comprehensive risk assessment (e.g., Sharpe Ratio) are crucial before forming a definitive opinion.  The current information only presents a partial picture of the company's financial health and outlook.
