**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently exceeded earnings expectations in recent quarters.  This suggests strong underlying performance.

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS | Beat/Miss |
|------------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89    | 77.52        | +6.37      |
| 2024-08-01 | 41.9     | 38.37        | +3.53      |

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data significantly limits a complete financial assessment.  Key financial ratios and trends cannot be determined without this information.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500,  consistent earnings beats, and a large market cap. However, recent price action shows a slight downward trend. The lack of critical financial data (revenue, gross profit) prevents a thorough evaluation of the company's financial health and valuation.  The -6.6% expected return is a significant caveat, suggesting potential underperformance relative to the market, although the provided alpha values, especially for the most recent period, show otherwise. A more in-depth analysis requires complete financial statements and a deeper investigation into the company's future growth prospects.  The strong earnings beats provide some optimism, but the lack of key financial metrics and the somewhat negative outlook on long-term returns necessitates a cautious approach.
