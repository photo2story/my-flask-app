**5. Financial Information:**

Insufficient data provided to analyze revenue and gross profit trends. The absence of this key information limits a comprehensive financial assessment.


**6. News and Recent Events:**

Information on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions is not provided.  This makes it challenging to assess the current market sentiment and potential catalysts.


**7. Summary:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical performance against the S&P 500 and has consistently beaten earnings expectations. However, recent technical indicators suggest some short-term weakness.  The lack of revenue and gross profit data, along with missing news and analyst opinions, makes it difficult to form a complete investment thesis. While the long-term expected return is positive, further investigation is required to fully assess the company's prospects.



**8.  Recommendation:**

Further research is recommended to obtain missing financial data (revenue, gross profit) and recent news/analyst opinions before making an investment decision.  The current analysis presents a mixed picture, with strong historical performance and positive earnings surprises contrasted by recent technical weakness and incomplete financial information.
