This report analyzes Booking Holdings Inc., an online travel agency offering hotel reservations, flight tickets, and other travel-related services.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

BKNG has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return of BKNG (169.94%) is substantially higher than that of VOO (121.84%), resulting in a difference of 48.1 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 87.0 indicates BKNG's performance lies in the upper 87th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows high and fluctuating alpha values, particularly in recent years (2021-2025), suggesting periods of significant outperformance relative to the market (high beta values also support this). However, there were periods with negative alpha demonstrating underperformance.  Capitalization (Cap) has steadily increased, reflecting growth in the company.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in the recent periods indicates strong growth. However, the maximum drawdown (MDD) values indicate significant risk, particularly in the 2017-2019 and 2019-2021 periods.

**5. Financial Information:**

Unfortunately, no total revenue or gross profit data was provided, hindering a complete financial analysis.  This crucial information is needed for a comprehensive evaluation of BKNG's financial health.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, with high CAGR and positive alpha in some periods.  However, significant drawdowns highlight inherent risk. Recent earnings have exceeded expectations, indicating robust financial results.  The current high RSI suggests potential short-term volatility, while positive momentum is implied by the PPO. The lack of revenue and gross profit data prevents a complete financial assessment. The long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further explanation to be credible, given the data showing consistent outperformance. Further investigation into the underlying assumptions of the expected return calculation is needed.  A complete analysis requires the missing financial data to assess the overall valuation and risk-reward profile of the investment.
