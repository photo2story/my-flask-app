## Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) Stock Analysis

This report analyzes Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG), a leading online travel agency, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

BKNG's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **BKNG Cumulative Return:** 122.55%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 89.44%
* **Difference:** 33.1%

The relative divergence of 87.6% indicates BKNG's performance is in the top percentile compared to the S&P 500's historical performance over the measured period.  However, this is a snapshot in time and doesn't guarantee future outperformance.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows substantial year-over-year volatility in BKNG's performance.  While recent years show strong growth (94% CAGR in 2022-2024!), the alpha (market-beating return) is highly variable, ranging from -0.2 to 1.9, highlighting the stock's sensitivity to market conditions and the cyclical nature of the travel industry.  The beta is also generally above 1, except for some periods, reflecting a higher-than-average volatility compared to the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 4685.75
* **Last Market Price:** 4707.95
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 4688.77
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 4599.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 4770.76

The price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, above the 20-day moving average, and below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend but a longer-term downward trend. The recent price increase of 0.47 points to a minor upward movement.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4354 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 63.89 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.4452 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -4.9% (BKNG is expected to underperform the S&P 500 by 4.9% over the long term based on current analysis). This negative expected return should be considered in context with the high historical volatility and cyclical nature of the travel industry.  Furthermore, there's little detail about the model used to generate this figure.

BKNG consistently exceeded EPS expectations in recent quarters.  This positive trend suggests strong underlying performance, though future performance isn't guaranteed.


**5. Financial Information:**

No total revenue or gross profit data was provided, hindering a complete financial analysis.  This data is crucial for a thorough assessment of BKNG's financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has shown strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, particularly in the latest reported period, with consistently positive EPS surprises. However, the high volatility, indicated by both the CAGR variability and the beta, combined with a negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 and missing crucial financial data, presents a mixed outlook.  The recent price movement shows a complex trend. While the short-term outlook might be positive based on the moving averages and recent price increase, the long-term outlook is questionable given the long-term predicted underperformance.  Further investigation into the provided 'Expected Return' calculation and the acquisition of missing financial statements (revenue, gross profit) are necessary before drawing definitive conclusions. A thorough risk assessment, considering the cyclical nature of the travel industry, should also be conducted.
