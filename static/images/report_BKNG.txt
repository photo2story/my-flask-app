BKNG consistently beat earnings expectations in the provided data.  This positive trend suggests strong underlying performance. However, this alone does not explain the recent price decline.

**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data were provided.  This is a significant gap in the analysis, as this crucial information is needed for a comprehensive financial assessment.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

BKNG has historically shown strong performance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by high Alpha values in several periods.  The company consistently exceeded earnings expectations. However, the recent sharp price decline and lack of crucial financial information (revenue, gross profit) warrant further investigation.  The short-term outlook appears negative, but the long-term potential remains dependent on the resolution of the factors driving the recent price drop and a comprehensive financial analysis.  The -5.8% expected return and the negative price movement raise concerns.  More data is needed to determine if this is a temporary setback or a more significant trend shift.
