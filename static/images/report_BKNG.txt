**5) Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a complete financial analysis.  This missing information is a significant limitation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

BKNG shows strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, supported by consistently exceeding earnings expectations and positive momentum indicators (PPO). However, the RSI suggests potential short-term corrections, and the projected long-term return is negative against the S&P 500, indicating potential relative underperformance despite impressive historical data. The lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) significantly hinders a comprehensive assessment.  Further investigation into these missing financials, alongside an understanding of the company's future prospects and market conditions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high alpha values should be considered carefully, as they are highly context-dependent and don't guarantee future returns.
