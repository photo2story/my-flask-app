**7. Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistently high beta (generally above 1.0), suggesting that BKNG's price is more volatile than the overall market.  The alpha values vary from negative to strongly positive, indicating periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.  The high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values over most periods highlight the strong growth potential of BKNG. The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values, however, suggest significant risk.


**8. Summary:**

BKNG exhibits strong historical performance exceeding the S&P 500. Recent earnings have significantly outperformed expectations.  However, technical indicators suggest potential short-term corrections despite the overall upward trend.  The lack of crucial financial data (revenue and gross profit) and the reliance on limited news sources restrict a fully comprehensive analysis.  The high beta signifies above-average volatility and risk.  A long-term investment strategy (2+ years) might be suitable for risk-tolerant investors seeking exposure to the travel sector, considering the potential for high growth, balanced with the potential for significant drawdowns.  Further investigation is required to account for the information gaps.
