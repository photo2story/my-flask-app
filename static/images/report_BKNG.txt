**1. Performance & Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency offering hotel reservations, flight tickets, and other travel-related services.

Over the period analyzed, BKNG exhibited a cumulative return of 192.81%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%.  The difference is 63.9 percentage points.  This places BKNG's performance at the 98.9th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, based on the provided data's minimum and maximum divergence.  While this shows superior past performance, it doesn't guarantee future returns.

Alpha and Beta analysis shows consistent outperformance (positive alpha) relative to the market (beta consistently above 1), indicating higher risk but also higher potential returns than the overall market. However,  CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates, highlighting the cyclical nature of the travel industry.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values indicate significant potential for short-term losses, especially in 2018-2020 and 2019-2021.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a short-term overbought condition, warranting caution, but the long-term outlook seems positive.  Recent earnings have exceeded expectations. However, the lack of key financial data (revenue and gross profit) limits a complete assessment.  Analyzing recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a well-rounded view.  The expected return is promising but depends heavily on the accuracy of long-term projections and market conditions. The high beta suggests higher volatility than the market.


**8. Conclusion:**

Booking Holdings Inc. shows considerable promise but requires deeper analysis with the addition of missing financial data and a review of recent news and analyst opinions to provide a more comprehensive and informed recommendation.  The historical outperformance is encouraging, but investors should be aware of the potential volatility associated with this stock. Long-term investors might find the projected outperformance attractive despite the short-term risks.  A thorough risk assessment is necessary before making any investment decision.
