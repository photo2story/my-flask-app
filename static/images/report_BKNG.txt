**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 4616.32
* **Previous Close:** 4164.15
* **Change:** +10.86% (Significant Daily Increase – indicating a potential rapid upward movement.)
* **5-day Moving Average:** 4351.94
* **20-day Moving Average:** 4548.72
* **60-day Moving Average:** 4729.48

The price is above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum, but below the 60-day moving average, indicating potential resistance.  The recent significant daily price increase should be monitored closely for continuation or reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk) – Indicates a higher degree of volatility.
* **RSI:** 50.96 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.41 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.7% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -10.9% (This is a significant negative figure suggesting potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in the long term.  The reason for this negative expectation should be investigated further.)

The large daily price increase contradicts the relatively bearish signals from the PPO and the negative expected return. Further investigation is needed to reconcile these discrepancies.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

BKNG has consistently exceeded expected EPS in recent quarters.


| 날짜       | EPS     | 예상 EPS | Difference |
|------------|---------|----------|------------|
| 2025-02-20 | 41.55   | 35.82    | 5.73       |
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89   | 77.52    | 6.37       |
| 2024-08-01 | 41.90   | 38.37    | 3.53       |
| 2024-05-02 | 20.39   | 14.09    | 6.30       |
| 2024-02-22 | 32.00   | 29.48    | 2.52       |

**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data was provided, preventing a complete financial analysis.  This is a significant omission.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG has demonstrated strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in certain periods.  However, the recent data presents a mixed picture. While recent earnings are positive, and short-term price action is bullish, technical indicators suggest bearish momentum, and the long-term expected return is negatively projected.  The lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) is a significant limitation.  The high risk indicated by the MRI also necessitates caution. A more thorough analysis with complete financial statements and a deeper understanding of the reasons for the negative long-term expected return is strongly recommended before making investment decisions.
