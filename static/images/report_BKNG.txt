*   **RSI:** 38.39 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet there)

**Analysis:**

*   **Risk:** The MRI indicates "Low Risk".
*   **Momentum:** RSI suggests the stock is approaching oversold levels, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity.  However, the negative PPO suggests a continuing downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal recommends a high cash position (65%) and selling a small portion of holdings. This is a cautious signal.
*   **Relative Performance:** The recent decrease in the relative spread suggests underperformance in the short term.
*   **Long-Term Outlook:** The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 suggests that, based on current analysis, BKNG may not outperform the market over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years).

| Date       | EPS   | Expected EPS |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2025-07-29 | 55.4  | 50.32        |
| 2025-04-29 | 24.81 | 17.34        |

| 2024-08-01 | 41.9  | 38.37        |

**Analysis:**

*   BKNG has consistently beaten EPS expectations in the last five quarters. This is a positive sign, indicating strong financial performance.

**6. Financial Data**

*   No 'Total Revenue' or 'Gross Profit' data available for BKNG.

**Analysis:**

*   The missing revenue and profit data is a significant gap. A complete financial analysis requires these figures.

**7. Overall Summary**

BKNG is a major player in the online travel sector. While it has shown strong recent earnings and periods of outperformance (positive alpha in recent years), the analysis presents a mixed picture:

*   **Strengths:** Consistent EPS beats, periods of strong CAGR, a relatively strong historical relative performance vs. VOO (relative spread position), and a "Low Risk" MRI.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Slight underperformance vs. VOO in cumulative return, recent short-term underperformance (negative relative spread change), a negative expected return compared to the S&P 500, negative PPO indicating a downward trend, significant MDD values, and missing key financial data (revenue and gross profit).
*   **Considerations:** Recent news suggests a period of potential volatility and significant events. The Hybrid Signal indicates caution.

**Investment Recommendation:**

Based on this limited data, a cautious approach is warranted. The Hybrid Signal suggests a high cash position and selling a small portion of holdings. Given the negative expected return and the recent short-term underperformance, it may not be the best time to increase exposure to BKNG. It is recommended to closely monitor company news, analyst reports, and obtain missing financial data (revenue and gross profit) before making any investment decisions.
