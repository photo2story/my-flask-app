## Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

Booking Holdings Inc. (BKNG) is a leading online travel agency.  The cumulative return of BKNG (181.35%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return of 124.78%.  The difference is 56.57%, placing it at the 100th percentile of its historical relative outperformance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data. This indicates a strong historical outperformance.  The Alpha values consistently above 1 in the provided data further supports this superior performance relative to the market benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 5017.78
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 4994.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 4731.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 4291.07

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a bullish short-to-medium-term trend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates recent price stability.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (81.41):**  The RSI is significantly above 70, indicating the stock is in overbought territory. This suggests a potential short-term correction could be imminent.
* **PPO (0.02):**  A positive PPO value suggests bullish momentum, although the value is quite low, indicating weaker momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (12.64 +):** This signifies a recent short-term upward trend in relative outperformance compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.24%):**  This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon.  Given the high RSI and relatively small PPO, this should be viewed cautiously.  The high current valuation compared to the S&P 500 makes achieving this expected return less certain in the near term.  If 5016.23 represents a recent significant price spike, this casts doubt on the feasibility of the 0.24% expected return prediction in the near term, a correction to the price could negatively impact this figure.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

| Date       | EPS      | Expected EPS |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 83.89    | 77.52       |

| 2023-11-02 | 72.32    | 67.61       |

The most recent EPS (83.89) exceeded expectations (77.52), demonstrating strong performance.  However, a consistent upward trend is not immediately apparent from the given data. Further analysis is required to assess long-term financial health.

**6. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This crucial information is needed to understand the company's overall financial health and growth prospects.

**7. News, Recent Issues, and Market Outlook:**

*(This section requires access to real-time news sources such as Shacknews and FINBOLD to provide current information on recent earnings news, analyst opinions, and market outlook for BKNG.  Please provide access or specify dates for relevant news to include this analysis.)*

**8. Overall Summary:**

BKNG has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong cumulative returns and positive alpha.  Recent earnings have been strong, exceeding expectations.  However, the stock is currently in overbought territory (high RSI), and the lack of key financial data (revenue, gross profit) limits a complete assessment. The relatively small PPO adds to concern over the long term sustainability of current pricing.  A price spike needs further investigation to determine if it will have a significant impact on valuation.  Access to recent news and analyst opinions is essential for a more complete picture.
