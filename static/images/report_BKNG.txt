The analysis shows high volatility (MDD) and fluctuating Alpha and Beta.  Recent years (2021-2024) show significantly higher CAGR and positive Alpha, suggesting outperformance of the market. However, the large swings in Alpha highlight the risk involved.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $4573.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $4573.99
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $4568.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $4708.10

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average and slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a relatively stable short-term trend.  However, it's below the 60-day average, indicating a potential downward trend in the medium term.  The recent daily change (0.72) indicates a minor positive change.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 47.96 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.42 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, though relatively low magnitude)
* **20-Day Relative Deviation Change:** +2.3 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -16.9% (This represents a negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon.)  This suggests that despite the past outperformance, current market expectations do not project similar future outperformance.

The recent price increase of 0.72 is minor and does not suggest a significant upward or downward event.

**5. Financial Information:**

No revenue or gross profit data was provided, hindering a complete financial analysis.  This is a significant limitation to the overall assessment.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

BKNG has shown slightly better cumulative returns than the S&P 500, but recent technical indicators suggest a more neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook.  However, consistently positive earnings surprises and a historical trend of strong performance (particularly in recent years) point to potentially positive long-term prospects. The lack of revenue and gross profit data significantly limits a comprehensive assessment.  The negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 suggests caution and emphasizes the need for further in-depth financial analysis before making any investment decisions. The high volatility necessitates a risk tolerance appropriate for this level of fluctuation.
