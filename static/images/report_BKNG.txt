**5. Financial Information:**

No Total Revenue or Gross Profit data is available.  This lack of key financial metrics significantly limits a complete fundamental analysis.  Further research is needed to obtain this essential data.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

BKNG shows a strong historical relative performance against the S&P 500, with a substantial cumulative return exceeding that of the benchmark index.  However, the provided long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500. Recent earnings have consistently surpassed expectations, indicating robust financial health.  The RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, while the PPO indicates bearish short-term momentum.  The missing key financial data (revenue and gross profit) is a significant constraint to a complete assessment. Further investigation is needed to reconcile the strong historical performance with the projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and to gain a clearer understanding of the company's financial health using complete financial data. The recent price increase should also be monitored in connection with these factors.
