## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Analysis Report

**0) Overview:** C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

C3.ai's cumulative return (-15.20%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 59.45%.  The difference (-74.7%) places it at the 9.2nd percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500 (considering a historical range of -89.3% to 70%). This indicates a substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance:

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                    |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| 2020-2022  | -96.0%  | 25.9%  | -86.0% | 0.0   | 1.5     | Extremely poor performance, low beta.     |
| 2021-2023  | -24.0%  | 45.4%  | -48.0% | 0.0   | 3.7     | Continued underperformance, low beta.      |
| 2022-2024  | 82.0%   | 45.4%  | 49.0%  | 0.0   | 4.5     | Significant positive return, low beta. |
| 2023-2025  | 13.0%   | 45.4%  | -44.0% | 0.1   | 3.0     | Modest return, low beta.                 |

The consistently low beta suggests limited correlation with the overall market, while the fluctuating CAGR highlights significant volatility and unpredictable performance.  The Alpha near zero indicates that the stock's performance is largely explained by market movements, not by superior manager skill.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $23.45
* **Last Market Price:** $23.63 (Slight increase from previous close)
* **5-day Moving Average:** $25.396
* **20-day Moving Average:** $30.481
* **60-day Moving Average:** $33.9607

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 18.199  (Extremely oversold, potentially indicating a bounce, but not guaranteed.)
* **PPO:** -2.896 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum.)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -10.1% (Short-term bearish divergence.)
* **Expected Return:** -330.8% (This is an exceptionally negative projection and needs further clarification on its calculation methodology.  It's crucial to understand what assumptions underpin this forecast.)

The recent price change of $0.18 (0.76%) is not significant enough to be classified as a rapid upward or downward movement.  The extremely negative expected return (-330.8%) raises significant concerns.  Such a large negative figure requires further explanation and likely incorporates significant downside risk factors not yet disclosed.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      | Notes                                           |
|------------|--------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 0.72   | $6.75B       |                                                   |
| 2024-08-01 | -6.02  | $6.56B       | Significant loss                                  |
| 2024-05-02 | 1.75   | $6.76B       |                                                   |
| 2023-11-02 | 2.83   | $7.27B       |                                                   |
| 2024-11-07 | 2.83   | $7.27B       | Duplicate entry; likely a data entry error?    |


Earnings are volatile and inconsistent.  The large loss in Q1 2025 (-6.02 EPS) is alarming.  There seems to be a duplicate entry for November 7th, 2024, requiring clarification.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable around $0.09B but profit margin is slightly declining.


| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |

| Quarter | Equity | ROE      |
|---------|---------|----------|

**6) Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, coupled with high volatility and inconsistent earnings. While the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the negative PPO and substantial negative expected return (-330.8%, which requires further clarification) raise serious concerns. The negative ROE further adds to the risk profile.  Before considering any investment, a thorough review of the company's fundamentals, a deeper understanding of the -330.8% expected return calculation, and clarification of the data inconsistencies are crucial.  The current data suggests a high-risk investment with significant potential for further losses.  Further due diligence and a more detailed analysis are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
