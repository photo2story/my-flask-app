*   **Current Close:** 15.82
*    **Last-market price': 15.27, 'previousClose': 15.92, 'change': -4.08}**
*   **5-day SMA:** 15.54
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.38
*   **60-day SMA:** 16.62

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 60-day SMA but above its 5-day and 20-day SMAs. This suggests a recent upward trend following a longer-term downtrend or consolidation. However, the 'change' value indicates a recent negative price movement.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 70.58 (Approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** 2.32 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (71 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.8 (+) - 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -643.6%

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI suggests the stock might be approaching overbought conditions, potentially signaling a future pullback.
*   The positive PPO indicates positive momentum, supporting the short-term increase noted in the relative divergence change.
*   The high negative Expected Return is very concerning and suggests significant downside risk if held long-term. The 'price': 15.27, 'previousClose': 15.92, 'change': -4.08} is large, reflecting the fluctuation issue (sharp rebound, sharp decline).
*  The Hybrid signal gives a very optimistic outlook, which clashes with the other indicators.

C3.ai presents a mixed picture. While the company shows positive momentum and high profit margins in some areas, significant concerns remain:

*   **Volatility:** High MDD in the alpha/beta analysis indicates significant price volatility.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Neutral analyst ratings with a wide target price range reflect a lack of conviction.
*   **Inconsistent Earnings and Revenue:** EPS and revenue figures are somewhat erratic, including a possible data duplication issue.
*   **Negative ROE:** Negative Return on Equity signals profitability issues.
*   **News Sentiment:** News headlines show conflicting views on AI stocks and specific concerns about C3.ai's valuation and competition.
*   **The Hybrid signal gives a very optimistic outlook, which clashes with the other indicators.**
*   **Inconsistent data:** There is conflicting Revenue data from the earnings reports and financial information (revenue reported in Billions (B) vs millions (M). The same issue arises with the EPS report.
    

**Conclusion:** Based on this analysis, a cautious approach to C3.ai is warranted. The negative Expected Return, inconsistent earnings, and high volatility suggest that this stock carries significant risk. While there are some positive indicators (positive PPO, high profit margins), these are outweighed by the concerns. Further due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.
