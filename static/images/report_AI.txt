    *   AI: -42.64%
    *   VOO (S&P 500): 49.50%

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -64.0%   | 77.9%   | -40.0%   | -0.1   | 1.6    |
| 2021-2023  | 6.0%    | 82.8%   | 5.0%    | -0.0   | 4.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 59.0%   | 82.8%   | 39.0%   | 0.0    | 4.8    |
| 2023-2025  | -5.0%   | 82.8%   | -71.0%   | 0.0    | 2.0    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Highly volatile, ranging from negative to positive, indicating inconsistent growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high drawdowns suggest significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Fluctuates significantly, suggesting periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to its benchmark, recently heavily underperforming.
*   **Beta:** Consistently near zero or negative, indicating that the stock's price is generally not correlated with the broader market (S&P 500). This can be positive if the market declines, but negative if the market rises as AI does not rise with it.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):** The company's capitalization has fluctuated significantly, implying market sentiment changes.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 14.44
*   **Previous Close:** 13.77
*   **Change:** 4.87%
*   **5-day SMA:** 14.28
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.70
*   **60-day SMA:** 16.24

**Analysis:** The current price shows a recent increase (4.87%). The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day SMA, which is below the 60-day SMA. This *could* suggest a potential bottoming formation, but the 60-day SMA still acts as resistance.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 50.81 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.17 (Slightly bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** 100% Buy (Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -2.3 (Negative)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1418.0%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment risk level, but this should be considered alongside other indicators.
*   The RSI around 50 is neutral, implying neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   The negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, suggesting a slight downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal's "100% Buy" recommendation, despite the negative expected return, seems contradictory and should be viewed cautiously, as it does not reflect current data.
*   The negative change in relative divergence indicates a short-term downward trend.
*   **Crucially, the extremely negative "Expected Return" is a major red flag and requires further investigation. It suggests very poor long-term prospects based on the current model.**

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes:** The news articles show a mixed outlook:
    *   **Positive:** Some articles highlight potential for AI stocks in 2026 and suggest C3.ai could be a "surprising winner."
    *   **Negative:** Comparison articles may highlight competitors (SoundHound AI). Some articles discuss Wall Street's selective approach to AI stocks.
    *   **Mixed:** General market overviews mention AI stocks rebounding but also point to uncertainty and varied forecasts. Cathie Wood's activity indicates portfolio adjustments in AI holdings.
*   **Impact:** The news suggests that while the AI sector remains attractive, investor sentiment toward C3.ai is not uniformly positive and is subject to shifts in focus.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 3.43 (Hold)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 12
*   **Target Price:**
    *   Average: 14.67
    *   High: 24.00
    *   Low: 8.00

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus is a "Hold" with an average target price slightly above the current price. This suggests a limited upside potential according to analysts. The wide range between high and low target prices indicates significant uncertainty about the stock's future.  The lack of recent rating changes makes it difficult to gauge current momentum.
