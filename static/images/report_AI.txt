**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* *(This section requires access to recent news articles from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai shows significant volatility and underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While some short-term positive momentum is suggested by the RSI and relative strength change, negative PPO, and consistently negative ROE signal caution.  The highly volatile financial performance and lack of positive long-term projected return raises significant concerns.  A thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions, along with a detailed analysis of the most recent earnings report (including expectations), is essential before forming any investment decisions.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current data, a long-term investment in C3.ai requires a high risk tolerance. The substantial underperformance compared to the market, negative ROE, and uncertain future outlook warrant further in-depth research, especially focusing on the most recent earnings report, and a comprehensive analysis of the news and analyst opinions before considering any investment.  Diversification within a broader portfolio is strongly recommended.
