More detailed information and analysis are needed for a complete evaluation.


| Date        | EPS   | Revenue       |

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The revenue is relatively stable, but profit margins are relatively high, though profitability overall is impacted by operating expenses. The negative Return on Equity (ROE) across all quarters indicates the company is not generating returns for its shareholders in excess of its cost of equity.  This is concerning and merits further investigation into the causes.
