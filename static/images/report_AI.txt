**1) Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  Over the analyzed period, C3.ai significantly underperformed the S&P 500, exhibiting a -49.6% difference in cumulative returns.  While the relative divergence suggests this underperformance is not entirely unprecedented, it still represents a substantial lag.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha/beta data reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta > 1 suggests higher volatility than the market).  While recent periods (2022-2024 and 2023-2025) show positive CAGR and alpha, earlier periods highlight significant negative returns and near-zero alpha, indicating periods of underperformance relative to the market.  High Beta values consistently suggest significant market volatility influence.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -96.0%   | 25.9%    | -86.0% | 0.0   | 1.4    |
| 2021-2023  | -24.0%   | 45.4%    | -48.0% | 0.0   | 3.7    |
| 2022-2024  | 82.0%    | 45.4%    | 49.0%  | 0.0   | 4.4    |

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $31.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $33.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $34.02

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price drop of -$2.18 (from $32.05) further reinforces this downward trend.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.71 (slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.28 (negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -2.0 (indicates a recent short-term decline)
* **Expected Return:** -100.0% (This indicates a highly negative expectation, but the context for a 2+ year timeframe and comparison to the S&P 500 is missing. It needs clarification)

The combination of a negative PPO, negative relative divergence, and recent price decline paints a bearish picture.  The significantly negative expected return requires further explanation or clarification as to what this percentage represents.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's a need for further analysis to determine the underlying causes of such fluctuations.  Note that the 2024-11-07 entry appears duplicated in the data.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | $0.72   | $6.75B       |

| 2023-11-02 | $2.83   | $7.27B       |
| 2024-11-07 | $2.83   | $7.27B       |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, while profit margins are consistently high. However, the negative ROE across all quarters raises serious concerns about the company's profitability and return on invested capital.

|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31  | $0.09B     | 61.31%        |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai's performance is currently concerning. While it shows periods of high growth and profitability in specific time frames (2022-2024), the overall trend relative to the S&P 500 is significantly negative, particularly considering the negative ROE and inconsistent earnings. The high beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  Technical indicators point towards a bearish short-term outlook.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the volatile earnings and negative ROE before making any investment decisions.  The -100% expected return requires clarification to provide a meaningful conclusion.  The provided data suggests significant risk and requires a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and future outlook before any investment recommendation can be made.
