*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown values are relatively high, especially for the latest period, indicating substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is very volatile. It shows C3.ai generated returns above its benchmark in one period but underperformed significantly in the most recent period (negative Alpha).

*   **5-day SMA:** 13.86
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.28
*   **60-day SMA:** 15.35

**Analysis:**

The stock price is below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The close being above the 5-day SMA, coupled with a positive change in the last market, may indicate a potential short-term rebound.

*   **RSI:** 46.98 (Neutral)

**Analysis:**

The MRI of 0.7 suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is near the middle range (46.98), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The PPO is positive but quite low, indicating weak momentum. The Hybrid Signal suggests a cautious buying opportunity, but with only 80% of available funds. Recent positive divergence indicates potential short-term upward price movement. The extremely negative Expected Return is highly concerning and could indicate significant risks or overly pessimistic model assumptions. The high change in last market indicates a fluctuation issue (sharp rebound, sharp decline).

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Billionaire Israel Englander Sells Palantir and Buys AI Stock:** Suggests potential shifting sentiment within the AI sector. *It's crucial to identify which AI stock Englander purchased.*
*   **Palantir or Oracle? AI Analyst Picks...:** Highlights the competitive landscape within the AI space.
*   **Prediction: This Monster AI Stock Will Reach a $5 Trillion Market Cap in 2026:** Indicates extreme optimism for a specific AI stock. *Again, critical to know which stock is being referenced.*
*   **3 Brilliant AI Stocks That Could Double in 2026:** Shows general optimism, but the specific stocks mentioned matter.
*   **Hey SoundHound—Why Is Your Stock Suddenly on Fire? / Is SoundHound AI Stock a Buy Now?:** Focuses on a competitor, potentially diverting investor attention.

**Analysis:**

The news is a mixed bag. There is clearly a lot of hype and optimism surrounding the AI sector as a whole. However, the fact that Englander is selling Palantir and shifting to "an AI stock" is concerning for Palantir and potentially positive for the unnamed new holding. The articles praising specific AI stocks (that aren't C3.ai, based on the article titles) suggest that investor attention may be focused elsewhere. News surrounding SoundHound AI could represent increased competition.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Mean Recommendation:** Not provided, indicated by "-"
*   **Opinions:** 12
*   **Target Price:** Average: 14.67 / High: 24.00 / Low: 8.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not provided, indicated by " → ()"

**Analysis:**

The absence of a mean recommendation makes judging analyst sentiment difficult, but the number of opinions (12) shows good coverage. The average target price of 14.67 is slightly above the current price, suggesting modest upside potential according to analysts, but the wide range of target prices (8.00 - 24.00) indicates considerable uncertainty. The lack of information on recent rating changes further limits the analysis.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출     |
|------------|------|----------|
| 2025-11-05 | 0.94 | 6.35 B$  |
| 2025-08-07 | 2    | 7.09 B$  |
| 2025-05-02 | 1.18 | 6.78 B$  |
| 2024-11-07 | 0.72 | 6.75 B$  |
| 2025-11-05 | 0.72 | 6.75 B$  |

**Analysis:**

There's an inconsistency: the last row has the same date as the first. Assuming the table represents sequential quarters:

*   EPS shows volatility, with no clear upward or downward trend.
*   Revenue is also fluctuating.

The numbers appear to be in billions of dollars, which seem unrealistic.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

C3.ai has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating higher volatility (Beta). The recent stock price is below its short-term moving averages, but there is a recent short-term rise. While the Market Risk Indicator suggests a medium investment, the extremely negative Expected Return is concerning. Analyst target prices suggest moderate upside, but there is significant disagreement among analysts. Revenue is volatile, and the company is currently operating at a loss (negative ROE). Recent news highlights strong interest in AI, but the company seems to be ignored. Overall, C3.ai appears to be a risky investment with significant challenges.
