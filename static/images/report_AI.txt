| Metric | Ticker (AI) | Comparison (VOO/S&P 500) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Cumulative Return | **-43.56%** | **48.98%** |

**Degree of Divergence Analysis:**
The cumulative return of C3.ai (AI) is **-92.54 percentage points** lower than the S&P 500 (VOO). This represents severe underperformance.

**Relative Divergence:** 0.4
*Interpretation:* The current level of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is situated near the historical minimum fluctuation point (min: -93.1), indicating that the stock's relative weakness is currently at an extreme low.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis Table Review:**

| Year | CAGR | MDD | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2021-2023 | 6.0% | 43.0% | 5.0% | 2.2 | 4.0 |
| 2022-2024 | 59.0% | 41.5% | 40.0% | 2.2 | 4.8 |
| 2023-2025 | -9.0% | 53.2% | -71.0% | 2.3 | 1.9 |

**Analysis:**
1.  **High Volatility (Beta):** The Beta consistently remains above 2.0 (2.2 to 2.3), confirming that AI is highly sensitive to market movements, experiencing roughly twice the volatility of the overall market.
2.  **Performance Swings:** The stock has experienced extremely volatile periods: high growth (59.0% CAGR in 2022-2024 with strong 40.0% Alpha) followed by significant contraction and value destruction (-9.0% CAGR and -71.0% Alpha in 2023-2025).
3.  **Risk (MDD):** Maximum Drawdown (MDD) has been consistently high, reaching 53.2% in the most recent period, reinforcing the stock’s speculative nature and high risk. The market cap has sharply decreased from $4.8B to $1.9B, reflecting the recent negative performance.

### 2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Current Close Price | **$14.02** |
| Last Market Change | Up 1.37% (from $13.83) |
| 5-day SMA | $13.91 |
| 20-day SMA | $14.19 |
| 60-day SMA | $15.27 |

**Analysis:**
The current price ($14.02) is slightly above the very short-term (5-day) average, indicating minor positive momentum following the recent 1.37% price increase. However, the stock is trading below both the 20-day ($14.19) and significantly below the 60-day ($15.27) simple moving averages. This configuration suggests that while there was a slight recent rebound, the stock remains in a medium-term downtrend.

### 3) Technical Indicators and Risk Assessment

| Indicator | Value | Interpretation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Market Risk Indicator (MRI) | 0.7 | Low Investment (Borderline Caution) |
| RSI (Relative Strength Index) | 53.52 | Neutral (Slightly above the 50 midpoint) |
| PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) | 0.1714 | Slightly positive momentum |
| Recent Relative Divergence Change | -1.2 | Short-term trend decline (단기하락) |
| Expected Return (%) | -1545.1 | Extremely negative long-term forecast |

**Analysis:**
The technical signals are mixed but leaning towards caution. The RSI is neutral (53.52). However, the MRI is at 0.7 (indicating *Low Investment Recommended*), and the model forecasts an exceptionally negative long-term expected return (-1545.1%), suggesting that the model sees high risks associated with holding the stock for an extended period. The hybrid signal recommends a cautious approach.

### 4) Recent News & Analyst Opinions

**Recent News Analysis (Focus: General AI Sector Hype):**
The recent news headlines (Jan 8–11, 2026) are entirely focused on the broader AI sector, discussing competitors (Nvidia, SoundHound AI, Palantir, BigBear.ai) and the search for the "best" AI stock. Crucially, C3.ai (AI) itself is not the subject of any recent headline, suggesting that short-term price movements are likely driven by general sector sentiment and volatility rather than company-specific catalysts.

**Analyst Opinions:**
| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Mean (1=StrongBuy~5=Sell) | - |
| Number of Opinions | 12 |
| Average Target Price | $14.67 |
| High / Low Target Price | $24.00 / $8.00 |

**Analysis:**
The average target price of $14.67 offers only a minor upside (~4.6%) from the current price of $14.02. The very wide range between the high ($24.00) and low ($8.00) targets indicates significant uncertainty and disagreement among analysts regarding the long-term valuation of C3.ai.

### 5) Recent Earnings Analysis (Note on Data Inconsistency)

*Note: The revenue figures provided in this table (in the billions) are highly inconsistent with the market capitalization (below $2B) and detailed financial statements of C3.ai (in the millions/Section 6). Assuming this data applies to a larger company, we analyze the provided numbers.*

| Date | EPS | Revenue |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 2025-11-05 | 0.94 | 6.35 B$ |
| 2025-08-07 | 2.00 | 7.09 B$ |
| 2025-05-02 | 1.18 | 6.78 B$ |
| 2024-11-07 | 0.72 | 6.75 B$ |
| 2025-11-05 | 0.72 | 6.75 B$ |

**Analysis of Provided Earnings Data:**
The revenue figures show stability in the $6.35B to $7.09B range. EPS, however, shows high volatility, with a significant spike to $2.00 in August 2025, followed by a sharp drop back to $0.94 and eventually $0.72. This volatility suggests operational inconsistency or the influence of one-time events on profitability.

### 6) Financial Information (C3.ai Specifics)

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 2025-10-31 | $0.08B | 40.43% |
| 2025-07-31 | $0.07B | 37.64% |
| 2025-04-30 | $0.11B | 62.09% |
| 2025-01-31 | $0.10B | 59.07% |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.09B | 61.31% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 2025-10-31 | $0.77B | -13.56% |
| 2025-07-31 | $0.80B | -14.62% |
| 2025-04-30 | $0.84B | -9.51% |
| 2025-01-31 | $0.86B | -9.32% |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.86B | -7.68% |

**Analysis:**
1.  **Revenue & Margin:** Quarterly revenue (in the millions) shows limited growth and volatility ($70M to $110M). While the Profit Margin (Gross Margin) remains high, often above 59%, indicating strong pricing power and controlled Cost of Goods Sold, this high gross margin is not translating to net profitability.
2.  **Net Profitability (ROE):** Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently and deeply negative, worsening significantly in the latter half of 2025 (reaching -14.62% in Q2 2025). This confirms that C3.ai is currently operating at a substantial net loss.
3.  **Balance Sheet:** Shareholder Equity has been consistently declining quarter-over-quarter (from $0.86B to $0.77B), which is a sign of continued operational losses eroding the company's capital base.

### 7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)

C3.ai (AI) is a high-volatility, high-risk, and speculative stock that relies heavily on the broad "AI hype."

**Performance:** The stock has drastically underperformed the S&P 500, with a cumulative return divergence of -92.5%, positioning its relative performance near historical lows (Relative Divergence: 0.4). Historical analysis shows periods of explosive Alpha but also periods of severe value destruction, underpinned by persistently high volatility (Beta > 2.0).

**Fundamentals (Bearish):** Despite high gross profit margins (around 60%), C3.ai remains fundamentally unprofitable, evidenced by consistently negative and worsening Return on Equity (ROE reaching -14.62%) and declining shareholder equity. The current valuation relies more on future potential than current financial strength.

**Technical Outlook:** The stock is in a medium-term downtrend (below 20-day and 60-day SMAs). The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.7 suggests caution, and the technical model forecasts an extremely poor long-term expected return (-1545.1%).

**Conclusion:** C3.ai presents high risk. While the AI sector provides potential tailwinds, the company’s inability to translate high gross margins into net profitability, coupled with extreme stock volatility and historically poor relative performance, dictates an investment profile suitable only for highly risk-tolerant investors looking for exposure to speculative growth, guided by a low average analyst target price ($14.67). Caution is strongly advised due to deteriorating fundamental metrics.
