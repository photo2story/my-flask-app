The difference is -49.6%, placing it at the 24.9th percentile of historical divergence relative to the S&P 500 (based on a range of -89.3% to 70%).

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -96.0% | 25.9% | -86.0% | 0.0 | 1.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -24.0% | 45.4% | -48.0% | 0.0 | 3.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 82.0% | 45.4% | 49.0% | 0.0 | 4.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 42.0% | 45.4% | -19.0% | 0.1 | 4.0 |

The analysis shows high volatility (MDD) and significant negative CAGR in earlier periods (2020-2022 and 2021-2023), followed by strong positive returns in 2022-2024.  The consistently low or near-zero alpha suggests that C3.ai's returns have not significantly outperformed the market, considering its beta.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.09B | 61.31%      |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.09B | 59.81%      |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.09B | 59.60%      |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.08B | 57.76%      |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.07B | 56.14%      |

Revenue is relatively stable, showing slight growth. Profit margins are consistently high, but this needs to be considered in context of the negative EPS and ROE.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE       |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.86B | -7.68%    |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B | -7.18%    |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.87B | -8.35%    |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.90B | -8.09%    |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.91B | -7.66%    |

Negative ROE consistently throughout the period indicates that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity investment.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai shows significant volatility and inconsistent performance.  While profit margins are high, negative ROE and fluctuating earnings raise serious concerns about long-term sustainability.  The substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the negative expected return highlight considerable risk.  The provided -100% expected return needs further scrutiny. Investors should carefully consider these factors before investing.  Further investigation into the discrepancies in the data (e.g., duplicated earnings data) is necessary.
