| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -96.0% | 25.9% | -86.0% | 0.0 | 1.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -24.0% | 45.4% | -48.0% | 0.0 | 3.7 |

| 2023-2025  | 43.0% | 45.4% | -20.0% | 0.1 | 4.1 |

**Analysis:**  C3.ai exhibits high volatility (MDD), especially in the earlier periods.  The negative alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market, though this has improved in recent periods. The beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.  The substantial increase in market capitalization reflects investor interest, despite fluctuating performance.

* **20-day Moving Average:** $32.73
* **60-day Moving Average:** $35.12

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. The recent price increase of $0.697 (from the previous close) may indicate a temporary bounce.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai exhibits strong revenue growth with high profit margins but faces challenges related to earnings volatility and negative ROE, suggesting underlying financial instability. While the stock's short-term price movement is showing some minor signs of recovery after a recent period of negative performance, its significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and a projected negative long-term return raise significant concerns.  Further investigation into the reasons for the inconsistent earnings and negative ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data suggests a high-risk investment, especially considering the extremely negative projected long-term return.  Investors should proceed with caution.  The accuracy of the analysis is limited by the provided data and potential errors in the provided datasets need clarification.
