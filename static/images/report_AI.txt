**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -64.0% | 77.9% | -40.0% | -0.1 | 1.6    |
| 2021-2023  | 6.0%  | 82.8% | 5.0%   | -0.0 | 4.0    |

| 2023-2025  | -7.0% | 82.8% | -75.0% | 0.0  | 2.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, highlighting volatility.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is inconsistent, showing periods of both outperformance and significant underperformance relative to a benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta is low, suggesting the stock is not highly correlated with the overall market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 13.99
*   **Last Market Data:** Price 13.95, Previous Close 13.99, Change -0.29
*   **5-day SMA:** 14.22
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.76
*   **60-day SMA:** 16.03

**Analysis:**

The stock price is trading below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The decreasing moving averages indicate ongoing downward momentum. The small change in the last market data doesn't necessarily point to any immediate sharp rebounds or declines.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 38.95
*   **PPO:** -0.33
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20 days):** -2.3 (Downward Trend)
*   **Expected Return:** -1418.0%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests high investment recommended, which may be contradictory to the other indicators.
*   The RSI is below 40, nearing oversold territory. This could indicate a potential buying opportunity if you believe in the company long term, but it also suggests current weak momentum.
*   The negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, signaling a downtrend.
*   The negative change in relative divergence confirms a short-term decline.
*   The significantly negative expected return suggests a very pessimistic outlook for the stock's future performance compared to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   The news headlines present a mixed picture. Some articles are cautionary ("Don't Buy SoundHound AI Stock") or highlight potential bubble concerns, while others express optimism ("AI Stock Is Quietly Outperforming Nvidia," "Prediction: This AI Stock Could Be the First New $2 Trillion Company").
*   The presence of articles discussing "AI bubble" suggests market perception of risk.
*   The MSFT vs. ORCL article indicates competition in the AI space.
*   The BigBear.ai article highlights company-specific events that may influence investor sentiment.

**Analysis:**

The news sentiment is mixed, with both positive and negative articles appearing. This creates uncertainty for investors.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 3.43 (Hold)
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 14.67 / 24.00 / 8.00

**Analysis:**

Analysts have a "Hold" consensus on the stock, suggesting they don't see a compelling reason to buy or sell at the current price. The average target price is slightly above the current price, but the wide range (8.00 to 24.00) reflects considerable uncertainty.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

C3.ai (AI) presents a mixed investment picture.

*   **Negative Signals:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, is in a short-term downtrend based on moving averages, and has a negative expected return. ROE is negative and declining, and equity is also declining. Analyst ratings are neutral ("Hold").

**Overall:**

The data suggests a high-risk investment. While there might be potential for a rebound, the significant underperformance, negative return expectations, decreasing equity, and mixed news sentiment warrant caution. The analyst consensus of "Hold" reflects this uncertainty. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further due diligence before investing in AI.
