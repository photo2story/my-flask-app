## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  The cumulative return of C3.ai (19.81%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (68.42%) by 48.6 percentage points.  This places its relative divergence at the 37.2nd percentile of its historical range (min -99.5%, max 37.5%).  This indicates that while C3.ai has shown positive returns, its performance is substantially below the benchmark index over the period considered.


**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -82.0%  | 35.8%   | -73.0% | -0.0  | 1.0   |
| 2021-2023  | -27.0%  | 45.5%   | -52.0% | -0.0  | 4.0   |
| 2022-2024  | 84.0%   | 45.5%   | 43.0%  | -0.0  | 4.0   |

The high volatility and negative alpha in the earlier periods (2020-2023) indicate significant underperformance relative to the market. The positive CAGR in 2022-2024 suggests a recent recovery, but further analysis is needed to assess sustainability.  The Beta values are inconsistent and require further investigation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $37.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $37.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $30.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $26.33

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent uptrend. However, the relatively larger gap between the current price and the 20- and 60-day averages indicates that this uptrend might be relatively recent.  The last market price of $36.16 reflects a minor dip, but not a significant drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 76.40  (Overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 2.41 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** NaN (-) (Insufficient data to interpret)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests that a long-term (2+ years) investment in C3.ai is not expected to outperform the S&P 500 based on the provided information.  This needs further validation.)
