**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  The cumulative return of C3.ai (43.6%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (64.3%) by 20.7 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -20.7% indicates that C3.ai's performance is below the S&P 500, placing it in the lower 43.1% of its historical range of performance relative to the index.  The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta values show high volatility and inconsistency in performance over the observed periods.  Note that the Alpha is consistently 0.0, suggesting the stock's returns are entirely explained by market movements.  A beta above 1 (reaching 5.0) highlights its heightened sensitivity to market fluctuations.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $39.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $36.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $29.04

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting recent minor downward pressure. However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend, though the price action is not particularly strong.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 57.12 – This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.62 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.6 – This points to a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – The provided data does not offer sufficient justification for a specific long-term expected return.  A long-term investment in C3.ai with a 2+ year horizon carries significant risk and may not outperform the S&P 500 based on historical data provided.  The high beta suggests elevated volatility. The recent price around $39.45 does not reflect significant changes, neither a rapid upward nor a rapid downward movement.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows considerable volatility:

* **Revenue:** Shows inconsistency, with significant jumps and drops between quarters.  No clear upward trend is evident.
* **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Highly variable, swinging from significant losses to substantial profits between quarters. This demonstrates operational instability.

There is no information provided to compare actual results against expectations, therefore any assessment of beats or misses is impossible.  Further, the duplicated 2024-11-07 entry requires clarification.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable. ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating returns on its equity. This is a significant red flag for investors.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500.
