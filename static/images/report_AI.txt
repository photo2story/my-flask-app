**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

C3.ai Inc. (AI) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a large negative divergence in cumulative returns. While recent news suggests potential positive momentum in the AI sector, the company's financial indicators raise concerns. Specifically, the very high *Expected Return* is usually only found with a data error. This needs to be checked or clarified.

**Analysis:**

*   **Performance vs. S&P 500:** The substantial negative divergence (-92.8) highlights a significant underperformance compared to the broader market.  The low relative divergence (0.2) indicates that this underperformance is near the worst levels seen in the tracked data.
*   **Alpha/Beta:** Beta consistently above 2 across all periods means the stock is highly volatile compared to the market.  Negative Alpha in the most recent period (2023-2025) suggests the stock is underperforming its expected return based on its Beta.
*   **Recent Stock Activity:** The small positive change in price (2.0%) is a small rebound. The shorter-term moving average (5-day SMA) is slightly below the longer-term averages (20-day and 60-day SMA), suggesting a recent downtrend.
*   **Indicators:**
    *   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a medium investment risk.
    *   A very low RSI (25.62) indicates the stock might be oversold.
    *   The negative PPO (-0.42) suggests a downward trend in price.
    *   The recent divergence change indicates short-term upward movement.
*   **News & Events:** Recent news headlines are overwhelmingly positive about AI stocks and C3.ai specifically, particularly regarding potential gains in 2026. Insider buying could signal confidence within the company.
*   **Analyst Opinions:**  The target price average of $14.67 is slightly higher than the current price of $13.75, suggesting analysts anticipate some upside.
*   **Earnings:** While revenue figures are substantial, interpreting "B$" requires clarifying the currency.  The table format is also slightly inconsistent (e.g., duplicate date 2025-11-05).
*   **Financial Information:**
    *   While profit margins are high, Revenue numbers in dollars (e.g., $0.08B) seem significantly low, which may imply a problem with unit of measurement. This requires verification.
    *   Negative ROE values indicate unprofitability.
*   **Comprehensive summary**
        The company has been unprofitable in the past, with negative ROE values and negative expected return.

**Recommendation:**

Given the high volatility, recent underperformance, and concerning financial indicators, a cautious approach is warranted.  Positive news sentiment and potential for AI sector growth should be weighed against the risks. Further investigation is required to verify revenue and earnings figures and understand the company's path to profitability. Verify if the high Expected return may be data error.
