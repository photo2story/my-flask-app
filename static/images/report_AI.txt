## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Review

This report analyzes C3.ai Inc. (AI), a provider of enterprise AI software.  The analysis is based solely on the provided data and does not incorporate external market information or analyst opinions beyond what is explicitly given.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

C3.ai's cumulative return over the analyzed period is 51.86%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 63.81%.  This represents a difference of **-11.95%**, placing it at the 48.6th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility, with large swings in performance year over year.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $41.73
* **5-day Moving Average:** $39.80
* **20-day Moving Average:** $34.57
* **60-day Moving Average:** $28.28

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend. The distance between the closing price and the moving averages indicates a relatively strong recent price increase.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 78.94 (Indicates overbought conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.96 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +11.6% (Significant short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0% (This suggests no significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is expected over the long term based on the provided data alone.)

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to a correction.  However, the positive PPO and strong recent relative strength indicate continued short-term upward momentum.  The current price ($41.73) significantly exceeds the moving averages suggesting a recent and rapid price increase (possibly a sharp upward movement).  The 0% expected return against the S&P 500 needs further external analysis to provide a more realistic value.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates significantly, with a high of $12.58B in Q2 2024 and lows around $6.56B-$7.27B in other quarters. No clear consistent trend is discernible.
* **EPS:** Shows extremely high volatility, ranging from a loss of -$6.02 to a profit of $2.83.  There's no consistent pattern, making it difficult to predict future earnings based on this limited data.

The inconsistent financial performance makes it difficult to establish reliable trends or compare individual quarters effectively.  More historical data would be needed for a comprehensive assessment.  There is no information provided to assess whether the reported numbers beat or missed expectations.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable around $0.07-$0.09B.  Profit margins are consistently high (56%-59%), indicating strong profitability despite low revenue.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable around $0.87B-$0.93B. Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, ranging from -6.90% to -8.35%. This suggests the company is not generating sufficient returns on invested capital.

The combination of high profit margins and consistently negative ROE warrants further investigation into the company's capital structure and investment strategies.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or market outlook is provided. Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also absent from the provided information.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai shows significant short-term upward momentum indicated by price action and technical indicators. However, the long-term outlook is uncertain due to inconsistent financial performance, negative ROE, and a lack of information regarding market expectations and analyst sentiment.  The high RSI suggests a potential for a short-term correction.  The high volatility in both revenue and EPS presents a significant risk.  Further analysis incorporating external market data and more historical financial information is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The provided 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further context.  The provided data alone paints a picture of a highly volatile and potentially risky investment.
