## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Report

This report analyzes C3.ai Inc., a provider of enterprise AI software, based on the provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

C3.ai's cumulative return (14.12%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 65.12%.  The difference is -51.0%, placing it at the 24th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-89.3% to 70.0%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows highly volatile performance and inconsistent results across different periods:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                      |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2020-2022  | -96.0% | 25.9% | -86.0% | 0.0 | 1.4 | Extremely negative performance, low beta     |
| 2021-2023  | -24.0% | 45.4% | -48.0% | 0.0 | 3.7 | Still negative performance, increasing beta |
| 2022-2024  | 82.0% | 45.4% | 49.0% | 0.0 | 4.4 | Significant positive performance              |
| 2023-2025  | 42.0% | 45.4% | -20.0% | 0.1 | 4.1 | Positive but less dramatic than previous year |


The high volatility and near-zero alpha suggest that C3.ai's returns are largely driven by market movements (high Beta in some years), rather than company-specific factors.  The inconsistent CAGR across periods highlights significant risk.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $31.56
* **Previous Close:** $32.91
* **5-day Moving Average:** $32.81
* **20-day Moving Average:** $32.74
* **60-day Moving Average:** $35.03

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend. The recent price drop of -$4.10 (-12.46%) signals a significant negative development.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.39 (Slightly above neutral; not strongly overbought or oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.09 (Positive, suggesting some upward momentum)
* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** -6.5% (Short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -103.2% (Significantly negative compared to S&P 500; indicating significant underperformance expected if the S&P 500 maintains its current trends)

The combination of a slightly positive PPO and a negative relative strength change suggests mixed signals. The extremely negative expected return highlights considerable risk.  The recent price drop significantly contributes to this outlook.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue     | Notes                                           |
|------------|---------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 2024-11-07 | $0.72   | $6.75B      |                                                 |
| 2024-08-01 | -$6.02  | $6.56B      | Significant loss                                 |
| 2024-05-02 | $1.75   | $6.76B      |                                                 |
| 2023-11-02 | $2.83   | $7.27B      |                                                 |
| 2024-11-07 | $2.83   | $7.27B      | Duplicate entry; likely an error in the data.   |

Earnings are inconsistent, with significant fluctuations in EPS.  The large loss in Q1 2025 is a major concern.  Data needs clarification as it contains a duplicate entry.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue is relatively stable around $0.09B, with a consistent high profit margin.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin | Notes                               |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.09B | 61.31%       |                                       |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.09B | 59.81%       |                                       |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.09B | 59.60%       |                                       |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.08B | 57.76%       |                                       |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.07B | 56.14%       |                                       |

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable, but ROE is consistently negative.

| Quarter | Equity | ROE    | Notes                        |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------------------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.86B | -7.68% |                               |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B | -7.18% |                               |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.87B | -8.35% |                               |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.90B | -8.09% |                               |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.91B | -7.66% |                               |


The negative ROE is a serious concern, suggesting the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai shows significant volatility and underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While the profit margins are high, the negative ROE and inconsistent earnings, coupled with a significantly negative long-term expected return, raise serious concerns about the investment's viability.  The recent large price drop further emphasizes the significant risk involved.  Further investigation is required to understand the reasons behind the substantial loss in Q1 2025 and to verify the duplicated data entry.  Given the current data,  a long-term investment in C3.ai appears very risky.
