|------------|----------|---------|---------|-------|--------|

*   **CAGR:** Highly volatile, swinging from negative to positive.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown, indicating significant price volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Mixed, with periods of both significant underperformance and outperformance relative to the market. Recent alpha is heavily negative.
*   **Beta:**  Close to zero or negative, suggesting low correlation with the S&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap has fluctuated.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 17.865
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 17.8505
    *   Previous Close: 18.1
    *   Change: -1.38%
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day: 17.917
    *   20-day: 18.4243
    *   60-day: 17.9426

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, but significantly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a recent downtrend.  The negative change of -1.38% from the previous close reinforces this.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Hybrid Signal**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - While the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, this might be based on factors beyond pure price momentum and could conflict with other indicators.
*   **RSI:** 42.06 (Neutral, neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.3877 (Slightly negative, indicating a potential downtrend)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (57 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.7% of total investment ($1,000.00)" - This suggests a strong buy signal based on the algorithm, allocating 100% of available cash and recommending a recurring monthly investment.
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -4.0 (Negative, Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -379.0 (This is a *very* negative expected return, suggesting significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term *if* the model is accurate. This is a major red flag.)

The negative change in divergence reinforces the downtrend indicated by the moving averages. The hybrid signal is contradicting, as are the expected returns and MRIs.
