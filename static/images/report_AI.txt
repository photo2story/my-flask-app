## C3.ai Inc (AI) Stock Report

This report analyzes C3.ai Inc (AI), a provider of enterprise AI software.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

C3.ai's cumulative return of 15.64% significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 63.53%, resulting in a return difference of -47.9%.  This places C3.ai at the 26th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance:

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |  Notes                                      |
|------------|---------|-------|-------|------|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| 2020-2022  | -96.0%  | 25.9% | -86.0% | 0.0  | 1.4    | Extremely poor performance, significant negative alpha. |
| 2021-2023  | -24.0%  | 45.4% | -48.0% | 0.0  | 3.7    | Continued underperformance, negative alpha.    |
| 2022-2024  | 82.0%   | 45.4% | 49.0% | 0.0  | 4.4    | Strong recovery, positive alpha.              |
| 2023-2025  | 44.0%   | 45.4% | -17.0% | 0.1  | 4.1    | Moderate performance, slightly negative alpha.|


The high volatility (MDD) and fluctuating alpha highlight significant risk and inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta near 0 indicates relatively low correlation with the market in recent years).

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $31.98
* **Last Day Change:** -$3.11 (-8.86%) - a significant daily drop
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $33.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $32.64
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $34.74

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent significant price drop warrants further investigation.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.9 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to oversold territory.
* **PPO:** 0.67 – A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, although it's relatively low.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -4.9% – Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.

The significant negative price change (-8.86%) reflects a considerable market event. The expected return of -93% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is extremely negative, highlighting substantial risk.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue:

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       | Notes                                               |
|------------|---------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 2024-11-07 | $0.72   | $6.75B        |                                                       |
| 2024-08-01 | -$6.02  | $6.56B        | Significant loss                                      |
| 2024-05-02 | $1.75   | $12.58B       | High revenue quarter                                  |
| 2023-11-02 | $2.83   | $7.27B        |                                                       |
| 2024-11-07 | $2.83   | $7.27B        | Duplicate entry (likely an error in the provided data) |

Revenue fluctuates significantly; EPS shows large swings between profitability and substantial losses. This inconsistency warrants closer examination of the company's financial health and business model.

**5) Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals a concerning trend:

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue remains relatively flat, while profit margins are high but show a slight downward trend.


**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity is relatively stable, but ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai shows inconsistent financial performance, significant underperformance against the S&P 500, and high volatility. While there have been periods of strong growth, the overall picture reveals considerable risk.  The negative ROE, fluctuating earnings, and consistently negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 raise serious concerns about the company's long-term viability.  Further investigation into the reasons for the volatile earnings and the company's long-term strategy is crucial before any investment decision.  The recent significant price drop underscores the inherent risk associated with this stock.  Given the data, a cautious approach is advised.  Independent verification of the provided data is strongly recommended.
