**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (C3.ai):** -16.76%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO/S&P 500):** 48.26%
* **Return Difference:** -65.0% (C3.ai underperformed VOO by 65 percentage points).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance and high beta, indicating significant market sensitivity:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -62.0% | 30.6% | -52.0% | 1.5 |
| 2021-2023  | -10.0% | 41.2% | -33.0% | 3.8 |
| 2022-2024  | 71.0% | 41.2% | 39.0% | 4.6 |
| 2023-2025  | 17.0% | 41.2% | -29.0% | 3.0 |

High Beta values suggest significant price volatility, mirroring market movements.  Negative Alphas in most periods demonstrate underperformance relative to the market benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $22.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $22.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $22.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $29.69

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.07 (1.07%) from the previous close is relatively small compared to the long-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 53.63 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 1.36 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.1 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -158.9% (This indicates a substantial projected underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, reflecting high risk).  This extremely negative value underscores significant investment caution.  The recent price change is not significant enough to change the long-term outlook dramatically.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue        |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| 2024-11-07 | $0.72  | $6.75B          |
| 2024-08-01 | -$6.02 | $6.56B          |
| 2024-05-02 | $1.75  | $6.76B          |
| 2023-11-02 | $2.83  | $7.27B          |
| 2024-11-07 | $2.83  | $7.27B          |


Earnings are highly volatile, with significant swings between positive and negative EPS. Revenue remains relatively stable, but the inconsistency in profitability raises serious concerns.  The duplicate entry for 2024-11-07 needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-01-31 | $0.10B | 59.07% |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.09B | 61.31% |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.09B | 59.81% |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.09B | 59.60% |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.08B | 57.76% |

High profit margins are reported despite relatively low revenue.  This requires further investigation to understand the underlying factors contributing to this seemingly contradictory picture.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE     |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 2025-01-31 | $0.86B | -9.32%  |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.86B | -7.68%  |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B | -7.18%  |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.87B | -8.35%  |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.90B | -8.09%  |

Negative ROE consistently indicates that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity. This is a significant concern regarding long-term sustainability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai exhibits high risk.  While the profit margins appear healthy, the negative ROE, volatile earnings, and significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 paint a concerning picture. The high beta indicates considerable market sensitivity, amplifying both gains and losses.  The projected long-term underperformance (-158.9%) suggests extremely high risk associated with long-term investment.  Further investigation into the causes of volatile earnings and negative ROE, as well as a clearer understanding of the company's future growth strategy, is crucial before considering any investment.  The current data strongly suggests caution is warranted.  Independent research and professional financial advice are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
