This report analyzes C3.ai Inc. (AI), a provider of enterprise AI software, based on the provided data.  Note that this analysis is limited to the data provided and may not reflect a complete picture of the company's financial health and prospects.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

C3.ai's cumulative return (47.46%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (65.59%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -18.1%, placing it at the 44.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **5-day Moving Average:** $37.71
* **20-day Moving Average:** $33.19
* **60-day Moving Average:** $27.66

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average indicates a potential recent rapid price increase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (84.74):**  The RSI is significantly above 70, indicating the stock is in overbought territory. This suggests a potential correction could be imminent.
* **PPO (0.84):** A positive PPO value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+6.5):** This indicates a recent increase in relative strength compared to the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided expected return of 0% suggests that, based on the provided data, there is no expected outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) at this current juncture.

Given the current price of $40.52 is significantly above its moving averages, coupled with the overbought RSI, there's a notable risk of a price correction or a period of consolidation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both revenue and EPS.  While revenue generally shows increase, EPS is highly volatile, swinging from substantial positive earnings in some quarters to significant negative earnings in others.  There is no consistent trend and no information about analyst expectations for comparison.

* **Revenue:**  While revenue generally shows growth, there is significant fluctuation between quarters making it difficult to establish a clear trend.
* **EPS:** Extreme volatility.  Large positive and negative EPS figures are evident with no discernible pattern.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue growth is slow and relatively flat while profit margin remains strong and relatively consistent.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable, but ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  This is a significant concern.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent market outlook and analyst opinions were provided.  This significantly limits the analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai exhibits substantial volatility. While recent price action shows a sharp increase and positive momentum indicators, the overbought RSI and negative ROE raise concerns about sustainability. The lack of consistent earnings and the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 create uncertainty.  Furthermore, the absence of recent news and analyst opinions hampers a comprehensive assessment.  The high volatility combined with lack of consistent profitability makes this a high-risk investment.   Further investigation is required before forming a strong investment opinion.  More data, particularly analyst expectations and recent news, are crucial for a more thorough evaluation.
