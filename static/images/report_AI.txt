2024-12-05 - Analysis Report
## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  The cumulative return of C3.ai (18.12%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (68.11%) over the measured period.  The difference is -50.0%, placing it at the 36.1st percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta data show significant volatility and inconsistency in performance across different time periods. While the most recent period (2022-2024) shows a strong positive return (82%), prior periods show substantial losses.  The near-zero alpha suggests the stock's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta of approximately 1.0 to 5.0 across periods).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $36.75 (Last Market: $37.91)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $36.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $31.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $26.83

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, though the relatively high RSI (see below) might suggest the stock is overbought.  The recent jump from $36.75 to $37.91 could be considered a minor upward spike, though more data is needed to confirm a sustained trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.91 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.29 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** NaN (-) indicating a recent short-term decline.  Given the price jump to $37.91, this could represent a temporary dip within an otherwise upward trend.  However, more data is needed to confirm this.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This indicates that based on the provided data, no significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is expected over the long term (2+ years) with a buy-and-hold strategy, assuming constant conditions.)

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While the latest quarter (2024-11-07) shows a positive EPS of $0.72 and revenue of $6.75B, this follows a negative EPS of -$6.02 in the previous quarter (2024-08-01).  Revenue also fluctuates considerably across quarters.  Without further context (such as analyst expectations), it's impossible to definitively assess whether these results are "beats" or "misses".  There is also a duplication of the 2024-11-07 data point in the provided table.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has shown a slight upward trend, though it remains relatively stable within a narrow range.  Profit margins are consistently high (56-60%), suggesting strong profitability despite revenue fluctuations.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable.  Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital.  This is a significant concern and needs further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News:**  The provided earnings data is the most recent news available within the scope of the provided data.
* **Recent Market Outlook:** No market outlook is provided.
* **Analyst Opinions:** No analyst opinions are included.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai shows significant volatility and inconsistency in its performance. While recent quarters show some positive signs (high profit margins, upward price movement), the negative ROE, substantial fluctuations in earnings, and significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 raise serious concerns.  The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought in the short-term.  More data, particularly analyst expectations and a broader market outlook, is needed for a comprehensive assessment.  The provided data alone does not support a strong buy recommendation, especially given the negative ROE.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative ROE and the volatility in earnings is crucial before making any investment decisions.
