**0) Simple Numbers & Initial Observations:**

*   C3.ai (AI) Cumulative Return: -42.64%
*   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 49.50%
*   AI Stock Price: $14.44
*   5-day SMA: 14.28
*   20-day SMA: 14.70
*   60-day SMA: 16.24
*   RSI: 50.81
*   PPO: -0.17
*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   Analyst Consensus: Hold (Mean Rating: 3.43)
*   Target Price (Average): $14.67

**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** C3.ai is an enterprise AI software company.
*   **Return Rate Comparison:** C3.ai has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). The divergence in cumulative returns is -92.1%, indicating substantial underperformance. The relative divergence is 1.1, meaning it's near the minimum of its historical range.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

    *   **2020-2022:** Significant negative CAGR (-64.0%) and Alpha (-40.0%) indicating poor performance relative to the market, with high volatility (MDD 77.9%). The negative Beta (-0.1) shows an inverse correlation with the market during this period.
    *   **2021-2023:** Slight positive CAGR (6.0%) and Alpha (5.0%), but still high volatility (MDD 82.8%). The nearly zero Beta indicates very little market correlation.
    *   **2022-2024:** Strong positive CAGR (59.0%) and Alpha (39.0%), but MDD remains high (82.8%). The Beta of 0 suggests it moved independently of the S&P 500.
    *   **2023-2025:** Negative CAGR (-5.0%) and significantly negative Alpha (-71.0%), indicating a large drop in performance. Again, high volatility (MDD 82.8%). Beta is almost zero.

    *   **Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta analysis paints a volatile picture. C3.ai's performance has been highly inconsistent, with periods of strong outperformance and significant underperformance. The consistently high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) points to substantial risk.  The low Beta values suggest the stock's movement is not strongly correlated with the overall market, making it a more idiosyncratic investment.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Current Price: $14.44
*   Last Market Close: $14.04 (Change: +0.14 from previous close)
*   5-day SMA: 14.28
*   20-day SMA: 14.70
*   60-day SMA: 16.24

*   **Analysis:** The price is currently above the 5-day SMA but below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a potential short-term upward trend, but the longer-term trend (60-day) is still downward. The most recent market close shows a slight increase, potentially indicating a small rebound.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, Expected Return Analysis**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 50.81 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   PPO: -0.17 (Slightly bearish, indicating short-term weakness)
*   Hybrid Signal: Buy 100% of cash (69 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90).
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = -2.3 (Short-term decline)
*   Expected Return (%): -1418.0% (Extremely negative, suggesting significant long-term underperformance)

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.  The RSI is neutral. The negative PPO suggests short-term downward momentum. However, the Hybrid Signal recommends using all cash to buy, indicating a potentially favorable entry point based on its algorithm (MRI of 0.90, suggesting high safety based on its metrics).  The recent divergence change confirms a short-term decline. The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting very poor long-term prospects compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Price Fluctuation Consideration:** The change of +0.14 in the last market price indicates a small rebound.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes:** The news headlines paint a mixed picture. Some articles predict AI stocks will be big winners, while others are more cautious, highlighting debt risks and potential underperformance. There is specific discussion about Palantir vs. Oracle and lists of best AI stocks. The MarketBeat article suggests a stock is selling in Datavault AI, signaling the importance of monitoring company announcements to compare.

*   **Interpretation:** The news suggests that while there is still optimism surrounding AI, a selective approach is warranted. Investors are becoming more discerning and focusing on companies with strong fundamentals and less debt.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   Consensus: Hold (3.43)
*   Target Price: $14.67 (Average)
*   High Target: $24.00
*   Low Target: $8.00

*   **Analysis:** The "Hold" consensus indicates that analysts are generally neutral on the stock. The average target price of $14.67 is only slightly above the current price, suggesting limited upside potential. The wide range between the high and low target prices ($8 to $24) reflects significant uncertainty and disagreement among analysts. The missing Recent Rating Changes provide no current indication of analyst updates.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Based on the provided data, C3.ai (AI) appears to be a risky investment. Key takeaways:

*   **Underperformance:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** High historical volatility (MDD).
*   **Inconsistent Performance:** Fluctuating financial performance, with some quarters showing revenue decline and negative ROE.
*   **Mixed News Sentiment:** News is mixed, with some optimism surrounding AI generally, but caution advised regarding specific companies.
*   **Neutral Analyst Opinion:** Analysts are generally neutral, with limited upside potential suggested by the target price.
*   **Concerning Financials:** Negative ROE and decreasing equity are worrying.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-1418%) is a very significant concern, suggesting very poor long-term prospects relative to the S&P 500.

**Recommendation:**

Due to the underperformance, high volatility, negative ROE, and extremely negative expected return, a cautious approach is warranted. The "Hold" consensus and the positive Hybrid Signal offer some conflicting signals, but the fundamental financial concerns and extremely negative expected return outweigh these. Further due diligence, including a deeper dive into the company's financials and competitive landscape, is strongly advised before considering an investment. Additionally, it is important to clarify the EPS and Revenue reports.
