**0) Report Introduction**

This report analyzes the current state of C3.ai Inc (AI) stock, comparing its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) and considering various financial indicators, analyst opinions, recent news, and earnings data.

**1) Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **Company Overview:** C3.ai Inc is an enterprise AI software provider.

    *   AI Cumulative Return: -42.44%
    *   VOO Cumulative Return: 48.42%
    *   Divergence: -88.1 (Relative Divergence: 3.7)

*   **Analysis:** C3.ai has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a very large negative divergence in cumulative return. The relative divergence being low (3.7) means the divergence is near its worst historically within the observed period.

*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -64.0% | 77.9% | -40.0% | -0.1 | 1.6    |
| 2021-2023  | 6.0%  | 82.8% | 5.0%   | -0.0 | 4.0    |

| 2023-2025  | -5.0% | 82.8% | -69.0% | 0.0  | 2.0    |

*   **Analysis of Alpha/Beta:**
    *   **CAGR:** The CAGR fluctuates significantly, showing periods of strong growth (2022-2024) and significant decline (2020-2022).
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
    *   **Alpha:**  Alpha varies greatly, with negative values indicating underperformance relative to the market (S&P 500). A negative Alpha suggests the stock's returns are not justifying the risk taken.  The period 2023-2025 shows a particularly bad underperformance with -69% Alpha.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is close to zero, suggesting the stock has a very low correlation with the broader market.  This means C3.ai's price movements are largely independent of overall market trends.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Cap varies from 1.6B to 4.8B.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close: 14.49
*   Last-market Change: -1.09%
*   5-day SMA: 15.23
*   20-day SMA: 14.59
*   60-day SMA: 16.42

*   **Analysis:** The stock is trading below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, but near its 20-day moving average. This suggests a recent downward trend, but it may be stabilizing around the 20-day SMA. The negative change of -1.09% on the last market day reinforces this downward pressure.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Hybrid Signal Analysis**

*   MRI: 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 53.92
*   PPO: 0.76
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (69 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: 1.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   Expected Return (%): -397.2%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** The MRI of 0.7 indicates a medium level of investment risk, suggesting some caution is warranted.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 53.92 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:** A PPO of 0.76 suggests that the short-term moving average is slightly above the long-term moving average, indicating a slight upward trend, but the value is low.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests buying, categorizing it as "Very Safe" with a high MRI (0.90). This seems contradictory to other indicators and news. Note: Algorithm signals can be wrong and depend on the algorithm's internal logic.
    *   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term positive trend, which contrasts with the long-term underperformance.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-397.2%) is a significant red flag. It suggests that, based on current conditions, a long-term investment in AI is projected to result in a very substantial loss compared to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Key Themes from News:** Recent news presents a mixed picture:
    *   **Caution/Sell Recommendations:** Some articles suggest selling AI due to steep pullbacks and viewing other AI stocks as ones to sell before 2026.
    *   **Contradictory Views:** Another article predicts AI will have the largest market cap in the world by 2026.
    *   **Analyst Upgrades:** Another article highlights Cowen calls to AMZN and AMD as the best ideas for 2026.
    *   **Market Pressure:** One article indicates that AI stocks are under pressure.

*   **Impact:** The news sentiment appears bearish to neutral overall. The presence of "sell" recommendations and articles highlighting market pressure suggests increased risk and investor uncertainty.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 3.43)
*   **Target Price:** Average: $14.67, High: $24.00, Low: $8.00

*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting that analysts, on average, are not recommending buying or selling the stock at this time. The wide range between the high and low target prices ($8.00 to $24.00) indicates significant disagreement among analysts regarding the stock's future potential. The average target price ($14.67) is slightly above the current price, suggesting a small potential upside.
