2024-12-04 - Analysis Report
## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  The cumulative return of C3.ai (18.12%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (68.11%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -49.99%.  The relative divergence of -50.0 indicates that C3.ai's performance is in the lower 36.1% percentile relative to the S&P 500's performance over the historical data range.  The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility, ranging from -82% to 82% depending on the period analyzed.  The consistently low or negative Alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market, while Beta near 1.0 implies similar volatility to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $36.75
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $36.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $31.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $26.83

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The relatively large gap between the 20-day and 60-day moving averages further supports this. The closing price of 36.73 is not significantly different from the closing price of 36.75, so no significant, sudden price movement is observed.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.91 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 1.29 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** NaN (Insufficient data to interpret)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This value needs further clarification and context.  A 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) suggests the model doesn't anticipate significant outperformance.  More data and model specifics are needed for meaningful interpretation)

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought, potentially signaling a short-term correction.  The positive PPO supports the upward momentum but should be interpreted in conjunction with the RSI. The missing data on relative divergence change prevents a complete short-term trend analysis.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally shows an increasing trend (with the exception of a dip in Q1 2024), EPS has fluctuated wildly, including large negative values.  Notably, Q4 2024 EPS increased significantly compared to Q3 2024. Comparing Q4 2024 with Q4 2023 reveals EPS remained consistent, while revenue increased, indicating a likely improved profit margin.  Without access to expected earnings,  no "beats" or "misses" can be identified.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue shows modest quarter-over-quarter growth, although the numbers are relatively small. Profit margin is consistently high, but the Equity and ROE are concerning. The negative ROE indicates the company is not generating a return on its equity investment.  The relatively stable equity suggests that despite the negative ROE, the company's equity position isn't rapidly deteriorating.  Further analysis is required to understand the causes for the negative ROE.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai exhibits high growth potential based on the upward trend in revenues and profit margins. However, the negative ROE and significant EPS volatility are major concerns.  The stock's performance lags the S&P 500, and technical indicators suggest potential short-term overbought conditions.  More information is needed on recent news, analyst opinions, and the model's methodology for the 0% expected return to provide a more complete and accurate assessment. The current financial data warrants a cautious approach, demanding a thorough investigation into the reasons behind the negative ROE and EPS fluctuations before making any investment decisions.
