Okay, let's break down the provided information on C3.ai Inc. (AI) and provide a comprehensive analysis.

**0) Report Structure**

I will provide the data, followed by a simple analysis of each section. Finally, I'll summarize the overall picture in a comprehensive analysis.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (AI vs. VOO)**

*   **C3.ai Inc. (AI) Overview:** C3.ai is an enterprise AI software company.
*   **AI Cumulative Return:** -45.10%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 50.83%
*   **Divergence:** -95.9 (Relative Divergence: 0.3)

**Analysis:**

*   AI has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period.
*   The divergence of -95.9 indicates a substantial difference in returns.
*   A Relative Divergence of 0.3 suggests this divergence is near the lowest end of its historical range, meaning the underperformance is relatively extreme compared to its own past performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year      | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
| --------- | ------- | ----- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| 2024-2026 | -43.0% | 82.8% | -90.0% | -0.1 | 1.9    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** A negative CAGR of -43.0% shows significant value erosion over the period.
*   **MDD:** A high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) of 82.8% indicates very high volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** A negative Alpha of -90.0% means the stock has underperformed its benchmark (presumably the S&P 500) even after accounting for market risk.
*   **Beta:** A Beta of -0.1 suggests a slightly inverse correlation with the market. This is unusual and could indicate the stock is moving independently of broader market trends or is highly influenced by company-specific factors.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization of $1.9 billion.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 13.82
*   **Last Market Data:** Price = 13.52, Previous Close = 13.82, Change = -2.21%
*   **5-day SMA:** 13.96
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.70
*   **60-day SMA:** 15.87

**Analysis:**

*   The stock price is currently below all three SMAs (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This suggests a downtrend.
*   The last market data shows a negative change of -2.21%, indicating continued downward pressure.

**3) Index Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 23.37
*   **PPO:** -0.36
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (69 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -0.8 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -1608.0%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the negative performance, the MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended." This could be due to the algorithm's consideration of factors beyond just recent price movement, such as perceived long-term potential.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 23.37 indicates that the stock is significantly oversold, suggesting a potential for a rebound.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO of -0.36 indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends aggressive buying, further emphasizing a potentially contrarian view.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:**  Confirms the recent price decline compared to its historical divergence patterns with the market.
*   **Expected Return:** The "Expected Return" of -1608.0% is an extreme figure, which is a potential error or a reflection of very high uncertainty. This number should be treated with extreme caution.  It likely represents a projection based on current trends and shouldn't be taken literally.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance)**

*   **Key Themes:**
    *   Analyst outlook for AI stocks in 2026
    *   Billionaire holdings in AI stocks
    *   Potential for AI stocks to outperform NVIDIA
    *   Prediction of an AI stock becoming a $2 trillion company.

**Analysis:**

The news headlines present a mixed picture. There is optimism surrounding the AI sector in general, with analysts and investors highlighting potential winners in 2026. However, whether C3.ai specifically benefits from this broader trend is unclear. The news does suggest that there is considerable interest and speculation surrounding AI stocks, which could create opportunities for volatility and potential gains, but also significant risk.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** No clear consensus (indicated by "-")
*   **Opinions:** 12
*   **Target Price:** Average = 14.67, High = 24.00, Low = 8.00

**Analysis:**

The analyst opinions are mixed. The wide range between the high and low target prices (8.00 to 24.00) reflects considerable uncertainty about the stock's future. The average target price (14.67) is slightly above the current price, suggesting a modest potential upside according to analysts, but the low target indicates significant downside risk is also considered.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue    |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------- |
| 2025-11-05 | 0.94 | 6.35 B$  |
| 2025-08-07 | 2    | 7.09 B$  |
| 2025-05-02 | 1.18 | 6.78 B$  |
| 2024-11-07 | 0.72 | 6.75 B$  |
| 2025-11-05 | 0.72 | 6.75 B$  |

**Analysis:**

*   The provided data shows variations in both EPS (Earnings Per Share) and revenue.
*   There's no clear upward or downward trend in either metric based on this limited data. More historical data is needed to assess the long-term earnings performance. It seems there is a duplicate of the 2024-11-07 numbers at the end, likely in error.
*   The large EPS values are quite suspicious given the negative performance of the stock. It is likely the EPS values are incorrect.

*   **Equity:** Equity is decreasing over the observed period.
*   **ROE:** Negative ROE (Return on Equity) values indicate that the company is not generating profits relative to its equity. The declining equity combined with negative ROE is a cause for concern.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

C3.ai Inc. (AI) presents a complex and risky investment profile:

*   **Negative Performance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative divergence. The negative CAGR and high MDD further emphasize the poor historical performance and high volatility.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The stock is in a downtrend, trading below its moving averages. The oversold RSI suggests a potential for a short-term rebound, but the negative PPO confirms the overall downtrend.
*   **Conflicting Signals:** The MRI suggests a "High Investment Recommended," which contradicts the negative performance and analyst target price. This could be due to a long-term algorithm or a focus on potential future growth. The Hybrid Signal also suggests aggressive buying.
*   **Mixed Analyst Opinions:** Analyst opinions are mixed, with a wide range of target prices reflecting uncertainty.
*   **Financial Concerns:** While profit margins are high, the negative ROE and decreasing equity are concerning.
*   **News Sentiment:** The news is generally positive about the AI sector, but it's unclear if C3.ai will be a direct beneficiary.
*   **Earnings Data:** The EPS values are suspiciously high. The other data shows revenue that is somewhat variable.
*   **Dubious Values:** The hybrid signal, MRI and Expected Return are all numbers that would not be present at the same time. Additionally, the earnings numbers are inaccurate. It is likely that the numbers are unreliable.

**Conclusion:**

Investing in C3.ai is highly speculative. The stock exhibits concerning financial trends. The positive indicators (MRI, Hybrid Signal, news sentiment) should be viewed with caution given the negative performance. It is possible that the stock presents a contrarian buying opportunity if the investor believes in the company's long-term potential and is willing to accept a high degree of risk. However, a more cautious approach would involve waiting for more consistent financial performance and a clearer positive trend before considering an investment.
