## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  The cumulative return for C3.ai is 17.27%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 67.22%.  The difference is -50.0%, placing it at the 36.1 percentile of the historical range of divergence between C3.ai and the S&P 500 (-99.5% to 37.5%).  This indicates substantial underperformance relative to the broader market. The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows consistently high Beta values (1.4 to 4.5), suggesting high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The negative CAGR values over the periods 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 highlight substantial losses. While 2022-2024 shows a positive CAGR, it's important to consider the high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) which indicates significant risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $36.39
* **5-day Moving Average:** $36.60
* **20-day Moving Average:** $29.72
* **60-day Moving Average:** $26.06

The price is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, the 5-day moving average being slightly higher implies a potential short-term pullback.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.39 (Overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.81 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +20.1% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0%  (This is a crucial piece of information that is missing.  A proper assessment requires a more detailed financial model and future projections.)

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and prone to a correction. The positive PPO confirms the short-term upward trend, but the overbought RSI signals caution.  The provided expected return of 0% needs further clarification and justification.  A 0% expected return over the long term implies no outperformance versus the S&P 500, contrasting with the goal of analyzing potential long-term outperformance.  The price of $36.4 is relatively close to the 5-day moving average and is not indicating a rapid surge or drastic decline currently.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicates.  A clear and consistent dataset is needed for accurate analysis.  Crucially, we lack information regarding earnings expectations and actual earnings surprises, hindering a full assessment of the company's recent performance.

**6. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  The revenue has remained relatively stable over the quarters, while profit margins have fluctuated but generally shown a positive trend.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Negative ROE (Return on Equity) across all reported quarters is extremely concerning, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity investment.

**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **(Missing):**  The report needs to incorporate recent news, analyst opinions, and market outlooks from sources like Shacknews and Finbold to provide a comprehensive assessment of current sentiment.  This is crucial to complete the analysis.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the past few years, despite recent positive price movement.  While short-term indicators show some bullish momentum, the high RSI suggests potential overvaluation.  The consistently negative ROE is a serious concern, indicating that the company isn't efficiently utilizing its resources to generate profits.  The absence of earnings expectations, complete and consistent financial data, and recent news analysis prevents a conclusive assessment of the stock's future prospects.  Further investigation into the inconsistencies in the provided data and the inclusion of missing information (especially concerning long-term expected return and recent news) are critical before forming any investment decisions.
