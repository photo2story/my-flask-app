## C3.ai Inc (AI) Stock Report

This report analyzes C3.ai Inc. (AI), a provider of enterprise AI software, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

C3.ai's cumulative return (12.21%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (55.75%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -43.5%, placing it at the 28.8th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500's range of -89.3% to 70%. This indicates that while C3.ai has shown some positive returns, its performance has lagged significantly behind the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent Alpha and Beta values, ranging from 0.0 to 4.0 for Beta.  Further investigation is needed to interpret this properly.  The high Beta values (4.0) in some periods suggest that the stock's price is highly sensitive to market movements, indicating higher risk.  The negative CAGR values in some periods highlight periods of significant underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $30.96
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $33.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $36.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $32.56

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (35.02):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce. However, this should be interpreted cautiously.
* **PPO (-2.35):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -10.7%, indicating a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (-83.7%):** This exceptionally low projected return relative to the S&P 500 indicates significant downside risk, especially over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years). This prediction needs further context and justification. The current price ($30.96) doesn't trigger any immediate notes of extreme volatility like a sudden surge or drop;  however, the other indicators strongly suggest a bearish outlook.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data is inconsistent and volatile.  There are significant variations in EPS and revenue figures.  Revenue appears to fluctuate considerably quarter-to-quarter and EPS shows both significant positive and negative values.  This inconsistency warrants further analysis to understand the underlying reasons for these fluctuations.  The duplicated entry for 2024-11-07 needs clarification.


| Date       | EPS   | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 0.72  | 6.75         |
| 2024-08-01 | -6.02 | 6.56         |
| 2024-05-02 | 1.75  | 12.58        |
| 2023-11-02 | 2.83  | 7.27         |
| 2024-11-07 | 2.83  | 7.27         |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information reveals consistently high profit margins but negative Return on Equity (ROE). This suggests that while the company is profitable on a per-sale basis, it may not be effectively utilizing its equity to generate returns for shareholders.  The relatively stable revenue figures at approximately $0.09B also need further explanation concerning the inconsistent EPS and the wide revenue swing between Q2 2024 and Q1 2024.


| Quarter    | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-10-31 | 0.09         | 61.31%        | 0.86        | -7.68   |
| 2024-07-31 | 0.09         | 59.81%        | 0.87        | -7.18   |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.09         | 59.60%        | 0.87        | -8.35   |
| 2024-01-31 | 0.08         | 57.76%        | 0.90        | -8.09   |
| 2023-10-31 | 0.07         | 56.14%        | 0.91        | -7.66   |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai exhibits a volatile performance history. While possessing high profit margins, its negative ROE, inconsistent earnings, and significant underperformance against the S&P 500 raise serious concerns. The technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook appears bearish given the predicted negative return against the market benchmark. Further investigation into the reasons behind the inconsistent earnings and the negative ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions. The data provided is insufficient to make a firm recommendation.  More robust financial modeling and fundamental analysis are necessary.  Consider consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment choices.
