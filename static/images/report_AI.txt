## C3.ai Inc (AI) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  The cumulative return of C3.ai (11.99%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) (56.02%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -44.0%, placing it at the 28.4th percentile of its historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values show inconsistencies across different periods. While beta consistently shows a high volatility (above 1, especially 4.0 in some periods), indicating higher sensitivity to market movements than the average stock, the alpha values are consistently 0.  This suggests the stock's returns are primarily driven by market movements, with no significant outperformance (positive alpha) or underperformance (negative alpha) beyond market fluctuations.  The significant CAGR variations highlight the high volatility of this stock.  The maximum drawdown (MDD) is substantial, reflecting periods of significant price decline.

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -96.0%  | 25.9%   | -86.0% | 0.0   | 1.0     |
| 2021-2023  | -24.0%  | 45.4%   | -48.0% | 0.0   | 4.0     |
| 2022-2024  | 82.0%   | 45.4%   | 49.0%  | 0.0   | 4.0     |
| 2023-2025  | 40.0%   | 45.4%   | -13.0% | 0.0   | 4.0     |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $30.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $32.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $36.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $32.63

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (30.79):** Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-2.48):** Shows a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -10.6%, indicating a recent downward trend.
* **Expected Return (-85.2%):**  This extremely negative expected return, especially when compared to the S&P 500, signals a significantly high risk.  The projection of a long-term (2+ years) negative return highlights the substantial underperformance against the market benchmark.  This warrants further investigation to understand the rationale behind this prediction.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility and inconsistency.  There is no clear trend, with both positive and negative EPS values observed over recent quarters. Revenue figures also fluctuate considerably.  The data alone doesn't provide a clear picture of the company's financial health, and further investigation is necessary.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 0.72   | $6.75B       |
| 2024-08-01 | -6.02  | $6.56B       |
| 2024-05-02 | 1.75   | $12.58B      |
| 2023-11-02 | 2.83   | $7.27B       |
| 2024-11-07 | 2.83   | $7.27B       | *(Duplicate entry likely a data error)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable in recent quarters, hovering around $0.09B. Profit margins are consistently high (above 55%), suggesting efficient operations. However, the negative Return on Equity (ROE) across all quarters is concerning and indicates the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.  This should be investigated further.

| Quarter    | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.09B   | 61.31%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.09B   | 59.81%        |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.09B   | 59.60%        |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.08B   | 57.76%        |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.07B   | 56.14%        |

| Quarter    | Equity   | ROE     |
|------------|----------|---------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.86B   | -7.68%  |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B   | -7.18%  |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.87B   | -8.35%  |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.90B   | -8.09%  |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.91B   | -7.66%  |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai shows significant volatility and underperformance against the S&P 500.  While high profit margins are positive, the negative ROE and inconsistent earnings are major concerns. The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  The extremely negative projected long-term return raises serious doubts about the stock's investment viability.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the negative expected return and the inconsistent financial performance before making any investment decisions.  The oversold RSI may suggest a short-term bounce, but the overall picture remains bearish.  Thorough due diligence, including an analysis of the company's long-term strategy and competitive landscape, is crucial.  The data provided contains inconsistencies and requires further clarification.
