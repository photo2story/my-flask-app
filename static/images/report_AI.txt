## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Relative Strength:**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  As of the last reported date, C3.ai's cumulative return is 17.27%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) at 67.22%.  This represents a difference of -50.0%, placing it at the 36.1 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  The provided alpha and beta values suggest significant outperformance (high alpha) but also high volatility and correlation with the market (high beta).  The CAGR is negative across all periods, indicating underperformance against market benchmarks.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) reveals substantial risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $36.39
* **5-day Moving Average:** $36.60
* **20-day Moving Average:** $29.72
* **60-day Moving Average:** $26.06

The price is currently above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, the 5-day moving average being slightly higher indicates some recent price consolidation or a minor pullback.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.39 (Overbought territory, suggesting potential short-term correction)
* **PPO:** 2.81 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +20.1% (Strong short-term upward momentum)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought in the short term. The positive PPO confirms bullish momentum. The significant positive change in relative strength further supports the short-term upward trend.  Given the closing price of $36.4 is slightly above the last market price, it doesnâ€™t suggest any extreme rapid price changes (no sign of rapid surge or plunge). The expected return of 0.0% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500,  suggests that even with long-term investment the company is expected to provide returns that track the market, given current information. This is highly uncertain and subject to future market conditions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The company's recent earnings show significant volatility. Revenue fluctuates considerably. EPS shows substantial swings between positive and highly negative numbers, suggesting unpredictable profitability. There's no information provided about expected earnings for comparison, therefore beats or misses cannot be assessed.  A notable point is the repeated entry of 2024-11-07 data, which needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively flat over the past few quarters, with slight increases. Profit margins are consistently high but show a slight downward trend.

* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable, but ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information about recent news (within the last 2 days), market outlook, and analyst opinions.  This data was not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai exhibits high growth potential based on its focus on a rapidly growing market, but also significant volatility and risk. While there is short-term bullish momentum suggested by technical indicators, the high RSI suggests caution.  The company's financial performance reveals inconsistent profitability and a negative return on equity.  Long-term investment carries considerable risk, given the historical underperformance against the S&P 500 and the significant negative ROE.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more comprehensive assessment of current market sentiment and future prospects.  Further investigation into the duplicated earnings data point (2024-11-07) is warranted.  Before investing, additional due diligence is highly recommended.
