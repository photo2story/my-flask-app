2025-02-28 - Analysis Report
## C3.ai Inc (AI) Stock Report

This report analyzes C3.ai Inc., a provider of enterprise AI software, based on the provided data.


**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

C3.ai's cumulative return (-13.65%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 56.15%.  The difference is a substantial -69.8%, placing it at the 12.2nd percentile of its historical range (based on a min/max range of -89.3% to 70%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance.  While recent periods (2022-2024) show positive CAGR and alpha, earlier periods show significantly negative returns and zero alpha, indicating a high-beta stock (very sensitive to market movements). The beta fluctuates, suggesting significant volatility in its sensitivity to market changes.  The small market capitalization (Cap(B)) also points to higher inherent risk.

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -96.0%   | 25.9%    | -86.0% | 0.0   | 1.4    |
| 2021-2023  | -24.0%   | 45.4%    | -48.0% | 0.0   | 3.7    |
| 2022-2024  | 82.0%    | 45.4%    | 49.0% | 0.0   | 4.4    |
| 2023-2025  | 15.0%    | 45.4%    | -39.0% | 0.1   | 3.1    |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is $23.88, down significantly from the previous close ($26.44).  The stock is trading below its 5-day ($26.41), 20-day ($30.91), and 60-day ($34.19) moving averages, indicating a clear downtrend.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

The RSI (18.5) suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.  However, the negative PPO (-2.6) confirms the bearish momentum. The recent relative divergence shows a -8% shift indicating short-term price decline. The large price drop from the previous close (-9.68%) signals a significant negative event or market sentiment shift. The expected return of -238.9% is highly negative and indicates significant downside risk relative to the S&P500 in the near term.  Long-term (2+ years) potential for outperformance is uncertain given the historical volatility and current state of the market.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings are volatile.  While Q1 2024 and Q3 2023 showed positive EPS, Q2 2024 and Q4 2024 show significant negative EPS. Revenue remains relatively stable but lacks consistent growth. This inconsistency highlights significant uncertainty about profitability.

| Date       | EPS       | Revenue       |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 0.72      | 6.75 B$       |
| 2024-08-01 | -6.02     | 6.56 B$       |
| 2024-05-02 | 1.75      | 6.76 B$       |
| 2023-11-02 | 2.83      | 7.27 B$       |
| 2024-11-07 | 2.83      | 7.27 B$       |


**5) Financial Information:**

Revenue is relatively flat over the past few quarters, with a consistent profit margin between 56% and 61%. However, Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity investments.  This is a major concern.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |

**6) Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai shows significant volatility and inconsistency in performance. While recent periods exhibit positive growth, the overall trend and financial health indicators (negative ROE, volatile EPS) raise significant concerns. The substantial underperformance against the S&P 500, coupled with high beta, underscores the considerable risk associated with this investment.  The negative expected return and technical indicators suggest caution.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the volatile earnings and negative ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Long-term investors should carefully weigh the potential for future growth against the inherent risks associated with this stock.
