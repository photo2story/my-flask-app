*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -3.2 (Downward trend)
*   **Expected Return:** -803.9%

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment, but the RSI of 42.20 indicates that the stock is not oversold.  The PPO is negative, implying a bearish trend. The Hybrid Signal suggests buying the stock with 100% cash, viewing it as very safe, while the expected return shows a massive, negative result. This contradiction raises concerns. The recent drop in divergence further confirms the short-term negative momentum. The change of -1.99% on the last day reflects a slight downward trend.

*   **Key Themes:** The news highlights the volatile AI sector, influenced by companies like Nvidia and Micron.
*   **Mixed Sentiment:** Some articles suggest potential for AI stocks in the future (e.g., Micron in 2026), while others express "AI anxiety" and market concerns.

*   **Oracle's impact:** Oracle leading an AI stock sell-off indicates the industry's sensitivity to individual company performance.
