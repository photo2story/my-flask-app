The difference is -49.6%, placing it at the 24.9th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-89.3% to 70.0%).

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2020-2022  | -96.0% | 25.9% | -86.0% | 0.0 | 1.4 |
| 2021-2023  | -24.0% | 45.4% | -48.0% | 0.0 | 3.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 82.0% | 45.4% | 49.0% | 0.0 | 4.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 42.0% | 45.4% | -19.0% | 0.1 | 4.0 |

**Analysis:**  The table reveals significant volatility and inconsistent performance. While C3.ai shows periods of strong growth (82% CAGR in 2022-2024), these are followed by periods of significant decline (-96% CAGR in 2020-2022).  The consistently low or negative alpha suggests it hasn't outperformed the market adjusted for its beta, which fluctuates, indicating changing market sensitivity.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $31.35
* **Previous Close:** $32.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $31.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $33.02
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $34.02

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend. The recent drop of -$2.18 (-6.8%) from the previous close indicates a potential short-term negative momentum.


**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.71 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.28 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.0 (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -100.0% (This suggests a negative outlook against the S&P 500 over the long term based on current data and analysis; this needs further clarification on calculation methodology.)

The technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook, but the RSI is not yet deeply oversold. The large negative expected return needs more context and justification.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue        |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 2024-11-07 | $0.72   | $6.75B         |
| 2024-08-01 | -$6.02  | $6.56B         |

| 2024-11-07 | $2.83   | $7.27B         | *(Duplicate Entry - Possible Error)*

**Analysis:** Earnings are highly volatile, with significant swings between positive and negative EPS. Revenue also fluctuates considerably. The duplicate entry for November 7th, 2024, requires clarification.  Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying causes of this volatility.

| 2024-01-31 | $0.90B | -8.09% |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.91B | -7.66% |

**Analysis:** Revenue shows slight growth, but it's relatively stagnant. Profit margins are high but consistent negative ROE is a significant concern, indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai exhibits high volatility and inconsistent performance, significantly underperforming the S&P 500. While recent quarters show high profit margins, the negative ROE raises serious concerns about long-term profitability and sustainability.  The highly volatile earnings and revenue figures need further investigation.  The provided -100% expected return needs clarification and justification before it can be considered reliable.  Before considering an investment, a thorough review of the company's fundamentals, future prospects, and risk factors is crucial. The data suggests a high-risk investment with significant potential for both substantial gains and losses.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended.
