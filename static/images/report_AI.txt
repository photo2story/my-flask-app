The volatile earnings and the need for improved profitability are key factors to consider.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the fluctuating earnings and negative ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment strategy needs to account for the high volatility and the potential for continued underperformance compared to broader market benchmarks.
