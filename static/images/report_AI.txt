## C3.ai Inc (AI) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500:**

C3.ai's cumulative return is 55.97%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) has returned 64.25%. This represents an 8.28% underperformance by C3.ai.  The relative divergence of 50.8 indicates that the current performance gap is near the middle of the historical range of differences between C3.ai and the S&P 500.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis Table Insights:**

The provided table shows volatile performance.  While CAGR swung dramatically from -96% to 113% over different periods, the consistent negative Alpha (-86%, -48%, and even with positive CAGR, only 74%) suggests the company has struggled to generate returns above the market benchmark, even considering its beta.  Beta consistently at 0.0 raises questions about the accuracy of the data or methodology used for this calculation.  Market capitalization has seen moderate growth.

* Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day): +2.2 (Positive, suggesting increasing outperformance vs. S&P 500)

The RSI indicates the stock is potentially overbought, suggesting a possible pullback.  However, the positive recent relative divergence change indicates short-term strength against the broader market.  The PPO suggests a weakening of positive momentum.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicate entries.  Focusing solely on the unique data points:

* Revenue fluctuated considerably between $6.56B and $12.58B. No clear trend is discernible.
* EPS is highly volatile, ranging from a significant loss of -$6.02 to a positive $2.83.  This volatility makes it difficult to identify a trend.
* Without context of analyst expectations, it is impossible to determine if these figures represent beats or misses.

The inconsistent and incomplete earnings data hinders meaningful analysis.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue has remained relatively flat over the past five quarters, hovering around $0.08B-$0.09B.
* **Profit Margin:**  Profit margins are consistently high, ranging between 56% and 61%.  This is a positive sign.
* **Equity:** Equity has remained relatively stable, showing a slight decrease over the period.
* **ROE:**  Return on equity is consistently negative, ranging from -7.18% to -8.35%. This indicates the company is not effectively using its equity to generate profits.

While consistent high profit margins are encouraging, flat revenue and negative ROE raise concerns about the company's overall financial health.

C3.ai has shown volatile performance, underperforming the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. Recent price action suggests positive momentum, but technical indicators like RSI and PPO present mixed signals.  Earnings data is inconsistent, making it difficult to draw clear conclusions.
