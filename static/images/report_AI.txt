## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  The cumulative return for C3.ai is 4.29%, significantly lagging the S&P 500's cumulative return of 64.05%.  The difference is -59.76%, placing it at the 29.01 percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum of -99.51% and a maximum of 37.53%).  This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows high beta values (1.4-4.1), indicating high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The alpha values (1.9-2.3), while positive, don't fully offset the significant negative CAGR (-87.9% to 0.2%) across the periods shown. This suggests that despite periods of outperformance (alpha), the overall return has been significantly below the market.


| Year       | CAGR     | MDD      | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -87.9%   | 61.2%    | -111.5% | 1.9   |        |
| 2021-2023  | -76.1%   | 61.2%    | -111.0% | 2.2   |        |

**5. Financial Information (Additional Data):**

The provided quarterly data shows consistent profitability (positive profit margins) but negative Return on Equity (ROE).  This suggests that while the company is generating revenue and profit, it's not generating sufficient returns relative to shareholder equity.  The relatively high profit margins are a positive aspect, but the negative ROE indicates potential concerns regarding efficiency or capital allocation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* _Missing Information:_  To provide a comprehensive analysis of recent news and issues,  information regarding earnings news from sources like Shacknews and Finbold within the last two days is needed. Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also crucial for a complete picture.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with high volatility and a mixed financial picture. While it demonstrates profitability and revenue growth in some quarters,  negative ROE raises concerns about the efficiency of capital utilization. The high beta suggests it is highly sensitive to market swings.  The overbought RSI and recent price pullback indicate a potential short-term correction.  The lack of recent news and analyst information prevents a complete evaluation of current market sentiment and outlook.  The inconsistencies in the reported EPS numbers require further investigation.  Long-term investment requires careful consideration of the risks and the potential for continued underperformance relative to the broader market.


**8.  Recommendations:**

More information is needed to provide specific recommendations.  Additional data points should include a more complete and reliable financial reporting analysis, recent news and market sentiment from credible sources and a deeper dive into the company's strategic initiatives and their potential impact on future performance.  The inherent volatility of C3.ai requires a risk tolerance assessment before considering any investment strategy.
