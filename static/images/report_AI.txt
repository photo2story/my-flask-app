**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  While some quarters show positive EPS and high revenue, others reveal substantial losses.  The data appears inconsistent and needs deeper investigation to understand the underlying factors.


| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-11-07 | 0.72 | 6.75 B$ |

|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.09B | 61.31% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai shows considerable risk and volatility.  While some periods exhibit positive growth, the overall trend is bearish, with significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The negative ROE, volatile earnings, and extreme negative expected return are major concerns.  The extremely oversold RSI might suggest a short-term bounce, but the fundamental issues need to be addressed before considering a long-term investment.  Further investigation into the reasons for the volatile earnings and negative ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The -271.2% expected return should be treated with extreme caution and requires careful review of its calculation methodology and underlying assumptions.  This report highlights the need for in-depth due diligence before any investment in C3.ai.
