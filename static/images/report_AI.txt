## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes C3.ai Inc. (AI), a provider of enterprise AI software, based on the provided data.  The analysis encompasses performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, technical indicators, financial statements, and recent news.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

C3.ai has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The cumulative return for C3.ai is -14.46%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 63.15%. This results in a substantial divergence of -77.61%. The relative divergence of -15.98% indicates that C3.ai's performance is in the lower percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR data further highlights significant underperformance over the past few years, ranging from -76.1% to -87.9%.  High Beta values (1.4 to 3.5) indicate higher volatility than the market, amplifying both gains and losses.  A positive Alpha suggests outperformance relative to the benchmark, but this is negated by the overall negative cumulative return.  High MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values also indicate substantial periods of significant loss.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $26.54
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $26.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $26.23
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $24.65

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average and above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term consolidation or minor upward trend. The relatively close proximity of these averages indicates limited short-term volatility.  The last market price of $26.55 is not significantly different enough to indicate a sudden surge or drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (51.08):**  Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The market is relatively neutral.
* **PPO (-0.34):** Negative value indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (1.96, +):** Suggests a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided expected return of 0% for long-term (2+ years) investment relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and warrants further investigation.  This would indicate the market does not expect outperformance even on a long-term horizon, likely due to past performance and current negative sentiment.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While some quarters show positive EPS, others show substantial losses.  There's a lack of context around the most recent earnings ($0.72 EPS, $6.75B revenue on 2024-11-07).  To fully assess this, comparison to analyst expectations and guidance is crucial, as well as detailed analysis of the factors contributing to the volatility.


**5. Revenue and Profitability (Quarter Data):**

Revenue has remained relatively stable around $0.07-$0.09 billion per quarter, but Profit Margins have shown a slight downward trend.  ROE has consistently been negative, indicating that the company is not generating returns on its equity. This is a significant concern and requires further investigation into the underlying causes.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

Analyzing recent earnings news and analyst opinions is essential to understand the current market outlook and performance highlights.


**7. Comprehensive Analysis:**

C3.ai is currently experiencing significant challenges. The stock has substantially underperformed the S&P 500, showing consistent losses over the past few years. Although some positive indicators exist (such as the recent short-term upward trend suggested by the relative divergence and the relatively stable revenue), these are overshadowed by negative ROE, erratic earnings, and a negative market outlook (as indicated by the 0% expected return).  High volatility and negative momentum are confirmed by the technical indicators.  A thorough investigation into the reasons behind the negative ROE and inconsistent earnings is crucial before any investment decisions are made.  Further analysis is needed to assess the sustainability of the recent earnings, particularly in light of analyst expectations.

**8. Recommendations:**

Based on the available data, C3.ai presents a high-risk investment. While the company operates in a promising sector (enterprise AI), its current financial performance and market sentiment are negative.  Thorough due diligence, including detailed financial statement analysis and consideration of industry trends and competitor analysis, is strongly recommended before any investment.  The 0% expected long-term return compared to the S&P 500 should serve as a significant caution.
