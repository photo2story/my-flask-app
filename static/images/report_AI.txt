    *   60-day MA: 18.41

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The significant price drop in the last market session (-3.68%) confirms recent negative momentum.

**3. Indicators and Signals**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 54.29 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.18 (Neutral)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (57 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.7% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Recent 20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.9 (Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** -378.0% (Significant underperformance vs. S&P 500 over a 2+ year investment horizon)

*   **Analysis:** While the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, the RSI and PPO are relatively neutral. The negative change in relative divergence, coupled with the significant drop in the last market session, indicates a potential short-term negative trend. The Hybrid Signal recommends buying, potentially driven by the MRI and valuation considerations.  However, the very low (highly negative) expected return suggests that, based on the current models, the stock is projected to underperform the S&P 500 significantly over the long term. The price drop of -3.68% in the last market is a noticeable negative factor.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| 날짜         | EPS   | 매출        |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| 2025-08-07 | 2     | 7.09 B$     |
| 2025-05-02 | 1.18  | 6.78 B$     |
| 2024-11-07 | 0.72  | 6.75 B$     |
| 2024-08-01 | -6.02 | 6.56 B$     |
| 2025-08-07 | -6.02 | 6.56 B$     |

*   **Analysis:** The provided data is inconsistent and seemingly duplicated, making a proper earnings analysis impossible.  There are two entries for 2025-08-07 with different (and contradictory) EPS and revenue figures. This casts doubt on the reliability of this data. The large negative EPS figures are concerning.

**6. Financial Information**

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-07-31 | $0.07B    | 37.64%        |
| 2025-04-30 | $0.11B    | 62.09%        |
| 2025-01-31 | $0.10B    | 59.07%        |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.09B    | 61.31%        |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.09B    | 59.81%        |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-07-31 | $0.80B    | -14.62%   |
| 2025-04-30 | $0.84B    | -9.51%    |
| 2025-01-31 | $0.86B    | -9.32%    |
| 2024-10-31 | $0.86B    | -7.68%    |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B    | -7.18%    |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue appears to be growing, but not consistently.  Profit margins are quite high, which is a positive. However, the negative ROE (Return on Equity) values indicate that the company is not generating profits from its equity. Equity is decreasing. The fact that the profit margins are high while the ROE is negative suggests there are issues on the capital structure or expenses side of the business.

**7. Overall Assessment**

Based on the provided data, C3.ai presents a mixed picture:

*   **Negatives:** Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent price weakness.  Highly negative expected return. Unclear analyst consensus and a wide range in target prices. Inconsistent earnings data and negative ROE values are concerning. Recent negative news headlines.
*   **Positives:** High profit margins. High MRI score indicates potential for investment. Hybrid signal recommends buying.
*   **Key Concerns:** The most significant concern is the severe underperformance relative to the market and the highly negative expected return. The inconsistency in the earnings data is a red flag that needs to be investigated further.

**Conclusion:**

While the MRI and Hybrid Signal suggest some potential investment opportunity, the overall picture is concerning.  The stock carries significant risk, and a thorough investigation of the earnings and financial health of the company is essential before considering an investment. The negative long-term expected return is a serious warning sign. The recent price drop and mixed news flow further contribute to the cautious outlook.
