2024-12-18 - Analysis Report
## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  The provided data shows C3.ai's cumulative return (56.26%) lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (65.18%) by 8.92 percentage points as of the last data point.  The relative outperformance, considering historical volatility, places it at the 50.5th percentile compared to the S&P 500.  While the CAGR shows periods of strong growth (113% in 2022-2024), the significant negative CAGRs in previous periods highlight high volatility and risk.  The beta values (1.0, 4.0, and 6.0 across different periods) demonstrate a higher sensitivity to market movements than the S&P 500 (beta of 1), especially in the 2021-2023 period.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $42.94
* **Last Market Price:** $43.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $40.11
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $37.14
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $29.40

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The relatively large difference between the 5-day and 60-day moving averages points to a recent acceleration in price.  A price of $43.10 reflects this recent upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (64.63):** Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral short-term outlook.
* **PPO (-0.23):** Negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.  This contrasts with the recent price action, raising a cautionary flag.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (2.5+):** Suggests a short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  This suggests that, based on the provided data, there's no expected outperformance against the S&P 500 in the long term (2+ years) with a buy-and-hold strategy.  This zero-return projection should be approached cautiously due to the data limitations.  The high volatility and beta also significantly affect risk-adjusted returns.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The quarterly earnings data reveals significant volatility:

* **Revenue:** Shows inconsistent growth, with significant swings between quarters.  For example, Q1 2024 shows a drastic jump compared to the preceding quarters.
* **EPS:** Exhibits extreme volatility, including substantial negative EPS in Q2 2024.  This high variability indicates unpredictable earnings.  There's no consistent trend to determine beat or miss vs. expectations from this limited dataset.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue remained relatively stable around $0.09B for the last four quarters, with a slightly increasing profit margin.
* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity has generally decreased, and ROE remains consistently negative, indicating the company has not generated positive returns on its equity over this period.

The financial information underscores the need for further investigation into the underlying reasons for the negative ROE and the variability in earnings and revenue.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News (within 2 days):**  The provided data includes an earnings report from 2024-11-07. Further details are needed to assess market reaction.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai demonstrates high growth potential but also significant risk. The stock has shown periods of dramatic price swings, with the recent upward trend needing further confirmation. The inconsistent earnings and negative ROE raise concerns about profitability and sustainability.  While the short-term technical indicators suggest an upward trend, the negative PPO and the overall volatile nature of the company call for caution.  Further investigation is needed to assess the company's long-term prospects and the drivers of the observed volatility. The absence of analyst opinions and broader market outlook data prevents a comprehensive conclusion. More thorough due diligence is crucial before any investment decision.
