*Alpha, Beta Analysis*

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -64.0%  | 77.9% | -40.0% | -0.1  | 1.6    |
| 2021-2023  | 6.0%    | 82.8% | 5.0%  | -0.0  | 4.0    |
| 2022-2024  | 59.0%   | 82.8% | 39.0% | 0.0   | 4.8    |
| 2023-2025  | -5.0%  | 82.8% | -71.0% | 0.0  | 2.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate is highly volatile, swinging from -64% to +59%. This signals substantial risk.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, showing significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:**  A positive alpha would indicate outperformance relative to the benchmark. The alphas fluctuate greatly.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are very low, suggesting that AI's price is almost uncorrelated with the market(S&P500).

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 14.44
*   **Last-market:** price: 14.44, previousClose: 13.77, change: 4.87%
*   **5-day SMA:** 14.28
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.70
*   **60-day SMA:** 16.24

**Analysis:**

The stock closed at 14.44, showing a decent gain of 4.87% compared to the previous close. The 5-day SMA (14.28) is below the 20-day SMA (14.70), which is below the 60-day SMA (16.24). This indicates a potential downward trend as shorter-term momentum is weaker than longer-term momentum. The increase of 4.87% mitigates downward trend risk.

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.81
*   **PPO:** -0.17
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (69 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.2 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -803.9%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  A MRI of 0.7 suggests "Medium Investment" risk, leaning towards the less risky side.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 50.81 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A slightly negative PPO (-0.17) indicates the short-term moving average is slightly below the long-term moving average, suggesting a weak downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests a 100% buy with a very safe MRI, allocating investment.
*   **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:**  The negative value (-3.2) confirms a recent short-term decline, consistent with the SMA analysis.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-803.9%) is highly concerning and suggests significant downside risk.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Bullish Headlines:** Several articles suggest potential outperformance ("Why This AI Stock Could Outperform Nvidia…", "Stealth AI Stock Eyes Entry Amid Powerful Run…", "Prediction: This AI Stock Will Be the Most Surprising Winner of 2026").

*   **Industry Context:** "Micron's Blowout Earnings: The Best AI Stock for 2026?" - Implies that AI enablers/infrastructure providers might be more promising investments than specific AI application companies like C3.ai.

**Analysis:**

The news sentiment is mixed. While some articles are bullish, suggesting potential for future growth, others highlight competition and the broader AI industry landscape, implying that C3.ai is not necessarily the only or best option.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

**Analysis:**

The analyst consensus is a "Hold," with a mean rating reflecting this neutral stance. The average target price (14.67) is slightly above the current price (14.44), implying a small potential upside.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue |
|------------|------|---------|
| 2025-11-05 | 0.94 | 6.35 B$ |
| 2025-08-07 | 2    | 7.09 B$ |
| 2025-05-02 | 1.18 | 6.78 B$ |
| 2024-11-07 | 0.72 | 6.75 B$ |
| 2025-11-05 | 0.72 | 6.75 B$ |

**Analysis:**

The EPS and revenue fluctuate. This inconsistency reinforces the volatility observed in the CAGR. The inconsistency makes it difficult to establish a clear positive trend.

**6) Financial Information**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-10-31   | $0.08B   | 40.43%        |
| 2025-07-31   | $0.07B   | 37.64%        |
| 2025-04-30   | $0.11B   | 62.09%        |
| 2025-01-31   | $0.10B   | 59.07%        |
| 2024-10-31   | $0.09B   | 61.31%        |

*   **Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity   | ROE      |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| 2025-10-31   | $0.77B   | -13.56%  |
| 2025-07-31   | $0.80B   | -14.62%  |
| 2025-04-30   | $0.84B   | -9.51%   |
| 2025-01-31   | $0.86B   | -9.32%   |
| 2024-10-31   | $0.86B   | -7.68%   |

**Analysis:**

Revenue appears to be relatively stable around $0.07B to $0.11B per quarter. Profit margins are healthy, ranging from 37.64% to 62.09%. However, the consistently negative Return on Equity (ROE) values are concerning. ROE measures how effectively a company is using shareholder investments to generate profits. Negative ROE suggests the company is not profitable relative to its equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

C3.ai (AI) presents a mixed picture.

*   **Negative Performance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a large negative cumulative return and divergence near its worst levels.
*   **Volatile History:** Past performance has shown high volatility.
*   **Downwards Trend:** Recent price movement shows a potentially downward trend.
*   **Healthy Profit Margins, but Unprofitable:** Revenue is relatively stable and profit margins are strong, but the company is not profitable as suggested by the negative ROE.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Analyst opinions are neutral ("Hold"), but target prices vary widely, reflecting disagreement.
*   **News Sentiment:** News is mixed, with both bullish and cautionary articles.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the provided information, a conservative approach is warranted. The significant underperformance, negative ROE, and high volatility suggest substantial risk. While some news articles suggest future potential, the overall picture is not compelling. The hybrid signal shows buy recommendations based on the indicators.

Therefore, **a neutral stance is most appropriate**. If considering an investment, conduct thorough due diligence, focusing on the company's path to profitability and competitive position within the AI landscape. Closely monitor future earnings reports and analyst revisions.
