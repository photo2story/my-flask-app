| 2023-2025  | -7.0%   | 82.8% | -75.0% | 0.0  | 2.0    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The company has experienced fluctuating growth, with strong performance in 2022-2024, but significant declines in other periods.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha fluctuates considerably and is significantly negative in the 2023-2025 period, implying considerable underperformance relative to a risk-free investment.

*   **20-day SMA:** 14.76
*   **60-day SMA:** 16.03

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 38.95
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.33
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (69 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -2.3 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1418.0 (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** It's contradictory to see a High Investment Recommendation with other bearish signs. It suggests the MRI calculation might be flawed or based on different factors not fully reflected in the other indicators.
*   **RSI:** The RSI of 38.95 is approaching oversold territory (below 30), which *could* indicate a potential for a rebound.  However, it's not yet definitively oversold.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, reinforcing the bearish trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** While stating "Very Safe" the high investment (100% of cash) is a contradiction in the analysis based on other bearish indicators (the text's hybrid signal needs to be manually reviewed).
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** Indicates recent underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:**  The extremely negative expected return raises a *significant red flag*.  It suggests the model forecasts severe underperformance in the long term compared to the S&P 500.
