## C3.ai Inc (AI) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes C3.ai Inc (AI), a provider of enterprise AI software, based on the provided data.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

C3.ai's cumulative return is 22.0%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's 66.67% return.  The difference is -44.67%, placing it at the 40.02 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max range).  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided CAGR data further underscores this underperformance, showing substantial negative returns in the periods 2020-2022 and 2021-2023.  Only the 2022-2024 period shows positive CAGR, but still below the S&P 500's performance.  The high beta values (1.4 to 4.6) suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $37.86
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $35.12
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $28.70
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $25.62

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, the relatively large gap between the current price and the 20 and 60 day moving averages might indicate a potential pullback or correction.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 82.7 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential price correction is likely.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 3.71 – A positive value suggests upward momentum, although the RSI suggests caution.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +23.36 – Indicates a recent upward trend in relative performance.

The current price of $37.86, significantly higher than the moving averages, might signal a recent rapid price increase (a potential "pump").  Careful consideration is needed due to the overbought RSI.  The expected return of 0.0% suggests no significant outperformance of the S&P 500 is expected over the long term (2+ years) based on this current data. This should be considered alongside the information about alpha and beta provided above.  


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While the latest earnings report shows positive EPS (0.72 and the earlier reported 2.83) and revenue ($6.75B and $7.27B), earlier quarters show considerable losses. This inconsistency makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the company's current financial health without access to a full picture of the earnings report, which includes revenue, costs and profit, details on the company's financial position, forecast and context. Further investigation is necessary to assess the sustainability of these most recent positive results.


**6. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Shows relatively stable revenue around $0.07-$0.09B per quarter, with profit margins consistently above 50%.  However, the scale of the revenue needs to be considered against the high stock value and the company's large valuation.  Profitability seems to depend on very high profit margins rather than a large volume of sales.

* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity remains relatively stable, but Return on Equity (ROE) is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital. This is a significant concern.


**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires access to real-time news sources such as Shacknews and Finbold to provide up-to-date information on recent earnings news, market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights.  Please provide links to relevant news articles if you have them.)*


**8. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai shows a mixed picture.  While the recent price action indicates short-term upward momentum, several factors cause concern:

* **Significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.**
* **High beta, indicating high volatility.**
* **Overbought RSI, suggesting a potential price correction.**
* **Inconsistent earnings performance, with recent positive earnings that require further analysis to determine their sustainability.**
* **Negative ROE, indicating poor returns on invested capital.**

The 0% expected return suggests that long-term investment in C3.ai may not yield significant outperformance against the S&P 500, given the present data.  Further investigation into the company's fundamentals, news, and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The recent price increase could be speculative and unsustainable without supporting improvements in profitability and financial performance.  The substantial risk associated with the high beta and volatile earnings should be carefully considered.
