* **5-Day Moving Average:** $39.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $38.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $30.36

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates a recent price drop.

* **PPO:** -2.19 (Negative; suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -4.6% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (The provided data does not give a reliable basis for a long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500.  More comprehensive financial modeling would be required.)

The current price of $36.34, being below the moving averages and coupled with a negative PPO, indicates a recent downturn, not necessarily a sharp drop.  The neutral RSI suggests the market may not be heavily bearish.  The 0% expected return should be viewed cautiously as it is a placeholder.
