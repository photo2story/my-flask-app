The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance:

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                    |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| 2020-2022  | -96.0% | 25.9% | -86.0% | 1.4   |       | Extremely poor performance.                |
| 2021-2023  | -24.0% | 45.4% | -48.0% | 3.7   |       | Still negative CAGR, high beta.          |
| 2022-2024  | 82.0% | 45.4% | 49.0% | 4.5   |       | Significant recovery, extremely high beta. |
| 2023-2025  | 50.0% | 45.4% | -11.0% | 4.3   |       | Strong performance, high beta.            |

The high beta values indicate significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  While recent periods show positive CAGR, the overall picture reflects substantial risk.  Alpha consistently near zero suggests little outperformance relative to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $33.65
* **Last Market Price:** $33.72 (+$0.07) - a small positive change.
* **5-day Moving Average:** $32.83
* **20-day Moving Average:** $32.45
* **60-day Moving Average:** $34.46

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend in the medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.08 -  Slightly above neutral (50), suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.77 - Positive, indicating potential bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +3.8 - Shows short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** -77.8% -  This signifies a projected significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon assuming continued performance similar to recent data.  The small price increase in the last market data does not significantly alter this long-term outlook.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data is inconsistent and volatile:

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      | Notes                                      |
|------------|--------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| 2024-11-07 | $0.72  | $6.75B       |                                          |
| 2024-08-01 | -$6.02 | $6.56B       | Significant loss                          |
| 2024-05-02 | $1.75  | $12.58B      | Highest revenue in this sample            |
| 2023-11-02 | $2.83  | $7.27B       |                                          |
| 2024-11-07 | $2.83  | $7.27B       | Duplicate entry; likely a data error.     |

The data needs clarification due to the duplicate entry. Revenue fluctuations are substantial, and profitability is highly erratic.


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively stable, but profit margins are high although showing a slight downward trend.  Equity is relatively stable, but ROE is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | $0.09B   | 61.31%         |
| 2024-07-31 | $0.09B   | 59.81%         |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.09B   | 59.60%         |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.08B   | 57.76%         |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.07B   | 56.14%         |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| 2024-07-31 | $0.87B  | -7.18%  |
| 2024-04-30 | $0.87B  | -8.35%  |
| 2024-01-31 | $0.90B  | -8.09%  |
| 2023-10-31 | $0.91B  | -7.66%  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai exhibits significant volatility and inconsistent performance. While recent periods show positive growth, the overall picture reveals substantial risk.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500, coupled with the negative ROE, raises serious concerns about long-term investment prospects.  The erratic earnings data requires further investigation to confirm accuracy.  Investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough due diligence before making any investment decisions.  The high beta suggests that this stock is not suitable for risk-averse investors.
