**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

|------------|----------|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -50.5%   | 61.2%    | -57.9% | 3.3   |        |
| 2021-2023  | -37.9%   | 61.2%    | -48.4% | 5.0   |        |
| 2022-2024  | 4.1%     | 48.1%    | -5.3%  | 4.5   |        |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $36.39
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $36.60
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $29.72
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $26.06

The stock price is currently above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  However, the difference between the 5-day and 20-day averages is narrowing.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 75.39 (Overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 2.81 (Positive, indicating upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +20.1% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0% (This indicates the model does not expect C3.ai to outperform the S&P 500 over the long term, given current information)

The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and prone to a correction.  The positive PPO supports the short-term upward trend indicated by the relative strength change. The 0% expected return warrants caution, indicating the potential for underperformance relative to the market.  A price of $36.4 doesn't automatically signal a sharp reversal, but given the overbought RSI, a consolidation or minor correction is plausible.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There is no clear trend in revenue growth.  EPS has fluctuated wildly, with significant losses in some quarters and substantial gains in others.  Without access to expected earnings, it's impossible to assess whether these numbers were beats or misses.

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| 2024-11-07 | $0.72   | $6.75 B      |
| 2024-08-01 | -$6.02  | $6.56 B      |
| 2024-05-02 | $1.75   | $12.58 B     |
| 2023-11-02 | $2.83   | $7.27 B      |
| 2024-11-07 | $2.83   | $7.27 B      | *(Duplicate entry - likely a typo)*


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable over the past five quarters, showing minimal growth. Profit margins have been consistently high (above 55%), but this needs to be considered in relation to the volatile EPS.  Equity has shown a slight decline, while Return on Equity (ROE) has been consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity.

| Quarter     | Revenue     | Profit Margin | Equity    | ROE      |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| 2024-07-31  | $0.09B      | 59.81%        | $0.87B    | -7.18%   |
| 2024-04-30  | $0.09B      | 59.60%        | $0.87B    | -8.35%   |

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which are not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai has shown significant volatility in both price and earnings.  While the stock has experienced periods of strong performance relative to the market (indicated by the high beta values), its recent performance has lagged the S&P 500.  High profit margins are partially offset by negative ROE and volatile EPS.  Technical indicators suggest the stock may be overbought, raising concerns about a potential correction.  The lack of positive long-term expected return and the need for further information on recent news and analyst sentiment makes recommending a course of action challenging.  Further investigation into the recent earnings reports (beyond the limited data provided) and market sentiment is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
