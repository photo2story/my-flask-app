## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Review

This report analyzes C3.ai Inc. (AI), a provider of enterprise AI software.  The analysis is based on the provided data and does not include external research or market predictions beyond what is explicitly given.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

C3.ai's cumulative return of 35.82% significantly lags the S&P 500's return of 63.96% over the unspecified period.  The difference is -28.1%, placing it at the 38.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a range of -89.3% to 70%).  The provided CAGR data shows significant volatility, with large negative returns in some periods and strong positive returns in others, highlighting the risk associated with this investment.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $37.32
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $36.06
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $38.36
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $30.98

The price is currently below its 20-day moving average and above its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term pullback within a longer-term uptrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 49.64 (near neutral)
* **PPO:** -2.51 (slightly bearish)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -9.2% (short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -55.4% relative to the S&P 500. This indicates a significant underperformance expectation compared to the benchmark index over a longer timeframe.  The provided $37.32 price is not significantly different from the moving averages to trigger an interpretation of a rapid price change (either up or down).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows extreme volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There is no consistent trend.  Noteworthy is the significant drop in EPS from Q1 2024 ($1.75) to Q2 2024 (-$6.02), followed by a recovery in Q3 2024 ($0.72).  Revenue fluctuates significantly between quarters as well, without a clear upward or downward trend.  Without access to earnings expectations, it's impossible to determine whether any quarters represented a "beat" or "miss."  The duplication of the November 7th, 2024, data point suggests an error in the provided data.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively flat at around $0.09B for the last few quarters, with slight increases. Profit margins have shown a consistent, albeit slow, upward trend.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has slightly decreased over the past year.  ROE remains consistently negative, indicating a lack of profitability in relation to equity.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent market outlook, analyst opinions, or performance highlights are provided.  The analysis is limited to the provided data.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai's performance is highly volatile.  While recent profit margins show a slight improvement, the negative ROE and significantly negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term raise serious concerns.  The erratic earnings data complicates the analysis, and the lack of external context limits a thorough assessment.  Further investigation into the causes of the EPS and revenue volatility, alongside external market analysis, would be crucial before drawing any definitive conclusions. The data suggests high risk and uncertainty surrounding this investment.
