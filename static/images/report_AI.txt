2025-01-21 - Analysis Report
Here's a report summarizing the analysis of C3.ai Inc (AI) based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  Over the observed period, AI's cumulative return (16.01%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 61.65%.  The difference is -45.6%, placing it in the 27.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows highly volatile performance with varying CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and significant maximum drawdown (MDD).  The beta consistently around 4.0 indicates high sensitivity to market movements. The alpha of 0.0 suggests that the stock has not significantly outperformed the market after adjusting for its beta. Note that this analysis is based on limited historical data.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $32.01
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $31.58
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $34.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $32.95

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The recent price change (-$0.93) reflects a small drop compared to the previous closing price.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 29.78 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price bounce.  However, this should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.

* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -1.66 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.

* **Delta Previous Relative Divergence:** -4.8% –  This shows a recent short-term downward trend in relative performance to the market.

* **Expected Return:** -89.1% – This extremely negative long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern and suggests a very high risk profile.  The large negative value should be viewed with skepticism unless its calculation methodology is explicitly defined and justifiable.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS (Earnings Per Share) and revenue.  There are inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate entry for 2024-11-07).  A more reliable and complete dataset is needed for a thorough analysis.  The large swings in EPS highlight substantial uncertainty regarding the company's profitability.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively flat around $0.09B for the last few quarters, while profit margins show a slight downward trend.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has decreased slightly over the last few quarters.  Return on Equity (ROE) consistently shows negative values, indicating that the company is not generating profits on its shareholder equity. This is a serious red flag.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai (AI) shows several significant warning signs:

* **Significant underperformance:**  The stock significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
* **High volatility and risk:**  High beta, large MDD, and fluctuating earnings indicate significant volatility and risk.
* **Negative ROE:** Consistently negative ROE signifies poor profitability and inefficient use of capital.
* **Concerning Expected Return:** The extremely low projected return relative to the S&P 500 raises serious questions about the long-term investment viability.

While the oversold RSI suggests potential for a short-term price bounce, the fundamental weakness, negative long-term outlook, and high volatility make AI a highly risky investment.  More detailed and reliable financial information is needed for a confident assessment.  Considering the current data, a cautious approach is advised.  Further due diligence and expert financial advice are strongly recommended before any investment decision.
