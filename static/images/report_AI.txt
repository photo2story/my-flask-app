Here's a comprehensive analysis of C3.ai Inc. (AI) based on the provided data, presented in a report format.

**C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Performance Report**

**1. Executive Summary:**

C3.ai Inc. (AI), a provider of enterprise AI software, significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  While the company showed some signs of recovery in recent quarters, it still lags behind the market benchmark considerably.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is currently in oversold territory, but fundamental analysis reveals concerns regarding profitability and return on equity.  Further analysis is required to determine if the current valuation represents a buying opportunity.

**2. Performance Relative to S&P 500:**

* **Company Overview:** C3.ai Inc. develops and sells enterprise-grade artificial intelligence (AI) software solutions for various industries.
* **Cumulative Return:** C3.ai: 17.50%; S&P 500 (VOO): 55.48%.
* **Return Difference:** C3.ai underperformed the S&P 500 by 37.98 percentage points.
* **Relative Performance:** The relative performance of -38.0 places C3.ai in the 32.2nd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates relatively weak performance compared to its historical range.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided alpha and beta figures are inconsistent across different periods.  While Beta generally sits around 4 indicating high volatility relative to the market, the alpha is consistently near zero suggesting no significant outperformance above market returns.  This inconsistency highlights the significant volatility and inconsistent performance of the stock.


**3. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $32.42
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $35.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $36.85
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $32.48

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages. This suggests a bearish trend.  The close proximity of the closing price to the 60-day moving average indicates a potential support level.


**4. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 29.54.  An RSI below 30 indicates that the stock is oversold.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.99. A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -4.3. This confirms the negative short-term trend indicated by the moving averages.
* **Expected Return:** -71.3%.  This suggests a significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon (2+ years).  This significant negative expectation requires further investigation into the assumptions and methodology used in this calculation.


**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicate entries for 2024-11-07.  Inconsistencies make it difficult to draw reliable conclusions.  Significant volatility in EPS and revenue is apparent.  Further investigation is needed to understand the cause of the volatility in revenue and the negative EPS figures.


**6. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively stable around $0.09B in recent quarters. However, profit margins, while high, have shown a slight downward trend.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been relatively stable, but ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently negative, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital.  This is a significant cause for concern.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai's stock performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  While the stock is currently in oversold territory according to the RSI, this doesn't necessarily signal a buy signal.  The negative ROE, inconsistent earnings data, and the significantly negative projected long-term return raise serious concerns about the company's financial health and future prospects.  The high beta indicates significant volatility, amplifying both potential gains and losses.  Before considering an investment, a thorough review of the company's financial statements and future strategic plans is essential.  Investigating the causes of the volatility in earnings data is crucial to assess the underlying business health and the validity of the projected return.  Further investigation into the methodology behind the extremely negative long-term expected return is also necessary.
