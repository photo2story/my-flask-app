## C3.ai Inc (AI) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.

The cumulative return of C3.ai (16.30%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) (59.71%) over the measured period.  The difference is -43.4%, placing it at the 28.8th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500's range (-89.3% to 70.0%).  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.  The provided CAGR of 16.0% from 2020-2025 shows relatively stable growth, but the high MDD (53.6%) and negative Alpha (-43.0%) point to significant risk and underperformance relative to the market (Beta of 4.0 indicates high volatility).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $32.09
* **Last Market Price:** $32.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $31.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $35.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $32.84

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 37.27 (Below 50, indicating bearish sentiment)
* **PPO:** -1.98 (Negative, confirming bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -3.3% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -83.2% (This is a significantly negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500.  This requires further clarification on how this figure was calculated.)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the price being below its moving averages and a negative relative divergence, suggest a bearish outlook. The extremely negative long-term expected return is a significant concern. The provided Last Market price ($32.10) is not significantly different from the closing price ($32.09) hence no sharp movement is observed.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's a large swing from positive to significantly negative EPS.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers behind this variability.  Note that the 2024-11-07 data is duplicated. This needs clarification.

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-11-07 | 0.72  | 6.75         |
| 2024-08-01 | -6.02 | 6.56         |
| 2024-05-02 | 1.75  | 12.58        |
| 2023-11-02 | 2.83  | 7.27         |
| 2024-11-07 | 2.83  | 7.27         |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals consistent revenue around $0.09B per quarter but a declining Equity and negative ROE. This suggests profitability challenges despite relatively stable revenue. The consistently high profit margin is notable, but the negative ROE indicates that the company might not be efficiently utilizing its equity to generate profits.

| Quarter     | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-10-31 | 0.09         | 61.31%        | 0.86        | -7.68   |
| 2024-07-31 | 0.09         | 59.81%        | 0.87        | -7.18   |
| 2024-04-30 | 0.09         | 59.60%        | 0.87        | -8.35   |
| 2024-01-31 | 0.08         | 57.76%        | 0.90        | -8.09   |
| 2023-10-31 | 0.07         | 56.14%        | 0.91        | -7.66   |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai's performance is currently weak relative to the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend.  While revenue is relatively stable, the erratic earnings, negative ROE, and significantly negative long-term expected return are major concerns.  The high beta signifies considerable risk.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the volatile earnings and the extremely negative expected return. The provided data raises serious questions about the long-term viability of C3.ai as an investment.  Considerable caution is advised.  Before investing, consult with a financial advisor and conduct thorough due diligence.  The duplicated data points in the earnings report need clarification.
