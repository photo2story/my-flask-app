**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue:

| Date        | EPS    | Revenue      |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-11-07  | $0.72  | $6.75 B       |
| 2024-08-01  | -$6.02 | $6.56 B       |
| 2024-05-02  | $1.75  | $12.58 B      |

| 2024-11-07  | $2.83  | $7.27 B       |

There's no consistency in revenue growth trends and significant fluctuations in EPS, indicating substantial quarter-to-quarter variability.  A massive negative EPS in Q1 2025 (-$6.02) stands out as a significant miss.  The duplicate entry for 2024-11-07 needs clarification, as it suggests a possible error in the data.
