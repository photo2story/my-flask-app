2025-01-07 - Analysis Report
## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  The cumulative return of C3.ai (33.84%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (60.90%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -27.1%, placing it at the 39th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500's performance.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows wildly fluctuating alpha and beta values across different time periods.  This suggests high volatility and potentially inconsistent correlation with the market.  Further investigation is needed into the methodology used to calculate these metrics. The consistently low alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market, considering the risk (beta).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $36.93
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $35.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $37.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $32.13

The price is slightly below its 20-day moving average, indicating potential short-term bearish pressure. However, it's above the 5-day and significantly above the 60-day moving average, suggesting a possible upward trend in the longer term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (43.67):** Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, though leaning slightly towards oversold territory.
* **PPO (-1.54):** Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (2.8, +):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-53.4%):**  This indicates a substantial negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon. This is a very pessimistic projection and warrants further investigation into its calculation methodology.  The current price of $36.93 doesn't seem to reflect a significant recent event causing a sharp upturn or downturn based on the provided data alone.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates considerably between quarters, with some significant jumps (e.g., from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024) and subsequent drops.  A clear trend is not readily apparent from just these few data points.
* **EPS:**  High variability in EPS, with significant swings between positive and negative values.  This instability raises concerns about earnings predictability.  The repetition of the November 2024 data point raises questions about data accuracy.

Without access to expected earnings or market consensus, it's impossible to definitively determine whether results "beat" or "missed" expectations.  The provided data alone highlights inconsistent and volatile financial performance.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively flat at around $0.09B for the past few quarters. While profit margins are consistently high (above 55%), the absolute revenue figures are low, limiting overall profitability.
* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable, but ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating sufficient returns on its equity investment. This is a major concern.

C3.ai exhibits significant volatility in both price and earnings. While profit margins are high, low revenue and negative ROE are major concerns.  The stock significantly underperforms the S&P 500, based on the provided data.  Technical indicators present a mixed signal, and the extremely negative long-term expected return projection is a significant red flag. The inconsistent and volatile nature of the financial data necessitates a thorough review of the companyâ€™s strategy, business model, and competitive landscape before making any investment decisions.  The missing information regarding recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation.
