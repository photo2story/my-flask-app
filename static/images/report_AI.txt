**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

C3.ai's cumulative return is 44.44%, while the S&P 500's (VOO) is 57.77%.  This represents a difference of -13.3%. The relative divergence of -13.3% places it in the 47.7th percentile of its historical range (max: 70.0%, min: -89.3%).

While the Beta fluctuates (indicating varying sensitivity to market movements), the Alpha consistently remains near zero, suggesting it hasn't significantly outperformed or underperformed the market based on these specific periods. The market capitalization varies as well.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $40.64
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $38.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $29.97

The price is currently below its 5-day moving average but above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term pullback after a period of upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.65 (Slightly above neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.62 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** 8.3 (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0%  This is a stated expectation; the actual long-term return against the S&P 500 is uncertain and depends on many factors not included in this analysis.

Given the current price of $39.69 is above the 20 and 60 day moving averages, this would not be considered a sudden or extreme price movement (such as a sharp uptrend or downturn), based on the provided data.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue. There's no consistent trend easily discernible.  For instance, comparing Q4 2024 to Q3 2024 showcases a dramatic shift from a substantial loss to a considerable profit, highlighting the erratic nature of the company's financial performance.  Further investigation into the causes of these fluctuations is needed to fully interpret the results.  Direct comparison to expectations is impossible without those figures.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has remained relatively flat over the past five quarters around $0.09B.  Profit margins, however, are consistently high and show a slight upward trend.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown a slight downward trend.  ROE is consistently negative, indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity.  This is a significant concern and needs further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided in the initial prompt.  Therefore, no analysis can be performed in this section.  Information on recent market outlook is also needed.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai's performance has been volatile, with significant swings in earnings and a generally negative ROE. While revenue is relatively stable, the highly fluctuating EPS raises concerns. The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed but the technical indicators paint a somewhat mixed picture.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more complete assessment. Further investigation into the underlying causes for the volatile EPS and negative ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions. The significant fluctuations in revenue and EPS across quarters, along with the negative ROE, present significant risk.  The consistently high profit margins are a positive, but they are not enough to offset the negative aspects.
