**1) Return Rate Comparison (AI vs. VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** C3.ai Inc. is an enterprise AI software company.
*   **AI Cumulative Return:** -44.63%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 45.95%
*   **Divergence:** -90.58

**Analysis:** C3.ai has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period examined.  The divergence is substantial (-90.58), indicating a very large gap between the returns. The relative divergence of 1.6 suggests that the current divergence is near the bottom of its historical range.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|--------|------|--------|
| 2021-2023  | 6.0%  | 43.0% | 5.0%   | 2.2  | 4.1    |
| 2022-2024  | 59.0% | 41.5% | 40.0%  | 2.2  | 4.9    |
| 2023-2025  | -9.0% | 53.2% | -71.0% | 2.3  | 1.9    |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The CAGR shows significant variability. 2022-2024 saw substantial growth, while 2023-2025 experienced a decline.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Drawdowns are consistently high, indicating significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha fluctuates dramatically, being strongly positive in 2022-2024 but deeply negative in 2023-2025, suggesting inconsistent outperformance.
*   **Beta:** A beta consistently above 2 indicates that C3.ai's stock price is more volatile than the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market cap dropped significantly from 4.9B to 1.9B from 2022-2025, possibly due to the poor stock performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 13.75
*   **Last Market Data:** Price 13.90, Previous Close 13.75, Change: 1.09%
*   **5-day SMA:** 13.798
*   **20-day SMA:** 14.5985
*   **60-day SMA:** 15.6837

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day).  This *generally* suggests a short-term downtrend.  The 5-day SMA is close to the current price, while the 20-day and 60-day are higher, further reinforcing the downtrend idea. The positive change in the last market data shows the market rebounded slightly at close.

**3) RSI, PPO, Divergence, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 25.62 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.42
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Very Safe - MRI:0.90), Monthly investment of 1.6%
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** 1.6 (+) - Short-term increase
*   **Expected Return:** -933.6%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests a moderate level of risk and potential reward.
*   **RSI:** The RSI indicates that the stock is currently oversold, which *could* suggest a potential for a price rebound.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO indicates the price is below the moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 100%" signal (with high MRI) seems contradictory to the very low expected return and the negative historical performance.  This signal should be viewed cautiously and in the context of the overall analysis.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward movement relative to VOO.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return of -933.6% is highly concerning and should be interpreted as a potential for significant losses if the stock continues its current trajectory.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

The news headlines present a mixed picture:

*   **Positive:** Articles suggest AI stocks should be owned, highlight potential buying opportunities, and mention insider buying.
*   **Negative:** One article warns about inflation disrupting the AI stock rally.

**Analysis:**  The news is a mix of bullish and bearish sentiment. The insider buying is a potentially positive sign, suggesting that those with the most knowledge about the company believe the stock is undervalued. However, the inflation warning is a significant risk factor.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Not Available (Indicated by "-")
*   **Opinions:** 12
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 14.67 / 24.00 / 8.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:**  No specific changes provided.

**Analysis:** The analyst target prices show a wide range, indicating uncertainty about the stock's future performance. The average target price ($14.67) is slightly above the current price, suggesting a modest potential upside according to analysts, but the low target of $8.00 indicates significant downside risk.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

C3.ai Inc. presents a very mixed and concerning picture.

*   **Poor Performance:** The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data provided, C3.ai appears to be a high-risk investment. While there might be short-term trading opportunities due to the oversold condition and recent positive divergence, the long-term outlook is uncertain, and the negative ROE and extremely low expected return are significant red flags. Investors should exercise extreme caution and conduct thorough due diligence before considering an investment in C3.ai. The "Buy" hybrid signal seems to be based on the very safe algorithm, not on the solid figures.
