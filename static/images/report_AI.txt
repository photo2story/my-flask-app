    *   **CAGR:** Shows inconsistent growth, with positive returns in 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 but a negative return in 2023-2025.
    *   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  Reflects significant risk, with MDDs consistently above 40%, indicating substantial potential losses.
    *   **Alpha:** Significantly negative alpha in 2023-2025 indicates severe underperformance relative to the market.
    *   **Beta:** High Beta values (around 2.2-2.3) suggests the stock is much more volatile than the market.  This means it tends to amplify market movements, both up and down.

    *   60-day SMA: \$15.68

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently showing an upward move, but the current price is below all the SMAs. The 5-day SMA is the closest to the current price, while the 60-day SMA is significantly higher. This indicates that the stock is in a downtrend, but may have short-term upward momentum.

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.6 (+): 단기상승 (short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -933.6%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a medium investment risk level.
    *   The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity as the price may rebound.
    *   The PPO is negative, indicating the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming a downtrend.
    *   The Hybrid Signal indicates a 100% buy recommendation, but is based on the data from 2025-12-01 with a high MRI of 0.9. This means that this Hybrid Signal may not be reflective of the current MRI.
    *   The recent relative divergence change shows short-term rise.
    *   The exceptionally low expected return of -933.6% is a significant concern.

    *   **Analysis:** Equity is decreasing slightly. ROE (Return on Equity) is negative, which means the company is not generating profits from shareholder investments.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Summary:**  C3.ai's stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The technical indicators suggest a downtrend, though the RSI indicates the stock may be oversold. Recent news is very positive, potentially driven by a broader positive outlook for AI. Analyst target prices are above the current price, which suggest upside potential. The company's financial performance is mixed. While revenue fluctuates, and ROE is negative, it has high profit margins. Beta value of 2.2-2.3 indicates the stock is much more volatile than the market.
*   **Key Considerations:**
    *   **High Volatility:** The high beta indicates the stock is subject to significant price swings.
    *   **Negative ROE:**  The consistent negative ROE is a concerning signal about the company's profitability.
    *   **Positive News Sentiment:** Recent positive news and insider buying may signal a turnaround.
    *   **Technical Indicators:**  The oversold RSI and a potential short-term upward divergence could signal a buying opportunity for risk-tolerant investors.
    *   **Extremely Low Expected Return:** The expected return is a major red flag.
*   **Conclusion:**
    C3.ai presents a very mixed picture. The stock is clearly high-risk, with significant past underperformance and negative ROE. However, recent positive news and oversold conditions could suggest a potential speculative buying opportunity for investors with high-risk tolerance and a strong belief in the long-term potential of AI. **However, the extraordinarily low expected return suggests caution is warranted.** More information and due diligence are needed before making any investment decisions.
