**0. Key Figures Summary:**

C3.ai Inc. is a provider of enterprise AI software.  The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly over the analyzed period. While showing recent positive growth, it remains volatile and requires careful consideration.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

C3.ai's cumulative return is 18.99%, while the S&P 500's is 36.91%. This results in a difference of -17.9%, placing it at the 35.4th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-66.3% to 70.3%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals high volatility and varying performance across different periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $32.91
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $33.19
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $32.78
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $34.94

The price is currently below its 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend, while the 20-day average suggests a more neutral stance.  The recent price increase of $1.26 (from the previous close) indicates a potential short-term bullish signal, but the position below the 60-day average might negate this for the longer term.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 50.32 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.40 (Positive, suggesting potential upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -2.6% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -41.1% (Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term).  This large negative value warrants further investigation into the underlying assumptions.

The recent price change ($1.26) is relatively small and doesn't significantly impact the analysis, though it does signal some potential short-term volatility.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in EPS, with both substantial profits and losses in recent quarters. Revenue remains relatively stable, hovering around $6.5B-$7.27B.  Further investigation is needed to understand the causes of these EPS fluctuations.

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains relatively consistent quarter-over-quarter, though there's a slight downward trend in recent quarters. Profit margins are high, but the ROE is consistently negative, indicating a problem with the company's return on invested capital, despite the high profit margin.  This negative ROE needs further investigation to understand the underlying causes.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai exhibits high growth potential, indicated by the high revenue, and high profit margins. However, the inconsistent earnings, negative ROE, and significant underperformance against the S&P 500 raise significant concerns. The high volatility and Beta suggest significant risk.  The negative long-term expected return compared to the S&P 500 is a major red flag.  Further due diligence is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Investigating the reasons behind the negative ROE and volatile EPS is paramount.  The provided data suggests a high-risk, high-reward scenario with a currently negative outlook compared to a benchmark index.
