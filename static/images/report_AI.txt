* **20-Day Moving Average:** $34.66
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $32.95

The price is currently below both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The 5-day moving average being closer to the current price indicates some potential short-term stabilization.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (29.78):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a price rebound.
* **PPO (-1.66):**  A negative PPO value suggests bearish momentum.

* **Expected Return (-89.1%):** This alarmingly negative expected return, relative to the S&P 500, over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon suggests significant downside risk. This necessitates caution. The current price of $32.01, considering the negative expected return, does not indicate a significant immediate price change, either up or down. There is no evidence of a rapid price surge or drop.

The data also contains a duplicate entry for 2024-11-07.  Data inconsistencies should be verified.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai exhibits high volatility and significant underperformance against the S&P 500.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO, consistently negative ROE, and dramatically negative expected return paint a bearish picture.  The volatile earnings data and inconsistencies require further investigation.  The high beta underscores its sensitivity to market fluctuations.  Currently, a long-term investment in C3.ai carries substantial risk.  More detailed fundamental analysis, including a thorough investigation into the reasons for revenue fluctuations and the consistent negative ROE, is necessary before making any investment decisions.
