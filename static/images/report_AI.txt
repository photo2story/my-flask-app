|------------|--------|-------|---------|--------|--------|

| 2023-2025  | -7.0% | 82.8% | -75.0% | 0.0   | 2.0    |

*   **Analysis of Alpha/Beta:**
    *   **CAGR:** Highly volatile. CAGR has fluctuated wildly, from large negative numbers to significant positive returns, indicating inconsistent performance.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, suggesting significant risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is also highly volatile, frequently negative, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark, which has stabilized over the past several years.
    *   **Beta:** Beta is close to 0, suggesting a weak correlation with the market (S&P 500). This is unusual since the company is in the technology sector which is usually more correlated to the S&P500.
    *   **Cap:** Market capitalization has been inconsistent, fluctuating over time.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   Current Close: $13.99

*   5-day SMA: $14.22
*   20-day SMA: $14.76
*   60-day SMA: $16.03

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend. The "Last Market" data shows a slight decrease in the most recent trading day.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   MRI: 1.0 (High Investment Recommended) - **Important Note:** This is a contrarian signal given the other data and the news headlines.
*   RSI: 38.95 (Approaching Oversold)
*   PPO: -0.33 (Bearish Trend)
*   Hybrid Signal: Buy 100% of cash (69 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90). Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00).
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: -2.3 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   Expected Return: -1418.0% (Significantly Negative)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests high investment based on this particular model.  However, given other bearish indicators, this should be viewed with caution. The RSI is approaching oversold territory, which could suggest a potential bounce, but further confirmation is needed.
    *   The PPO indicates a bearish trend.
    *   The 20-day relative divergence change confirms a recent short-term decline.
    *   The extremely negative expected return suggests that the model anticipates significant further underperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events (Yahoo Finance):**

*   The news headlines are a mixed bag, but generally lean negative to neutral:
    *   Several articles question whether AI stock have better upside.
    *   One article directly warns about avoiding AI stocks for retirement.
    *   Several articles suggest looking at "cheaper" AI stocks for 2026, implying C3.ai is not among them.
    *   The headlines mention other AI companies (Palantir, Datavault AI, Microsoft, Oracle) for comparison, suggesting a competitive landscape.

*   **Analysis:** The news sentiment is lukewarm. While there is general interest in AI stocks, specific articles caution against C3.ai, mention competitors and highlight risks.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions:**

*   Consensus: Hold (Mean: 3.43)
*   Target Price: Avg: $14.67 / High: $24.00 / Low: $8.00
*   Recent Rating Changes: No information available ( → ())

*   **Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold," suggesting a neutral outlook. The average target price is slightly above the current price, but the wide range between high and low targets indicates significant uncertainty.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-11-05 | 0.94 | 6.35 B$    |
| 2025-08-07 | 2    | 7.09 B$    |
| 2025-05-02 | 1.18 | 6.78 B$    |
| 2024-11-07 | 0.72 | 6.75 B$    |
| 2025-11-05 | 0.72 | 6.75 B$    |

*   **Analysis:** EPS and Revenue numbers fluctuate, showing some volatility. However, it is unclear if this is truly the correct data. In 2025-11-05, both 0.94 and 0.72 for EPS seem problematic, and so do the revenue numbers. If these were in millions, then these would be feasible numbers; but with the B$ notation, it is unlikely.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

C3.ai exhibits several concerning signals:

*   **Significant Underperformance:**  It has dramatically underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **High Volatility & Risk:**  The stock demonstrates high volatility and significant drawdown risk.
*   **Bearish Momentum:**  Recent price action and technical indicators (PPO, divergence change) suggest a downtrend.
*   **Mixed News Sentiment:**  While interest in AI is high, news specifically about C3.ai is mixed and includes cautions.
*   **Decreasing Financial Health:** Decreasing equity and negative ROE figures are concerning.
*   **Inconsistent financial reporting:** There appears to be some error in the most recent reporting of financials.

**Overall Recommendation:** While the analyst consensus is "Hold" and the MRI signals a "Buy," the preponderance of evidence suggests caution. The company is facing significant challenges and has underperformed significantly. A high-risk tolerance and thorough due diligence are required before considering any investment. The significantly negative expected return should also be a major red flag for any investor.
