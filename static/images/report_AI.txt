**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Highly variable, ranging from negative to positive returns depending on the period.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown values indicate significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha fluctuates significantly, indicating inconsistent outperformance relative to the market.  The most recent period (2023-2025) shows a strongly negative alpha.
*   **Beta:** Beta is near zero, suggesting C3.ai's price movements are largely independent of the overall market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement:**

*   **Current Price:** 18.23
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 17.95, Previous Close: 17.56, Change: 2.22% (Indicates a positive movement from the previous close)
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 18.34
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 18.31
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 18.41

**Analysis:** The stock price is slightly below all three moving averages. The recent market data suggest a rebound from the previous day's close, but the overall trend based on moving averages appears slightly downward.

**3. Indicators and Signals:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 54.29 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.18 (Slightly bearish, indicating the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash 0% Buy 100% of cash (57 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.7% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Delta Relative Divergence (20-day):** -2.9 (Short-term decrease in relative divergence, suggesting recent underperformance compared to VOO)
*   **Expected Return:** -378% (Significant underperformance expected relative to S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon)

**Analysis:** Despite a high MRI, the negative PPO and decreasing relative divergence suggest caution.  The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag. The recommendation to buy with 100% cash may be driven by the high MRI, but should be carefully considered in light of the other negative indicators. The price movement of 2.22% from the previous close indicates a short-term positive change.
