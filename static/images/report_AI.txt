2024-11-25 - Analysis Report
## C3.ai Inc. (AI) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

C3.ai Inc. (AI) is a provider of enterprise AI software.  Over the period analyzed, its cumulative return (20.59%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) return of 65.94%. The difference is -45.35%, placing it at the 39.52 percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500.  This indicates AI's underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided CAGR figures show significant negative returns in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023, while 2022-2024 shows a positive return, but still lower than the S&P 500.  The high Beta values (1.9 to 4.3) across the periods suggest high volatility and sensitivity to market movements.  The positive Alpha suggests potential outperformance, but this is mitigated by the overwhelmingly negative CAGR and significant maximum drawdown (MDD).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Close:** $37.42 (Last Market: $39.42)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $32.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $28.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $25.38

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting potential upward momentum, but the recent closing price drop from the last market price of $39.42 signals a potential short-term reversal or consolidation.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 83.93 - This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback is likely.
* **PPO:** 3.4 - A positive PPO suggests upward momentum, but the high RSI value counteracts this.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +24.84 - This shows a recent increase in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The provided expected return of 0% suggests no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is predicted for long-term (2+ years) buy-and-hold investors, which conflicts with the historical alpha data. This requires further investigation and consideration of multiple factors.
* **Price Drop from $39.42:** The drop from $39.42 might be a short-term correction after a brief upward surge, rather than a sharp decline.  More data is needed to confirm.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show significant volatility.  While some quarters show positive EPS and high revenue (e.g., 2024-05-02), others reveal substantial losses (e.g., 2024-08-01).  The most recent report (2024-11-07) shows positive EPS, but a comparison with analyst expectations is crucial for a complete assessment.  Further analysis of the variance in revenue is required to determine trends and drivers.


**5. Quarterly Financial Data Analysis (Revenue and Profitability & Capital and Profitability):**

The data shows relatively consistent revenue around $0.07B-$0.09B. However, the Profit Margin hovers between 56% and 59%, showing relatively strong profitability despite the negative ROE.  The consistently negative Return on Equity (ROE) across all quarters warrants significant concern.  This indicates the company is not generating sufficient returns on its invested capital, suggesting underlying issues with profitability. This is a critical area needing detailed investigation.



**7. News and Recent Issues:**

*(This section requires up-to-date information from sources like Shacknews and Finbold to provide an accurate assessment of recent news, analyst opinions, and market outlook.  Please provide current news articles for a complete analysis.)*  Lack of this data limits the ability to assess the impact of recent events on the stock price.


**8. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai exhibits high volatility and significant swings in performance. While some metrics (positive Alpha, recent price increase above moving averages, positive 20-day relative divergence) suggest potential, the overwhelmingly negative CAGR, significant MDD, overbought RSI, and consistently negative ROE raise considerable concerns.  The lack of consistent profitability, coupled with the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500,  presents a high-risk investment profile.  The recent price drop requires further observation. A deeper dive into the latest earnings reports (including analyst expectations), news impacting the company, and a more comprehensive technical analysis are necessary for a more informed investment decision.   The positive Alpha should be critically assessed in light of the much larger negative CAGR.
