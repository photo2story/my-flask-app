The difference is -48.5%, placing it at the 25.6th percentile of historical divergence relative to the S&P 500. This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $31.65
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $32.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $33.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $33.79

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend. The recent price drop of $1.35 (4.09%) further reinforces this.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (35.88):** Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce is due. However, further confirmation is needed.
* **PPO (-0.2774):** Shows a negative value, confirming the downtrend.
* **Relative Divergence:**  A recent decrease of -3.5 points in relative divergence over 20 days indicates a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (-96.7%):** The extremely negative expected return highlights significant risk.  This dramatic figure needs further investigation to determine its basis and plausibility.  The extremely negative expected return strongly suggests significant uncertainty and potential for further losses, especially when compared to the potentially positive long-term outlook of the S&P 500.  Long-term (2+ years) investment requires careful consideration given this outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There is a clear inconsistency in reported data. For example, 2024-11-07 shows two different entries, one with a positive EPS of 0.72 and a second with a positive EPS of 2.83. This inconsistency requires clarification and verification from reliable sources.  Further analysis is needed to determine a meaningful trend, considering the apparent inconsistencies and non-consecutive quarterly reports.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively flat at ~$0.09B for the last four quarters. Profit margins are high (56-61%), but the dataset seems to lack revenue data consistency.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable around $0.87B. ROE is consistently negative (-7% to -8%), indicating the company is not generating returns on its equity.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

C3.ai is currently experiencing significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  The stock price is trending downward, although oversold conditions according to the RSI suggest a potential bounce.  However, the overwhelmingly negative expected return and inconsistent earnings data raise serious concerns. Negative ROE and the apparent data inconsistencies in the provided financial information raise further questions concerning the long-term financial health and prospects of the company.   Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence, including verification of the provided data, is crucial.  The high profit margin is noteworthy, but only a part of a full analysis needed to form an opinion on the long-term viability of the company.   Investors should proceed with extreme caution.

**8. Disclaimer:** This analysis is based solely on the provided data and does not constitute financial advice.  Independent research and consultation with a financial advisor are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
