This report analyzes Shift4 Payments Inc., a provider of integrated payment processing solutions.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Shift4 Payments (FOUR) has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for FOUR is 98.86%, while VOO's is 82.90%. This represents a difference of 15.96%.  The relative divergence (57.3%) indicates FOUR's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals interesting trends:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) | Notes                                    |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| 2020-2022  | 4.0% | 23.9% | -12.0% | 0.1 | 5.1 | Negative alpha, high beta.                |
| 2021-2023  | -12.0% | 23.9% | -36.0% | 0.2 | 6.8 | Significant underperformance, high beta.   |
| 2022-2024  | 86.0% | 23.9% | -0.2 | 9.5 |     | Strong performance, extremely high beta. |
| 2023-2025  | 79.0% | 18.5% | 2.4 | 10.9 |     | Strong performance, high beta, positive alpha. |

Noteworthy is the significant increase in beta over time, indicating increasing sensitivity to market movements.  The recent positive alpha suggests outperformance relative to the market.  However, the high beta exposes the stock to higher risk.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $119.39
* **Last Market Price:** $121.28 (1.58% increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $119.41
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $117.64
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $109.20

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a positive short-term trend.  The recent price increase of 1.58% indicates a potential short-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 55.06 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.42 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -1.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -16.7% (Expected to underperform S&P 500 over the long term)

The contradictory signals (positive price movement, but negative PPO and relative divergence) suggest caution. The negative expected return, however, needs further investigation into the methodology.  The large price change of the last day (1.58%) suggests potential short term volatility and shouldn't be over interpreted without additional context.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Expected EPS | Difference |
|------------|--------|--------------|------------|
| 2024-11-12 | 1.04   | 1.06         | -0.02      |
| 2024-08-08 | 0.96   | 0.91         | +0.05      |
| 2024-05-09 | 0.54   | 0.62         | -0.08      |
| 2024-02-27 | 0.76   | 0.82         | -0.06      |
| 2023-11-08 | 0.82   | 0.7          | +0.12      |

Earnings have been somewhat volatile, with some quarters exceeding expectations and others falling short.  A more detailed analysis, considering revenue and other factors, would be needed for a complete picture.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Shift4 Payments shows strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500, particularly in the last year.  However, this comes with significant beta (high volatility), and the predicted long-term underperformance against the S&P 500 raises concerns.  Recent price action is positive, but technical indicators provide mixed signals. Earnings have been volatile, and a deeper dive into the financial statements is required.  Further research is necessary to determine if the current valuation is justified given the high beta and long-term expected underperformance.  Investors should carefully consider risk tolerance before investing.
