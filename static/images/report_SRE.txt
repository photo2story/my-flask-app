*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts have a generally positive outlook, but the target price suggests limited upside.
*   **Financials:**  Revenue, EPS, and ROE are volatile. Profit margins are relatively stable and high. Equity is increasing.
*   **Risk:** MRI indicates low market risk, however, very high beta(2.9) during 2023~2025 period means high volatility.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The model's extremely negative expected return is a major red flag.

**Conclusion:**

Sempra shows a mixed outlook. Recent price action and analyst ratings are mildly positive. However, underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and a negative expected return suggest caution. Further investigation into the drivers of the negative expected return and the company's future growth prospects is warranted before making an investment decision. Recent news about the LNG deal is a potential positive catalyst, but the underperformance compared to the utility sector remains a concern.
