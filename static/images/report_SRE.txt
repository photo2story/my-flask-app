* **Closing Price:** $83.99
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $80.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $84.84

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.18 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.44 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +1.4 (Suggests a recent short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -98.6% (This extremely negative figure suggests a significant underperformance expectation compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years).  This needs further investigation as it's highly improbable and might stem from a flawed calculation or inaccurate assumptions.)

The current price of $83.99 is relatively close to the 20-day moving average, indicating neither a significant recent uptrend nor a strong downtrend. The extremely negative expected return warrants closer examination of the model and underlying assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's a potential data error as the 2024-11-06 entry appears twice.  A more consistent analysis requires clearer data and potentially more quarters to establish reliable trends.  Without addressing data inconsistencies, concluding meaningful insights on trends is unreliable.


**5. Financial Information (Revenue and Profitability):**

Revenue shows some fluctuation, but generally remains high, indicating a relatively stable business.  Profit margins are consistently high (40-46%), demonstrating strong profitability.


**6. Financial Information (Capital and Profitability):**

Equity is steadily increasing, indicating financial health.  ROE shows some variation, generally remaining between 2% and 3%.  This indicates a solid but not exceptional return on equity.


**7. Overall Analysis Summary:**

Sempra (SRE) exhibits strong profitability and a relatively stable revenue stream, as indicated by financial statements. However, its stock price performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  Technical indicators suggest a relatively neutral to slightly bearish outlook in the short-term. The extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 requires additional investigation to determine its validity.  Further analysis is needed to assess the consistency and reliability of the provided earnings data and to clarify the calculation of the drastically negative expected return.  The historically high variability in annual performance metrics (CAGR and MDD) suggests higher-than-average risk.  Investors should carefully assess their risk tolerance and investment horizon before making any decisions.
