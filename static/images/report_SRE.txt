## Sempra (SRE) Stock Report

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Sempra (SRE) is an American energy company that operates primarily in California.  The cumulative return of SRE (58.22%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (122.83%). The difference is -64.6%, placing it at the 9.3rd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta â‰ˆ 0.1 consistently indicates low market correlation). While some periods exhibit strong CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), others show significant maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The relatively consistent alpha of 0.1 suggests some degree of outperformance, but this is overshadowed by the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the entire observation period.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $82.81
* **5-day Moving Average:** $84.26
* **20-day Moving Average:** $84.47
* **60-day Moving Average:** $87.35

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downward trend.  The very slight positive change from the previous close is insignificant in the context of the broader trends.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (40.24):**  Approaching oversold territory (generally considered below 30), suggesting potential for a bounce, but not a strong buy signal.
* **PPO (0.24):** Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but the low value suggests this momentum is weak.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (-6.2):**  Shows a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (-237.1%):** This extremely negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is highly concerning and needs further investigation to determine the validity of this projection. The small positive price change from the previous day is irrelevant given this projected long-term return.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicate entries.  A more accurate and complete dataset is needed for a reliable analysis. The apparent fluctuation in EPS and revenue doesn't show a clear trend.  Further investigation into the data discrepancies is crucial.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.01 | $2.57B       |
| 2024-08-06 | 1.13 | $2.48B       |
| 2024-05-07 | 1.27 | $3.70B       |
| 2023-11-03 | 1.14 | $2.89B       |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.14 | $2.89B       |

ROE (Return on Equity) is consistently around 2.5%, indicating moderate profitability.  The equity has been steadily increasing.


| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity     | ROE   |
|-------------|------------|---------------|------------|-------|
| 2024-09-30  | $2.78B     | 44.49%        | $29.72B    | 2.18% |
| 2024-06-30  | $3.01B     | 44.20%        | $29.50B    | 2.46% |
| 2024-03-31  | $3.64B     | 46.04%        | $29.16B    | 2.79% |
| 2023-12-31  | $3.49B     | 40.79%        | $28.70B    | 2.61% |
| 2023-09-30  | $3.33B     | 40.34%        | $28.26B    | 2.59% |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) shows mixed signals. While the financials appear relatively stable, with strong profit margins and growing equity, the stock's performance significantly lags behind the S&P 500.  The negative long-term expected return is a major red flag and requires careful consideration. Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce but no strong bullish signal. The inconsistent and incomplete earnings data prevents a thorough assessment of the company's operational performance.  Further investigation into the data inconsistencies and the extremely negative expected return projection is warranted before making any investment decisions.  The low beta suggests low correlation with the market, offering potential diversification benefits, but the negative alpha and underperformance relative to the market remain significant concerns.
