The data shows significant volatility in both CAGR and Alpha, suggesting periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market (Beta is generally low to moderate).  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values highlight the risk associated with SRE.  Further investigation into the drivers of these fluctuations is warranted.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $70.73
* **Previous Close:** $72.84
* **Change:** -$2.11 (A -2.9% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $71.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $76.59

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent decline of -2.9% warrants further investigation into potential contributing factors.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 54.75 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.92 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +6.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -96.3% (This extremely negative figure requires clarification.  It's likely an error or needs further context.  It cannot be interpreted literally.)

The price drop of -2.9% is relatively modest and not indicative of a drastic, sudden market movement (e.g., a "flash crash"). The conflicting signals from the indicators require further analysis before drawing definitive conclusions.  The extremely low expected return warrants immediate attention and clarification.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.01  | $2.57 B       |
| 2024-08-06 | 1.13  | $2.48 B       |
| 2024-05-07 | 1.27  | $3.70 B       |
| 2023-11-03 | 1.14  | $2.89 B       |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.14  | $2.89 B       | *(Note: Duplicate entry.  Likely a data error.)*


Earnings show some volatility.  A deeper dive into the underlying reasons for the fluctuations in both EPS and revenue is necessary, accounting for any potential seasonality and external factors.  The duplicate entry at 2024-11-06 needs correction.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some short-term indicators suggest a potential upward trend, the overall picture is mixed.  The recent price drop and the highly negative (and likely erroneous) expected return are major concerns.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of the underperformance, particularly the significant volatility in earnings and the questionable -96.3% expected return figure. A thorough review of the data quality, especially the duplicate earnings entry, is crucial before forming any definitive investment conclusions.  The relatively low beta suggests lower market correlation, but the high MDD values point to potentially high risk.  Additional fundamental analysis, considering the company's business model, regulatory environment, and future growth prospects, is strongly recommended.
