* **20-day Moving Average:** $69.15
* **60-day Moving Average:** $75.00

The price is slightly above the 20-day moving average, suggesting a moderately bullish short-term trend. However, it is significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend in the medium term.

* **RSI:** 51.34 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.3365 (Slightly positive momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.6 (Short-term bearish signal)
* **Expected Return:** -159.2% (This extremely negative figure needs clarification.  It likely represents a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 projection over a longer time frame and not a prediction of actual price movement).  The high negative expected return raises concerns.

The combination of a high MRI, negative relative divergence change, and the extremely negative expected return suggests caution. The recent price jump requires further investigation to determine if it represents a sustainable trend or a temporary fluctuation.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Sempra (SRE) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While recent financial information suggests healthy profit margins,  the negative expected return (-159.2%), high market risk indicator, and negative short-term divergence signals raise considerable caution.  The recent price jump needs further analysis to determine if it is sustainable. A deeper dive into the reasons for SRE's underperformance relative to the market and a more thorough examination of long-term growth prospects and risk factors are crucial before making any investment decisions. The provided data suggests a high-risk investment, and further due diligence is strongly recommended.  The exceptionally negative expected return figure needs to be investigated and clarified.
