**2. Recent Price Action:**

The current price ($64.59) is below all three moving averages (5-day: $69.12, 20-day: $69.53, 60-day: $76.01), suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price increase (Last-market) is relatively small and is not sufficient to reverse the overall trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 33.93 indicates the stock is potentially oversold, suggesting a possible bounce. However, the negative PPO (-0.09) and high MRI (0.49) point to bearish momentum and high risk, respectively. The recent positive relative divergence (8.5%) signals a potential short-term upward trend; however, this should be considered in conjunction with the overall negative trend.  The expected return of -117.4% is extremely negative and needs further investigation to determine its validity and timeframe.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) currently shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While some technical indicators (RSI) suggest potential oversold conditions, bearish momentum and high market risk are significant concerns. The company's financial performance shows strong profitability and consistent equity growth but needs a more thorough analysis of earnings and future projections.  The extremely negative expected return (-117.4%) needs further scrutiny to understand the methodology and assumptions behind it.  Before making any investment decision, further investigation into the reasons for underperformance, including competitive pressures, regulatory changes, or specific project risks, is crucial.  The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity, meaning returns will likely be highly correlated to broader market movements.  Given the current data, a long-term investment in SRE carries considerable risk.
