* **60-Day Moving Average:** $86.27

* **PPO (-1.00):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.

* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided data suggests no significant expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is a crucial point to consider for long-term investors.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates but doesn't show a clear consistent upward trend.  There was a significant jump in Q2 2024 ($3.70B), followed by a drop in subsequent quarters.
* **EPS:** EPS also shows volatility, reaching a high of $1.27 in Q2 2024, followed by a decrease in subsequent quarters.  Note the duplicate entry for 2024-11-06. This inconsistency requires further clarification from the source data.
* **Overall:** No clear pattern emerges from the limited data.  To assess performance effectively, a comparison with analyst expectations would be necessary (not provided).


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuation; profit margins are relatively stable around 40-46%, except for a dip in Q4 2023.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has steadily increased; ROE shows slight fluctuations but remains consistently above 2%.

The financial information indicates a generally healthy financial position, with consistent profitability and steady equity growth.  However, more comprehensive financial ratios would provide a more robust analysis.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook is provided. Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also absent.  This significantly limits the scope of the analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

SRE is currently underperforming the S&P 500, showing a significant lag in cumulative returns. While some technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term rebound (oversold RSI), the overall trend appears bearish, supported by negative PPO and downward moving averages. Recent earnings show volatility in both revenue and EPS, preventing clear conclusions without additional context (analyst expectations, industry comparisons).  The financial statements indicate a fundamentally sound company, but the underperformance against the market benchmark and the lack of external information necessitate caution.  The provided expectation of 0% return relative to the S&P 500 suggests that SRE, based solely on this data, presents no significant advantage for long-term investment compared to a broad market index fund.  Further investigation into the reasons for underperformance and a broader review of analyst expectations are needed before reaching a conclusive investment recommendation.
