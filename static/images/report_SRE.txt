Despite some positive short-term signals and analyst sentiment, the long-term outlook for Sempra appears uncertain, based on the data provided, particularly with the highly negative expected return and historical underperformance. The news of institutional investors selling shares adds a layer of caution. Potential investors should carefully weigh these risks against any potential upside.
