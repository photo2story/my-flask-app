*   **Concerns:**
    *   Regulatory impact (CPUC ruling) needs further investigation.

Sempra appears to be a *high-risk, potentially high-reward* investment at this point. The extremely negative expected return and recent financial performance issues are significant red flags. However, the oversold RSI and positive analyst sentiment suggest a possible short-term recovery. *Careful due diligence is essential before considering an investment.* Understanding the factors driving the negative expected return, the CPUC ruling, and the reasons behind the decline in profit margins and ROE are crucial. Proceed with caution.
