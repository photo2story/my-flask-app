*   **RSI:** 39.57 (Approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a possible bounce)

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -3.8 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -241.1 (Very negative, indicating a highly pessimistic outlook compared to the S&P 500)

**Analysis:** Despite a "High Investment Recommended" signal from the MRI, the RSI suggests the stock is approaching oversold levels. The negative PPO and a recent short-term decline in relative divergence further support this.  The Hybrid Signal recommends buying. The extremely negative Expected Return indicates significant underperformance is anticipated.
