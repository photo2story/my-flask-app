### 7. Overall Summary

Sempra (SRE) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While the recent stock price has shown a short-term upward trend, driven by positive news flow, the company's historical performance, high volatility, and a large negative expected return should be considered carefully. The high beta value of the 2023-2025 period, along with the significantly negative alpha, suggests that the stock has been highly volatile and underperforming relative to its benchmark. The company's financial performance is mixed, with fluctuating revenues, relatively stable profit margins, and increasing equity. Given the current technical indicators and the cautious hybrid signal, a strategic approach would be to consider holding a small position while closely monitoring company-specific news, industry trends, and broader economic factors.
