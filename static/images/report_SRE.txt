The high beta values consistently suggest SRE's price movements are significantly more volatile than the overall market.  The inconsistent alpha indicates that SRE's performance hasn't consistently exceeded or underperformed the market's risk-adjusted returns.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $71.56
* **Last Market Price:** $72.42 (+$1.2 increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $70.696
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.7201
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $77.0428

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential downward trend in the medium term.  The recent increase of $1.2 suggests a minor uptick, not a substantial 급반등 (sharp rebound).

* **RSI:** 63.24 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.91 (Positive; indicates bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +7.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -120.8% (This extremely negative value needs clarification. It likely represents a projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon, considering current conditions and historical context)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's a need for further analysis to understand the reasons behind these fluctuations (seasonal factors, one-off events, etc.).  Note the duplicate entry for 2024-11-06. Data needs correction.


| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출        |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.01  | 2.57 B$     |
| 2024-08-06 | 1.13  | 2.48 B$     |
| 2024-05-07 | 1.27  | 3.70 B$     |
| 2023-11-03 | 1.14  | 2.89 B$     |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.14  | 2.89 B$     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is relatively consistent, with profit margins hovering around 44-49%.  Equity is steadily increasing. ROE shows some fluctuation but remains relatively stable around 2%.  Further analysis is needed to determine if these are healthy trends for the company.

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity     | ROE    |
|-------------|------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $3.76B     | 49.23%        | $31.24B    | 2.16%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $2.78B     | 44.49%        | $29.72B    | 2.18%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $3.01B     | 44.20%        | $29.50B    | 2.46%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.64B     | 46.04%        | $29.16B    | 2.79%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.49B     | 40.79%        | $28.70B    | 2.61%  |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

SRE has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some short-term indicators suggest upward momentum, the long-term outlook appears uncertain. The high beta indicates high volatility.  The negative expected return (-120.8%) requires clarification and further investigation into its calculation and assumptions.  A thorough analysis of earnings data and financial statements, along with a deeper understanding of the company's strategic direction and industry outlook, is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The inconsistent earnings and the -120.8% expected return should raise significant concerns for potential investors.  Data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) further weaken the reliability of this analysis and highlight the need for better data quality.
