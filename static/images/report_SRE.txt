* **5-Day Moving Average:** $66.19
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.22

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend.  The recent price increase of 2.11% (from $66.90) may be a temporary bounce.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.74 (approaching oversold territory)
* **PPO:** 0.05 (slightly positive, suggesting a weak bullish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -7.4% (short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -191.8% (This extremely negative value needs further clarification. It seems unlikely and should be investigated.  The methodology for calculating this should be reviewed.)  The change in price suggests a recent price bounce but long-term prospects compared to S&P 500 seem weak.

The combination of a high MRI, a relatively low RSI near oversold levels and a negative relative strength change suggests caution.  The extremely negative long-term expected return requires further scrutiny.

Before making any investment decision, a thorough review of the -191.8% expected return calculation is crucial.  Further research into the company's future prospects and the assumptions used in the expected return calculation is strongly recommended.  Currently, the data suggests a bearish outlook, but more in-depth analysis is necessary.
