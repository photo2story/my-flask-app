* **Closing Price:** $87.10
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $85.43
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $83.24
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $85.84

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.  The recent increase (1.27%) from the previous close indicates a possible short-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 73.67 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term correction.)
* **PPO:** 0.75 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum.)
* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** +11.2% (Short-term upward trend.)
* **Expected Return (vs S&P 500, long-term):** -78.0% (This significantly negative expected return requires careful consideration.  The substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 needs further investigation.)  This -78% figure suggests that even over a long-term horizon (2+ years), the projection is for SRE to underperform the S&P500 significantly.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) shows a mixed picture. While it boasts high profit margins and growing equity, its performance significantly lags the S&P 500, a considerable concern.  Technical indicators suggest short-term bullish momentum, but the RSI is nearing overbought levels, hinting at a potential correction. The projected long-term underperformance (-78%) relative to the S&P 500 is a major negative.  Earnings and revenue show volatility, and a thorough analysis of the underlying reasons for the underperformance relative to the market is crucial before any investment decision.  Further investigation into the company's strategy, competitive landscape, and potential catalysts for future growth is necessary to assess the long-term viability of SRE as an investment.  The -78% expected return specifically needs deeper exploration to understand the basis of this prediction.
