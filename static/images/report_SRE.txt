## Sempra (SRE) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

Sempra (SRE) is an energy infrastructure company.  The analysis below reveals significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO),  accompanied by mixed signals from recent price action and financial data.  Further investigation is recommended before making investment decisions.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SRE's cumulative return (1.86) is significantly lower than the S&P 500's cumulative return (71.02).  The provided relative divergence (-69.2%) indicates that SRE's performance lags significantly behind the S&P 500, falling at the 19.5th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the index.

The alpha/beta analysis shows mixed results. While CAGR fluctuates,  alpha values are generally low, suggesting that SRE's performance has not consistently exceeded the market. High betas (especially in 2015-2017) indicate high sensitivity to market fluctuations. The exceptionally high alpha of 2.4 in 2023-2025 is an outlier requiring further examination and context.


**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $65.88
* **Previous Close:** $70.73
* **Change:** -$6.86 (a significant daily drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $70.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $76.30

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend. The significant daily drop warrants further investigation into potential market catalysts.


**3. Market Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.99 (Below 40, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.37 (Positive, but relatively low)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +11.7% (short-term upward trend, but within a larger downtrend context)
* **Expected Return:** -154.9% (This extremely negative figure requires clarification. It likely represents a potential loss relative to the S&P 500 over the specified timeframe and needs further contextualization within a specific model's assumptions.)

The high market risk indicator, the oversold RSI, and the substantial negative daily price change signal potential volatility.  The extremely low expected return necessitates further review of the underlying methodology and assumptions.
