The price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day averages suggests a recent softening of the downward trend, but the data is still bearish.

This suggests that, based on the provided data, no significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term (2+ years) via a buy-and-hold strategy.
