## Sempra (SRE) Stock Report

This report analyzes Sempra Energy (SRE), a leading energy infrastructure company.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SRE's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO).  While SRE shows a cumulative return of 28.59%, VOO boasts a 82.57% return.  This results in a substantial negative divergence of -54.0%, placing it at the 21.5th percentile of its historical range (-72.1% to 12.1%).

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies year-to-year, Alpha (a measure of outperformance relative to the market) is frequently positive, suggesting periods of outperformance. However, this is inconsistent, and the high Beta (indicating high market sensitivity) explains some of the underperformance compared to the S&P 500, particularly during market downturns.  The substantial negative Alpha in 2023-2025 (-31% CAGR) is alarming.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The stock price is currently at $74.52.  It's trading above its 5-day ($72.34) and 20-day ($69.76) moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it's slightly below its 60-day moving average ($73.73), indicating potential resistance at this level.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 indicates a medium risk level.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 58.88 suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, implying neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.28 indicates positive momentum, supporting the price movement above the short-term moving averages.
* **Relative Divergence:**  A positive change of 0.7 in the 20-day relative divergence suggests short-term upward pressure.
* **Expected Return:** A -80.6% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is extremely negative and needs further investigation. This suggests significant underperformance is anticipated.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and has duplicate entries.  A more complete and accurate dataset is needed for a proper analysis.  However, based on the available (cleaned) data,  EPS and revenue appear volatile.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.01 | 2.57 B$     |
| 2024-08-06 | 1.13 | 2.48 B$     |
| 2024-05-07 | 1.27 | 3.70 B$     |
| 2023-11-03 | 1.14 | 2.89 B$     |


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis. This is a significant limitation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) exhibits a concerning underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While short-term indicators suggest some positive momentum, the long-term outlook appears weak, based on the projected -80.6% underperformance against the S&P 500. The inconsistent earnings data and lack of complete financial information hinder a thorough evaluation. The negative CAGR for 2023-2025 is a major red flag.  Further investigation is necessary to understand the reasons for this underperformance and to assess the validity of the negative long-term expected return.  More comprehensive financial data and a clearer understanding of the market conditions during the periods of high negative alpha are crucial for a more informed investment decision.
