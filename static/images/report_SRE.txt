**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, and the current trend is concerning.  The negative expected return, decreasing ROE, and a recent drop in EPS are all red flags. While analysts maintain a "Buy" rating, the underlying financial data and market performance raise serious questions about the stock's near-term potential. While the MRI and Hybrid signal indicate a "Buy," this is heavily outweighed by other negative signals, and the information presented seems contradictory. The news articles are mixed, offering no clear direction. **Overall, based on this data, investing in Sempra would be a risky proposition.**
