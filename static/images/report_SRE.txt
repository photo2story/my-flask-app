*   **News:** Recent news includes both positive and potentially negative factors.
*   **Earnings/Financials:** Recent earnings show some weakness in EPS. Revenue and profitability have been stable. Equity has been increasing.

Sempra presents a mixed picture. While analyst ratings and recent news offer some optimism, the historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and the concerning "Expected Return" calculation are significant concerns.

The stock appears to be in a short-term pullback within a medium-term uptrend. Further due diligence is warranted.
