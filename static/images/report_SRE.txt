*   **5-day SMA:** 87.9
*   **20-day SMA:** 90.366
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.1982

**Analysis:** SRE's current price is below its 5, 20, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This *could* suggest a short-term downtrend, but it needs to be considered within the broader market context.

*   **Expected Return (%):** -495.4%

**Analysis:**

*   The PPO is negative.
*   The Hybrid Signal is contradicting the Expected Return, indicating a high uncertainty.
*   The negative Expected Return is extremely concerning, implying significant potential losses if held long-term.

## 4. Recent News & Significant Events

*   **Dow transports are stock-market leaders:** This suggests a broader market trend that *could* eventually benefit Sempra, but no direct link.
*   **Sempra's Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum:** This is contradictory to the data presented which suggest a downturn is occurring.
*   **(SRE) Movement Within Algorithmic Entry Frameworks:** This highlights that automated trading systems are active in Sempra's stock, which can contribute to volatility.
*   **UBS Maintains Neutral Rating, Lowers Price Target:** This is a negative signal, as it indicates reduced confidence from a major analyst.
*   **USA Rare Earth Are Tanking Today:** This is unrelated to Sempra.
*   **Sirius Real Estate (LON:SRE) Stock Price Passes Below 200-Day Moving Average:** This is unrelated to Sempra (different ticker, different company).

**Analysis:** The news is mixed, with some articles hinting at potential momentum, but the UBS downgrade and algorithmic trading activity suggest caution. It's important to filter out irrelevant news.

## 4-2. Analyst Opinions

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.82)
*   **Target Price:** Average: $100.13, High: $115.00, Low: $87.00

**Analysis:**  Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating and a target price higher than the current price. However, the recent UBS downgrade (mentioned in the news) contradicts this general consensus, and target prices are just estimations, and should not be taken as face value.

*   **Underperformance:**  SRE has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **High Risk:** The Maximum Drawdown and volatility data show the company has substantial risk.
*   **Recent Weakness:** Recent price action is below key moving averages, and recent earnings were weak.
*   **Conflicting Signals:**  The analyst consensus is "Buy," but recent analyst downgrades and a negative expected return paint a different picture.
*   **Low ROE:** The very low and declining ROE is a major red flag.
*   **Financial Health:** While equity is increasing, profitability metrics are weak.
*   **Mixed News:** News includes both positive and negative sentiment, but the UBS downgrade is notable.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the data provided, **a cautious or even bearish stance on Sempra appears warranted.** The company's underperformance, high risk, recent earnings decline, and particularly low ROE are concerning. While analysts have a generally positive outlook, recent downgrades and a negative expected return suggest potential downside risk. Further due diligence, including a deeper dive into Sempra's financials, debt levels, and future projects, is highly recommended before making any investment decisions. It's crucial to understand *why* the ROE is so low and what the company plans to do to improve profitability. The conflicting signals from the hybrid signal and expected return should also be investigated further.
