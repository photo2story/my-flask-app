**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

SRE has shown periods of strong performance but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While the RSI suggests oversold conditions, the negative PPO and recent price action indicate a bearish trend.  The provided expected return is likely inaccurate and requires further investigation.  The financial statements show relatively stable revenue and strong profit margins, but inconsistent earnings and high MDD in past years highlight significant risk.  A thorough investigation into the reasons behind the recent underperformance and inconsistencies in the data provided is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence, including a review of the company's long-term strategy and future growth prospects, is crucial before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The -72% MDD in the 2023-2025 period is a major red flag indicating a high degree of risk.
