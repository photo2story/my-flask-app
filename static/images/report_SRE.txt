| Year       | CAGR    | MDD    | Alpha    | Beta   | Cap(B)  |

| 2018-2020  | -4.0%   | 80.1%  | -28.0%   | 0.2    | 41.6    |
| 2019-2021  | -2.0%   | 80.1%  | -49.0%   | 0.4    | 43.2    |

| 2021-2023  | 22.0%   | 81.1%  | 20.0%    | 0.5    | 48.8    |
| 2022-2024  | 11.0%   | 81.1%  | -10.0%   | 0.6    | 57.2    |
| 2023-2025  | -16.0%  | 74.5%  | -79.0%   | -0.1   | 57.0    |

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows fluctuating performance, with a significant decline in the most recent period (2023-2025).
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown figures are consistently high, indicating substantial volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is largely negative, indicating SRE has underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500, although not explicitly stated in this table), especially in recent periods.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, suggesting SRE is less sensitive to market movements than the S&P 500. A negative beta in the latest period is very unusual.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap (in Billions) has fluctuated but generally increased, suggesting company growth despite performance issues.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** $87.25
*   **Previous Close:** $86.78
*   **Change:** $0.54
*   **5-day SMA:** 87.9
*   **20-day SMA:** 90.366
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.1982

The stock price is currently below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a potential downtrend. The positive change from the previous close indicates a slight recent upward movement, but it's important to consider this within the context of the overall downtrend.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment). This indicates a moderate level of market risk associated with SRE.
*   **RSI:** 24.25. An RSI below 30 is generally considered oversold, suggesting the stock *may* be undervalued and poised for a potential rebound.
*   **PPO:** -0.4783. The Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) is negative, which confirms the downtrend, but its value is relatively small.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (11 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)".  This signal, while stating "Very Safe", seems contradictory given the other indicators. The "MRI: 0.90" presented here seems inconsistent with the MRI reported as 0.7.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 1.9 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase). This indicates a recent, small improvement in relative performance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -495.4%. This is an extremely negative expected return, suggesting significant concerns about SRE's future performance compared to the S&P 500.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed Sentiment:** The news articles present a mixed picture:
    *   Some articles discuss the potential of the transport sector. Since Sempra is a energy infrastructure company, these articles may not be very relevant, unless there is substantial connection.
    *   One article notes "Sempra's (NYSE:SRE) Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum: Does That Call For Deeper Study Of Its Financial Prospects?". This article is cautiously optimistic, suggesting a need for further investigation.
    *   Another reports UBS lowered its price target on Sempra. This is a negative signal.
    *   Another reports about Sirius Real Estate (LON:SRE) Stock Price Passes Below 200-Day Moving Average and that article may not be relevant as it refers to Sirius Real Estate.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** "Buy" (Mean: 1.82) - Analysts generally have a positive outlook on SRE.
*   **Target Price:** Average target price of $100.13 suggests potential upside from the current price of $87.25.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No information is available about recent rating changes.

*   **Volatility:** The stock exhibits high volatility, as indicated by the MDD figures.
*   **Downtrend:** The stock is currently in a downtrend, trading below its major moving averages.
*   **Oversold:** The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, which *could* suggest a potential rebound.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Analyst opinions are generally positive, with a "Buy" consensus and a higher target price. However, UBS recently lowered its price target.
*   **Earnings Concerns:** Recent earnings show a significant drop in EPS, which is a negative signal.
*   **Financial Strengths:** The company maintains high profit margins and growing equity, indicating underlying financial strength.
*   **Extremely Negative Expected Return:** The very large negative expected return indicates significant long-term concerns, possibly outweighing any short-term positive signals.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** The hybrid signal seems contradictory (very safe with a high MRI value), so caution is warranted.
*   **Recent News:** Recent news is mixed with articles discussing the potential of the transport sector, one noting "Sempra's (NYSE:SRE) Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum" and UBS lowered its price target.

**Conclusion:**

Sempra presents a mixed picture. While analysts are generally positive and the company exhibits some financial strengths, there are significant concerns about its underperformance compared to the S&P 500, recent earnings declines, and the very negative long-term expected return. The RSI indicates an oversold condition, which *might* trigger a short-term rebound. It would be wise to conduct further due diligence before making any investment decisions. The contradictory Hybrid Signal should be investigated further.
