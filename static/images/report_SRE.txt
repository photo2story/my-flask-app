*   The data indicates SRE's performance has mirrored the market (Beta of 1.0) throughout the examined periods, with no alpha generation.  CAGR and MDD show no returns or drawdowns, which suggest either no price movement or incomplete data. Market capitalization fluctuates over the years.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** 74.86
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 74.86, 'previousClose': 75.13, 'change': -0.36}
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 75.37
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 74.266
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 72.1286

**Analysis:**

*   The current price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, but above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages.  This suggests a possible short-term downward trend, but an overall upward trend over the past 2-3 months. The small negative change from the previous close does not indicate a significant volatility event.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.0 (Low Risk range is 0.45~0.35)
*   **RSI:** 52.6984

*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

**Analysis:**

*   The RSI of 52.7 suggests a neutral market position, neither overbought nor oversold. A negative PPO suggests a downtrend. An MRI of 0.0 is outside the expected range, indicating that either the MRI is not properly calculated or that current market risk is very low.. The negative change in relative deviation confirms short-term underperformance relative to the benchmark.  The zero expected return suggests no anticipated outperformance of S&P 500 for a long-term investment horizon.
