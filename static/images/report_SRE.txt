**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Sempra (SRE) is an energy company that operates in the U.S. and Mexico.  Over the period analyzed, SRE's cumulative return (81.77%) significantly lagged the S&P 500's cumulative return (125.6%).  The difference is -43.83%, placing it at the 37.92 percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a maximum divergence of 11.69% and a minimum of -77.75%).  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market. The provided CAGR data shows fluctuating performance relative to the S&P 500, with periods of both outperformance and underperformance.  Beta values generally suggest SRE's price movements are less volatile than the overall market (Beta < 1).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $93.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $92.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $87.56
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $84.29

The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the 5-day moving average indicates limited recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (76.1):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (0.66):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (15.68 +):** Shows a recent short-term upward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** This suggests that, based on the provided data, there's no significant expected excess return over the S&P 500 in the long term (2+ years) using a buy-and-hold strategy.  The 0.0% expected return is likely a simplification and needs further context.  The current price ($93.38) being significantly higher than the moving averages, along with the high RSI, suggests that a potential pullback is possible, potentially negating some of the current gains and affecting the long-term return calculation.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows some variability.  While some quarters show high EPS and Revenue, others show lower figures.  To effectively analyze this, we need the actual expected EPS and revenue figures to compare to the reported numbers.  A comparison between actuals and expectations would highlight whether the company is meeting or exceeding expectations.  Without this, it's impossible to draw solid conclusions about the company's performance.  Further analysis is needed to assess revenue growth and profitability trends.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue remains relatively stable, however, the profit margin fluctuates. A slight downward trend in the profit margin is observable from 2024 Q1 to 2024 Q3.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is consistently growing but ROE remains relatively low and shows no clear trend. This requires further context and comparison to industry benchmarks.


**7. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent News (Missing):**  The provided data lacks information on recent news, earnings announcements, and analyst opinions. This information is crucial for a comprehensive analysis.  Accessing recent news from sources like Shacknews and FINBOLD would provide critical context for evaluating the stock's current market outlook and recent performance.  We need information on analyst ratings and price targets to gain a more complete picture.


**8. Overall Analysis Summary:**

SRE's performance has lagged the S&P 500.  While recent price action suggests a short-term uptrend, technical indicators suggest the stock is overbought, indicating a possible correction.  The financial data shows some variability in profitability, requiring further investigation to understand long-term trends.  The lack of recent news and analyst sentiment prevents a complete evaluation.  Crucially, the absence of expected EPS and revenue figures for the most recent quarter prevents a thorough assessment of the company's performance against its own expectations.

Independent research and consultation with a financial advisor are recommended before making any investment decisions.  Additional data, particularly recent news and analyst reports, are needed for a more complete and accurate assessment of SRE's prospects.
