**Analysis:**
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is frequently negative, especially in the latest period, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark. This means Sempra has not been generating excess returns compared to what would be expected based on its beta.
*   **Beta:** The Beta values are generally below 1, indicating that Sempra has been less volatile than the market (S&P 500).
*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) fluctuates significantly, with both positive and negative periods, reflecting inconsistent growth.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values are relatively high in some periods (e.g., 43.5%), indicating significant potential losses from peak to trough.
*   **Cap:** Market capitalization has increased significantly, suggesting overall growth in the company's valuation despite volatility.

*   **20-day SMA:** 88.57
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.02

**Analysis:**

The stock price has recently declined. The current price (87.54) is below the 5-day (88.92) and 20-day (88.57) Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The 60-day SMA (91.02) is above the current price, reinforcing the downward trend.  The negative change in the last market data confirms this recent downward pressure.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 54.62 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.26 (Slightly Bullish)

*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 3.8 (+) (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -354.2%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, indicating moderate risk.
*   The RSI of 54.62 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   The PPO is slightly positive, which could suggest a mildly bullish trend.
*   The recent divergence change suggests a short-term upward movement, although this seems contradicted by other data.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Sempra (SRE) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and recent data points to several potential concerns.  The company faces a potential $471 million after-tax earnings impact from a regulatory decision. Recent EPS and ROE have declined, and recent analyst target is only a bit over the current price with neutral consensus. This comes with decreased revenue and potentially decreased profit margin. Overall, Sempra has potential market risk involved in the decision with high fluctuation. While the MRI is moderate and the stock is considered a defensive play, the extremely negative projected return warrants caution.
