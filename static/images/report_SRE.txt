**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

Sempra (SRE) is an American energy company focused on the energy infrastructure industry.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), SRE significantly underperformed over the analyzed period, lagging by 69.16%.

* **Previous Close:** $70.73
* **Change:** -$6.86 (a significant drop)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $70.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $76.30

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.  The significant one-day drop of $6.86 warrants further investigation into potential news or market events that may have triggered this decline.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.99 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.37 (Positive, suggesting a potential bullish momentum but weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +11.7% (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -154.9% (This extremely negative figure suggests a very pessimistic outlook for future returns relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon (2+ years).  This needs careful scrutiny as it's an unusually large negative value.)

The combination of high market risk, a relatively low RSI, and a large negative expected return paints a cautious picture.  The recent price drop of $6.86 significantly contributes to this negative outlook, suggesting a potential need for caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) exhibits significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a considerable negative return difference.  While some technical indicators hint at potential short-term upward movement, the overall picture is cautious due to high market risk, recent price decline, and a very negative long-term expected return.  Earnings data shows some volatility, and further investigation into the reasons behind the fluctuations is necessary.  The extremely negative projected CAGR for 2023-2025 requires a thorough review of the underlying assumptions.  Before considering any investment, a deeper dive into the company's specific circumstances, including any recent news impacting its stock price, is strongly recommended. The data provided contains inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings) and unusually extreme values (expected return), warranting careful validation and further investigation before drawing definite conclusions.
