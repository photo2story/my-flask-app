### 7. Overall Summary and Recommendation

**Summary:**

Sempra (SRE) is currently underperforming the broader market, as indicated by its negative spread compared to the S&P 500 and poor recent alpha values. While analyst consensus is generally positive, the recent insider selling, declining ROE, and negative long-term expected return are concerning.

**Recommendation:**

**Neutral to Slightly Bearish.** The high analyst consensus and low MRI warrant a cautious approach. However, the underperformance against the S&P 500 and the negative expected return suggest investors should be wary of long-term investment. It is highly suggested that you do further due diligence on the stock before purchasing it.
