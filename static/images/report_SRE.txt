### 2. Recent Stock Price Movement

*   **Current Price:** 92.29
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 91.81, Previous Close: 92.06, Change: -0.27
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 91.95
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 90.71
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 84.95

The price is slightly below the previous close and the 5-day moving average, but above the 20 and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term consolidation after a recent upward trend.

### 3. Technical Indicators and Outlook

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 60.94 (approaching overbought territory)
*   **PPO:** -0.23

*   **Expected Return:** -211.4% (Significant underperformance relative to S&P 500 over a 2+ year investment horizon)

The MRI suggests that, based on the model, SRE is considered a relatively safe investment currently. The RSI indicates increasing buying pressure, while the negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average. The negative Expected Return is a significant red flag, suggesting the model predicts substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500. The 'change' of -0.27 is not very high, so its impact is not big.
