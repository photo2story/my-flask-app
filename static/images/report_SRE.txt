**Note:** The fact that the last market price ($93.11) is only slightly higher than the closing price does not indicate any significant price jump or plunge.

The most recent quarter (2024-11-06) shows a slight decrease in EPS and revenue compared to the previous quarter (2024-08-06), but needs further analysis to fully interpret.  Missing is the comparison to analyst expectations to gauge whether the results beat or missed forecasts. More data points are needed to establish clear trends.

**8. Overall Summary:**

Technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term correction given its overbought RSI.  Financial data reveal volatility but generally positive profit margins and moderate ROE.  However, significant inconsistencies in CAGR, MDD, and Alpha values raise concerns. Deeper analysis using more data and incorporating market sentiment from recent news and analyst opinions is essential before making an investment decision. The 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500, also raises a red flag and demands further analysis.
