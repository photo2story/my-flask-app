**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) has shown periods of strong performance but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) recently. While the company boasts high profit margins and a growing equity base, inconsistent earnings, recent underperformance compared to the market, and a negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns.  The overbought RSI suggests potential for a price correction.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and clarification of the duplicate earnings data are necessary before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The high Beta suggests significant market risk.  The negative long-term expected return strongly suggests considering alternative investments with a higher expected return relative to the market.
