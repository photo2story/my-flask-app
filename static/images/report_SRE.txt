The high Beta suggests significant market sensitivity.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $88.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $87.12

* **PPO (-0.32):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (-1.5):** Shows a recent downward trend in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-76.9%):**  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is highly concerning and needs further investigation to understand the basis of this calculation.  The provided data does not support such a dramatically negative expectation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals mixed results:

* **EPS:**  Fluctuates between $1.01 and $1.27, showing no clear upward or downward trend.  There appears to be a duplication of data for 2024-11-06.
* **Revenue:**  Revenue also fluctuates significantly ($2.48B to $3.70B), demonstrating inconsistent performance without a clear trend.  The duplicated entry for 2024-11-06 further hinders analysis.  Without knowing the expectations, it's impossible to definitively label any beat or miss.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue shows some quarterly fluctuation but generally remains within a relatively narrow range.
* **Profit Margin:**  Profit margins are generally strong (40-46%), though there is some quarter-to-quarter variation.
* **Equity:**  Steady increase in equity over the period.
* **ROE:**  ROE is relatively stable, around 2.5%, indicating consistent profitability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **No recent earnings news (within the last 2 days) is provided.**
* **Market Outlook and analyst opinions are missing.**  This critical information is needed for a comprehensive analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra Energy (SRE) exhibits mixed signals. While possessing generally strong financials (profit margins, equity growth), its recent price performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition, but bearish momentum is also present. Inconsistent earnings data prevents a clear conclusion on the company's growth trajectory.  The extremely negative projected long-term return requires further clarification and justification as it is not supported by the provided data. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions significantly limits the scope of this analysis.  More data, including details on market expectations for earnings, is crucial for a more accurate assessment.

**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the incomplete data and conflicting signals, a definitive buy or sell recommendation is not possible at this time.  Further investigation is needed into the extremely negative long-term expected return calculation, recent market sentiment, and analyst opinions to provide a complete picture of SRE's investment potential.  Close monitoring of the stock price and future earnings reports is recommended.
