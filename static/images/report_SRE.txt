**7. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) shows mixed signals. While its fundamentals (revenue, profit margins) appear relatively strong, its performance significantly lags the S&P 500.  The high beta indicates substantial market sensitivity. The low alpha, coupled with a very negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500, raises serious concerns.  The oversold RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook appears uncertain.  Further investigation is required into the reason for the dramatically negative expected return, and clarification of the duplicate earnings data is necessary before forming a definitive conclusion.  The current price is below its moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  Before investing, a thorough due diligence is necessary to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and the extremely negative long-term return projection.
