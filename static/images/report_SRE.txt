* **5-Day Moving Average:** $83.59

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (27.67):**  Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.

* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-17.0):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (-166.9%):** This extremely negative figure suggests a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is projected over the long term (2+ years).  This drastic prediction warrants further investigation into the underlying assumptions.

**7.  Overall Summary:**

Sempra (SRE) presents a mixed picture. While it boasts high profit margins and consistent revenue, its significant underperformance against the S&P 500, declining EPS, and a projected extremely negative long-term return (which requires further scrutiny) raise serious concerns.  The current oversold conditions (RSI) might suggest a potential bounce, but the negative momentum (PPO) and downward price trend indicate a bearish outlook.  Investors should carefully consider the significant risks before investing, especially given the highly negative long-term return prediction.  Further investigation into the causes of the underperformance and the assumptions behind the projected return is crucial before making any investment decision.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry) also require clarification.
