## Sempra (SRE) Stock Report

This report analyzes Sempra Energy (SRE), a leading North American energy infrastructure company.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SRE's cumulative return (58.92%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 120.25%. The current relative divergence is -61.3%, indicating that SRE's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500, relative to its historical range of performance (-72.7% to 14.2%).


The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows mixed results. While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies significantly year over year, ranging from a low of -7% to a high of 46%, the Alpha (outperformance relative to the market) consistently remains positive, ranging from 0 to 0.8.  The Beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, is consistently high (above 27), indicating that SRE is significantly more volatile than the overall market.  This high beta explains some of the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 in some periods.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) also shows periods of substantial losses, highlighting the risk associated with this investment.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $83.43
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $82.40
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $82.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $86.69

The price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.48 (from $82.21) may signal a temporary reversal, but further observation is needed.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 54.43 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.28 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -161.2%  This extremely negative expected return warrants significant caution.  It is crucial to investigate the basis for this prediction.

The recent price change reflects a modest positive move. The negative expected return is a significant concern and requires further investigation into the methodology used to arrive at this figure.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and Revenue.  Note the duplicate entry for 2024-11-06.  This needs clarification.  A downward trend in EPS is noticeable in the last two reported quarters. Revenue also shows inconsistency, requiring deeper analysis to understand the underlying factors.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.01 | $2.57 B       |
| 2024-08-06 | 1.13 | $2.48 B       |
| 2024-05-07 | 1.27 | $3.70 B       |
| 2023-11-03 | 1.14 | $2.89 B       |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.14 | $2.89 B       |


**5) Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability show some volatility, but generally maintain a high profit margin (above 40%). Equity has been steadily increasing, while ROE (Return on Equity) shows a slight downward trend.  Further analysis is needed to interpret these trends in context with the industry and macroeconomic conditions.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $2.78B | 44.49% |
| 2024-06-30 | $3.01B | 44.20% |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.64B | 46.04% |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.49B | 40.79% |
| 2023-09-30 | $3.33B | 40.34% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE  |
|---------|-----------|------|
| 2024-09-30 | $29.72B  | 2.18% |
| 2024-06-30 | $29.50B  | 2.46% |
| 2024-03-31 | $29.16B  | 2.79% |
| 2023-12-31 | $28.70B  | 2.61% |
| 2023-09-30 | $28.26B  | 2.59% |



**6) Overall Analysis:**

SRE has shown considerable volatility and underperformance relative to the S&P 500. While the Alpha suggests potential for outperformance, the high Beta indicates substantial risk.  The negative long-term expected return is a major red flag and needs further scrutiny.  Recent earnings data shows inconsistencies requiring more in-depth analysis.  The financial information shows stable profitability but inconsistent revenue and a slightly declining ROE.  Overall, a more comprehensive analysis, including industry benchmarks and macroeconomic factors, is necessary to make an informed investment decision.  The highly negative projected return should be investigated thoroughly before considering any investment.
