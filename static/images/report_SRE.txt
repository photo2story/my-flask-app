* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.32
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $86.51

* **RSI (29.77):** Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.84):** Shows a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** A positive 0.5 suggests a recent short-term upward trend.  However, given the overall context of the moving averages, this should be interpreted cautiously.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided data indicates a 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).

The price of $89.16 doesn't trigger any specific alerts regarding rapid price changes.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent market outlook is provided. Analyst opinions and performance highlights are missing from the input data.  To provide a thorough analysis, this information is crucial.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) shows some positive financial indicators, particularly strong profit margins and increasing equity. However, the stock's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, although the recent short-term price movement shows some minor upwards pressure. Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, presenting potential opportunity, but bearish momentum remains. The lack of news and detailed earnings analysis, however, limits a conclusive overall assessment.  The provided expected return of 0% relative to the S&P 500 suggests that, based on currently available models,  long-term outperformance is unlikely, although it does not predict the absolute price movements.  Further investigation, including analysis of the full earnings reports, analyst reports, and market outlook, is necessary before forming a firm investment opinion.
