**7. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, despite strong revenue and profit margins.  The negative expected return is a major concern and needs further clarification.  The inconsistent earnings data prevents a thorough assessment of earnings trends.  While the company demonstrates healthy financial fundamentals, its relative underperformance in the market is a significant issue.  More in-depth analysis is needed to understand the reasons for this underperformance and the basis for the extremely negative expected return projection. The technical indicators suggest a possible oversold condition, but not a strong buy signal.  Further investigation into the -220.9% expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.
