**Analysis:**

*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** Confirms the short-term underperformance trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally negative expected return is a *major* red flag. This suggests that, based on the data and model used to generate this number, SRE is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term. This is a strong warning signal.
