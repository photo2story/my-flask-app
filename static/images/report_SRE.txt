**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current closing price is $76.94.  The stock is trading below its 5-day ($81.45), 20-day ($85.90), and 60-day ($87.57) moving averages, indicating a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (20.57):**  Suggests the stock is in oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity. However, this should be considered in conjunction with other indicators.
* **PPO (-1.19):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength Change (-19.1%):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-267.9%):** This extremely negative figure suggests a significant underperformance expectation compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This is likely an error or requires further clarification on the calculation methodology.  The current price of $76.94 does not appear to indicate a recent sharp price movement (sudden surge or plunge).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-11-06.  Further analysis requires clarification on the duplicated data point.  A consistent downward trend in EPS isn't readily apparent.

**7.  Summary:**

Sempra Energy (SRE) exhibits strong financial fundamentals with consistent high profit margins and growing equity. However, its stock price performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500,  with a negative alpha and high maximum drawdowns in certain periods.  Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, but bearish momentum is present. The extremely negative expected return needs further investigation.  A thorough evaluation requires clarifying the duplicated earnings data and the methodology behind the extremely negative expected return calculation.  Considering the considerable risk and underperformance relative to the market, investment decisions should carefully weigh the company's solid financials against its past performance and current market position.
