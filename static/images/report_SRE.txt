2025-12-23 - Analysis Report
Here's a comprehensive analysis of Sempra (SRE), incorporating the data provided:

**Company Overview:**

Sempra is an energy infrastructure company that develops and delivers energy to a large North American customer base.

**1) Return Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **Return Comparison:** Sempra's cumulative return (13.13%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500 (100.88%) over the observed period. The divergence is substantial at -87.75, with a relative divergence of 4.4, placing it near the bottom of its historical divergence range.
*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**
    *   **CAGR:** Varies significantly, from -16% to 35%, suggesting inconsistent growth patterns.
    *   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdowns (70.6% - 81.1%) indicate significant volatility and risk.
    *   **Alpha:** Predominantly negative alpha, indicating underperformance relative to its expected return based on its beta.  Positive alpha in 2017-2019 and 2021-2023.
    *   **Beta:** Generally low (around 0.1-0.6), suggesting SRE is less volatile than the overall market. In 2023-2025 period, Beta is -0.1.
    *   **Cap:** Market capitalization ranged from $35.4B to $58.0B during the time frame.

**Analysis of Alpha/Beta:** The negative alpha, particularly in recent years (2023-2025), is concerning. Despite lower beta, suggesting lower market-correlated risk, SRE is not generating returns commensurate with that risk profile. The large MDDs highlight downside risk.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** $86.94
*   **Last Market Data:** $88.09 (previous close of $86.94, change of $1.32) indicates a recent positive movement in the stock price.
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day SMA: $87.49
    *   20-day SMA: $90.16
    *   60-day SMA: $91.19

**Analysis of Stock Price:** The stock price is trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day simple moving averages. The recent uptick indicated by Last Market Data is a positive sign, but the overall trend based on the SMAs still suggests a potential downtrend.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment).
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 17.8 (Oversold).
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.45.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (11 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90).
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -0.7 (Short-term decline).
*   **Expected Return:** -787%.

**Analysis of Technical Indicators:** The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, which *could* signal a potential buying opportunity, but needs to be evaluated in conjunction with other factors. The negative PPO reinforces the downward momentum. The Hybrid Signal suggests a strong buy recommendation. The large negative expected return is highly concerning.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed Headlines:** The news headlines present a mixed picture.
    *   Some articles discuss earning potential from Sempra stock.
    *   Others focus on institutional ownership increases.
    *   Some focus on revisiting valuation after CPUC rulings.
    *   Others highlight a "neutral" recommendation from UBS.
*   **Impact:** The CPUC ruling is significant as it affects the profitability of utilities.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** A "Buy" rating (Mean = 1.82) from 15 analysts.
*   **Target Price:** Average target price of $100.07, suggesting upside potential from the current price.
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No information provided.

**Analysis of Analyst Opinions:** The "Buy" consensus and target price suggest analysts generally view the stock favorably, *but* these opinions might not fully reflect the recent poor performance and negative indicators.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Underperformance:** Sempra has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Volatility:** High MDDs suggest considerable downside risk.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators are mixed. While the RSI suggests it is oversold, the moving averages suggest downward momentum, and the negative expected return is extremely concerning. The Hybrid Signal is positive.
*   **Earnings & Financials:** Recent earnings are lower. ROE is declining.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** While analysts have a buy rating, this may not reflect the recent negative financial indicators, decline in the stock price, and future business environment.
*   **CPUC Ruling:** Regulatory changes, like the CPUC ruling, can have a major impact on utilities, introducing uncertainty.
*   **Overall:** Based on this data, Sempra appears to be a risky investment at this time. The strong "buy" recommendation requires more scrutiny. The extremely negative expected return raises serious concerns. The positive analyst sentiment is not substantiated by the recent financials.
