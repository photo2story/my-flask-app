**6) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $3.15B    | 42.94%        |
| 2025-06-30   | $3.00B    | 46.73%        |
| 2025-03-31   | $3.80B    | 47.21%        |
| 2024-12-31   | $3.76B    | 49.23%        |
| 2024-09-30   | $2.78B    | 44.49%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE     |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| 2025-09-30   | $31.17B   | 0.30%   |
| 2025-06-30   | $31.72B   | 1.49%   |
| 2025-03-31   | $31.66B   | 2.90%   |
| 2024-12-31   | $31.24B   | 2.16%   |
| 2024-09-30   | $29.72B   | 2.18%   |

**Analysis:** Revenue has been relatively stable with a slight decline in the most recent quarter. Profit margins are healthy but have also shown a recent decrease.  Equity is steadily growing.  However, the Return on Equity (ROE) is low, particularly in the latest quarter, indicating that the company is not generating significant profits from its equity.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Sempra has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, evidenced by a large negative divergence and negative Alpha values. While analysts have a positive outlook with a "Buy" consensus and target price above the current market price, recent earnings have been weak, and ROE is low. The MRI indicates favorable investment conditions, and the hybrid signal recommends buying, potentially indicating undervaluation. However, the news is mixed, and the expected return is 0%. Technical indicators suggest a short-term upward trend but a longer-term downward trend. Overall, Sempra presents a mixed investment picture with both potential opportunities and significant risks. The very low expected return and high MDD values during the provided periods is concerning. Investors should carefully weigh these factors before making a decision.
