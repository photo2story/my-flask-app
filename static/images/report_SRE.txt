While periods of positive alpha (outperformance) exist (e.g., 2017-2019), these are counterbalanced by periods of substantial negative alpha (underperformance), such as 2023-2025.

Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and the accuracy of the projected return.  A thorough review of the company's fundamentals, industry trends, and competitive landscape is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated entry in the earnings data needs clarification.  The extreme negative expected return requires re-evaluation.
