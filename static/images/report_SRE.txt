This report analyzes Sempra Energy (SRE), a leading North American energy infrastructure company.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

SRE's cumulative return is 66.85%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's 117.56% cumulative return.  The difference is -50.7%, placing it at the 25.2nd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -72.6% and a maximum of 14.3%).  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows a consistently low alpha (around 0.1) indicating that SRE's returns haven't significantly outperformed the market, even considering its beta (which fluctuates between 27 and 56, implying varying levels of market sensitivity).  The maximum drawdown (MDD) varies considerably across periods, highlighting periods of significant risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $87.04

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $86.36
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $89.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $86.97

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages but below the 20-day moving average, suggesting some short-term weakness but potential for recovery.  The Last Market Price ($87.96) shows a slight upward movement from the closing price.  It is not a significant jump to warrant labeling it as a "sharp rebound."

* **PPO (-0.62):** Negative value points to bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+1.4):** Indicates a recent short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.0%. This suggests that, based on the provided data, there is no expectation of outperformance against the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment.  This should be interpreted cautiously as it relies solely on the limited data provided and doesn't incorporate broader market forecasts or future company performance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Shows some fluctuation but generally remains relatively stable around $2.5-3.7B, with a notable peak in May 2024.  There is no clear upward trend.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

SRE's performance has lagged the S&P 500 considerably. While recent price action suggests some potential for recovery (oversold RSI), the bearish PPO and inconsistent earnings data raise concerns. The lack of clear revenue growth and fluctuating EPS need further investigation.
