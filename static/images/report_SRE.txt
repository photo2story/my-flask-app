**7.  Overall Summary:**

Sempra (SRE) shows mixed signals. While the company boasts strong financials (high profit margins, increasing equity) and recent positive price momentum, its significant underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term and a projected negative return compared to the market raise serious concerns. The short-term bullish signals should be considered in light of this longer-term underperformance.  Further investigation into the reasons for the consistent underperformance relative to the market is crucial before making any investment decisions. The provided data should be verified for accuracy, and additional analysis (including comparison to industry peers and future earnings forecasts) is needed for a more comprehensive evaluation.  The -91.9% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over two years is a significant negative indicator.
