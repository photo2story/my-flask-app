## Sempra (SRE) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Sempra Energy (SRE), a leading North American energy infrastructure company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Sempra's cumulative return (62.74%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (118.37%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -55.6%, placing it in the 19.7th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -72.7% and a maximum of 14.2%). This indicates that Sempra's underperformance is notable, but not entirely unprecedented within its historical context.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $85.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $81.33
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $84.75
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $87.40

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a possible downward pressure in the medium term.  The recent price increase of $1.42 (from $83.99) reflects a short-term positive movement.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (44.23):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutrality.
* **PPO (-0.0473):** A negative value suggests bearish momentum, but the magnitude is relatively small.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (+7.2):** Shows a short-term upward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (-95.5%):**  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a significant concern.  It suggests the model anticipates significant underperformance compared to the market benchmark.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicate entries.  A consistent and accurate dataset is needed for a proper analysis of earnings trends.  However, a preliminary look suggests some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  Further investigation is required.

**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals a generally stable, yet slightly declining, profit margin.  Revenue fluctuates but remains high overall.  ROE is relatively low and consistent, but does not showcase robust growth.  A more detailed analysis, including trends and comparisons to industry benchmarks, would be beneficial.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $2.78B | 44.49%       |

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra's performance relative to the S&P 500 is significantly weak, as indicated by a large negative cumulative return difference. While short-term indicators suggest some positive momentum, the long-term outlook is considerably pessimistic according to the provided expected return. The inconsistent earnings data prevents a comprehensive assessment of the company's profitability trends.  The financial statements show generally stable profitability, but ROE is relatively low.  Further investigation is needed to understand the drivers of underperformance relative to the market and to ascertain the accuracy and consistency of the data provided. The significantly negative expected return needs further justification and clarification regarding the model used.


**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the incomplete and inconsistent data, a definitive conclusion about Sempra's investment prospects is difficult to reach.  More complete and accurate data, along with a deeper analysis of the company's fundamentals and competitive landscape, is needed before making any investment decisions.  The -95.5% projected long-term return compared to the S&P 500 is a major red flag requiring further investigation into the underlying assumptions.
