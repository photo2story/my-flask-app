*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 63.75
*   **PPO:** -0.0627
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (23 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Dividend_0.65 Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)

*   **Expected Return:** -294.1% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI of 63.75 is approaching overbought territory but not yet at the extreme.  The negative PPO indicates that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, signaling potential weakness. The hybrid signal is recommending a full cash investment, and also Dividend and Monthly Investment strategies. The recent increase in relative spread is a positive sign, showing some short-term improvement against the S&P 500.
