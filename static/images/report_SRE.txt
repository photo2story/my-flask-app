## Sempra Energy (SRE) Stock Review

This report analyzes Sempra Energy (SRE), a leading North American energy infrastructure company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Sempra's cumulative return (83.52%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's cumulative return (128.86%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -45.3%, placing it at the 36.3rd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (relative to a minimum difference of -77.8% and a maximum of 11.7%).  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistently positive alpha (ranging from 1.2 to 1.5), suggesting that Sempra has outperformed the market in terms of risk-adjusted returns. However, this alpha is not reflected in the cumulative return when compared to the S&P 500. The beta, consistently above 1, indicates higher volatility than the market. Market conditions (e.g., sector performance) might explain the discrepancy between alpha and overall cumulative returns.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $94.26

* **Relative Strength (20-day change +15.9%):**  Shows a recent strengthening of the stock's relative performance.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** This indicates no expected excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), based on provided data. This needs further analysis and is likely an overly simplistic assessment. The lack of an explicit time horizon or consideration of risk make this number unreliable. The market outlook and other relevant factors are not included.

Without further context or expectations, it is impossible to assess whether these results represent beats or misses.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of market outlook and analyst sentiment is impossible.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra Energy (SRE) shows mixed signals. While it exhibits positive alpha indicating outperformance on a risk-adjusted basis, its cumulative returns significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The recent price movement suggests a short-term uptrend, but RSI is approaching overbought territory. Earnings show volatility without clear trends.  Financial information suggests a generally healthy financial position. However, the lack of recent news, analyst opinions, and a more detailed outlook on expected returns severely limits the scope of a comprehensive analysis.  More data, especially future earnings reports and information about market expectations, are needed for a more robust conclusion. The provided expected return of 0.0% should be treated with caution due to the lack of context.
