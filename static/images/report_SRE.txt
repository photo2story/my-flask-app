Sempra Energy (SRE) has shown a cumulative return of 81.6%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which achieved a 129.57% return over the same period.  The difference is -48.0%, placing it at the 33.3rd percentile of its historical range of divergence from the S&P 500 (-77.8% to 11.7%).

**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistently positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) across the analyzed periods, ranging from 1.2 to 1.5.  However, the high beta (33.9 - 48.0) indicates significant sensitivity to market fluctuations. While the company has outperformed the market historically based on alpha, the high beta suggests that during market downturns, SRE will likely experience larger losses than the overall market.  Market capitalization has also steadily increased.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $89.82
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $85.35
