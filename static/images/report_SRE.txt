## Sempra (SRE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Sempra (SRE) shows a cumulative return of 59.13%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 121.09%.  The difference is -62.0%, placing it at the 12.3rd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum divergence of -72.7% and a maximum of 14.2%).  Sempra is a US-based energy company that provides electric and natural gas services.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows a consistently low alpha (around 0.1), indicating that SRE's returns have largely tracked the market (Beta ~27-46).  While CAGR fluctuates from year to year, it's generally lower than the S&P 500's implied returns during those periods.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) values in some periods highlight significant risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $83.29
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $82.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $83.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $87.26

The price is slightly above its 20-day moving average, suggesting recent bullish momentum. However, it is below its 50-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term bearish trend. The recent price change of $1.60 reflects a positive movement, but the 60-day average significantly above the current price suggests the stock is lagging.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.08 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.20 (Positive, indicating potential bullish momentum)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +3.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -172.2% (This is a significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, likely reflecting the underperformance relative to the market already observed.)

The recent price increase is a positive indicator but needs further assessment in the context of the long-term underperformance implied by the -172.2% expected return. This extreme negative figure requires scrutiny; it's likely an error or misinterpretation in the data provided.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While there are instances of higher EPS ($1.27 in 2024-05-07), more recent quarters have shown lower figures.  There is also inconsistency in the provided data with duplicate entries for 2024-11-06.  Further investigation is needed to verify the accuracy of this data.

**5. Financial Information (Revenue and Profitability):**

Revenue has generally remained relatively stable but higher profit margins were reported in Q1 and Q2 2024.

**Capital and Profitability:**

Equity has steadily increased, while ROE remains relatively low and consistent.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While recent price action shows some short-term positive momentum, the long-term outlook, based on the provided data, appears weak. The company's earnings show some volatility, and its return on equity is moderate.  The dramatically negative expected return needs clarification and investigation.  The analysis is hampered by inconsistencies in the provided earnings data and the extremely negative long-term expected return, suggesting either data errors or an extremely bearish long-term outlook not justified by other data points.  Further investigation is recommended before making any investment decisions.
