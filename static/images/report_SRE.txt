* **Closing Price:** $82.21
* **5-day Moving Average:** $82.00
* **20-day Moving Average:** $82.31
* **60-day Moving Average:** $86.82

The price is slightly below the 5 and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term downward trend. It's significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a more prolonged downtrend.  The recent price increase of $0.23 from the previous close suggests a minor upward correction.

The extremely negative value likely reflects the substantial underperformance compared to the benchmark.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While showing periods of positive alpha and a relatively low beta,  recent performance indicates a concerning trend.  Technical indicators (RSI) suggest oversold conditions, offering a potential entry point for long-term investors. However, the extremely negative expected return, coupled with recent declines in earnings and revenue, warrants caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the -206.6% expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests a potentially risky investment, requiring a thorough due diligence process before consideration.  The provided -206.6% expected return needs significant clarification and further supporting analysis.
