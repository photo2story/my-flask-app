*   **Beta:** Beta is generally low (around 0.0 to 0.6), indicating lower volatility than the S&P 500.  The negative beta for 2023-2025 is unusual and could indicate a period of inverse correlation with the market.

*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 83.538
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 81.0855

**Analysis:**

The stock price closed slightly lower than the previous day. The stock price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend in the short to medium term. The 5-day moving average being above the 20-day and 60-day further supports this trend.

*   **RSI:** 79.84 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.7589

*   **Expected Return (%):** -139.0 (Negative long-term excess return vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

The high RSI indicates the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction. The PPO value is positive, supporting the uptrend. The MRI suggests a favorable market condition for investment. However, the significantly negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting long-term underperformance. The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward momentum.

**Analysis:**

The mixed news presents a conflicting picture. Positive price target adjustments from analysts are encouraging, reflecting optimism about the company's future prospects. However, the insider selling is a negative signal, potentially indicating a lack of confidence in the company's near-term performance. The participation in an energy conference is a neutral event, while the LNG project FID represents a positive catalyst for long-term growth.

The range of target prices indicates varying levels of optimism among analysts.

**7. Overall Assessment:**

Sempra's historical performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  While recent analyst upgrades and project developments provide positive catalysts, several concerning factors warrant caution:

*   **High RSI:** Suggests the stock is overbought and prone to a correction.
*   **Insider Selling:** Raises concerns about management's confidence.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** Indicates potential for long-term underperformance.
*   **Inconsistent Earnings:** Recent earning data is not strong enough.
*   **Recent Change:** The negative changes in price can mean some issues are in place.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the mixed signals, a cautious approach is warranted.  Consider the potential for short-term gains due to positive analyst sentiment and market momentum, but be aware of the high RSI and potential for a correction.  The negative expected return suggests that Sempra may not be a suitable long-term investment at this time, especially compared to the broader market. A more favorable entry point could be sought following a price correction, or after improvements in the company's earnings and long-term outlook.
