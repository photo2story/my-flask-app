*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating significant potential for losses.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is frequently negative, demonstrating underperformance relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500 or similar). The recent significant negative alpha for 2023-2025 is concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low, suggesting Sempra's stock price is less volatile than the market. However, it has been creeping up, indicating it's becoming more correlated with the market. The recent negative Beta should be interpreted with caution (may be a statistical anomaly or indicate inverse correlation).
*   **Cap:** Market capitalization has generally grown.

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 43.70
*   **PPO:** -0.10
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (11 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) Relative Divergence Change:** -3.8 (단기하락 - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -241.1, Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI indicates that, despite some of the other warning signals, it is considered a high investment recommended environment. It should be noted that this is a very broad reading.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 43.7 is approaching oversold territory (typically below 30), but it is not there yet. It suggests the stock *may* be undervalued.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) of -0.10 indicates a minor downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a buy position with 100% of cash allocated, though this conflicts with the high negative Expected Return. This signal should be viewed with skepticism.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent short-term decline relative to the comparison stock.
*   **Expected Return:** The severely negative expected return is a very concerning signal, suggesting significant potential for losses compared to the S&P 500 over a longer timeframe.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Sempra (SRE) presents a mixed picture. While analyst consensus leans towards a "Buy" rating and Goldman Sachs recently upgraded the stock, several warning signs exist. The stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, has a negative expected return, and the recent relative divergence shows a short-term decline. Earnings Per Share and Revenue have been volatile, and Profit Margin and ROE have declined, especially the ROE.

The high MDD values and recent negative alpha indicate potentially higher risk. The high MRI should be considered in the context of broader market conditions and not in isolation.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the comprehensive data, a cautious approach is warranted. While the analyst consensus and Goldman Sachs upgrade offer potential upside, the underperformance, negative expected return, declining profitability, and other concerning indicators suggest this investment carries a higher level of risk. Further due diligence is recommended before making an investment decision.
