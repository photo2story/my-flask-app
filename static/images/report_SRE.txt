**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 31.44 – This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially signaling a buying opportunity, but it's not conclusive on its own.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.22 – A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** -7.0% - This indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -99.3%  This extremely negative figure requires further clarification; it may reflect a longer-term projection or incorporate different risk profiles.  It needs more detailed context.  The current price is not unusually high or indicative of a sudden price drop.

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue:

* **EPS:** Fluctuates between $1.01 and $1.27 over the past four quarters, with no clear trend.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra Energy (SRE) shows mixed signals. While recent financial performance has some weaknesses (fluctuating revenue and EPS, and slightly declining profit margins), the stock is currently trading below its moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.  Technical indicators (RSI and PPO) indicate oversold conditions.  However, a crucial piece of information is missing - the context and methodology behind the -99.3% expected return. The high beta suggests SRE's price movements are strongly influenced by overall market trends, implying that a broader market downturn could negatively impact the stock.  Further research into analyst opinions, specific earning news, and clarification on the expected return calculation is recommended before making any investment decisions.
