**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.86 (slightly below neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.0977 (positive, but close to zero, indicating weak momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.1 (slightly positive, indicating short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -200.4%  This extremely negative expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern and requires further investigation.  The reason for this drastic negative prediction needs clarification, as it is unlikely. This number is likely an error in the provided data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent with duplicate entries for 2024-11-06.  Correcting for this duplication, the trend shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue. While some quarters show strong revenue, EPS shows a decline in the most recent quarter. A more thorough analysis would require a review of the companyâ€™s financial statements for insights into potential drivers of the fluctuation.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.01 | $2.57B      |
| 2024-08-06 | 1.13 | $2.48B      |
| 2024-05-07 | 1.27 | $3.70B      |
| 2023-11-03 | 1.14 | $2.89B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals consistent high profit margins, demonstrating strong profitability. However, Return on Equity (ROE) is relatively low, suggesting the company might not be using its equity as efficiently as possible. Revenue shows some fluctuation but generally remains high.  Further analysis is required to understand the underlying causes of these trends.

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin | Equity     | ROE    |
|------------|------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| 2024-09-30 | $2.78B     | 44.49%        | $29.72B    | 2.18%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $3.01B     | 44.20%        | $29.50B    | 2.46%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.64B     | 46.04%        | $29.16B    | 2.79%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.49B     | 40.79%        | $28.70B    | 2.61%  |
| 2023-09-30 | $3.33B     | 40.34%        | $28.26B    | 2.59%  |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) displays strong profitability but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently.  While technical indicators aren't alarming, the negative long-term expected return (which needs further investigation due to its implausibility) and inconsistent earnings data necessitate a more thorough examination before making any investment decisions.  The relatively low ROE raises concerns about the efficiency of capital utilization.  A deeper dive into the company's financial reports, industry analysis, and future growth prospects is required for a complete assessment.  The reported -200.4% expected return needs to be validated and its source investigated to avoid making incorrect investment assumptions.
