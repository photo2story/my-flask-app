2026-01-01 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown of the SRE (Sempra) data, analyzed and summarized as requested.

**1) Return Rate Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Sempra (SRE) Overview:** Sempra is an energy infrastructure company focused on electricity and natural gas.
*   **Cumulative Return (SRE):** 15.89%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -86.3 (Current), Range: -92.5 (Min) to 13.2 (Max), Relative Divergence: 5.9
*   **Analysis:** Sempra has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. The relative divergence of 5.9 indicates Sempra's underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range compared to VOO, but still a very large gap overall.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2024-2026  | 19.0% | 81.1% | -87.0% | 0.0   | 57.6   |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 19.0% indicates a decent growth rate over the past couple years.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 81.1% shows a significant potential loss from peak to trough. This is very high.
*   **Alpha:** -87.0% indicates significant underperformance compared to the market.
*   **Beta:** 0.0 suggests very low correlation with the overall market, meaning it is not fluctuating with the market and could be very stable.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization):** $57.6 Billion, indicating a large-cap company.
*   **Analysis:** The high MDD and negative Alpha are concerning. The low Beta might appeal to risk-averse investors, but the underperformance is a major drawback.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 89.09
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 88.28, Previous Close: 89.09, Change: -0.91
*   **5-day SMA:** 88.83
*   **20-day SMA:** 88.87
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.18
*   **Analysis:** The stock price is slightly below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages and significantly below its 60-day moving average. This indicates a potential downtrend in the short-term and a larger pullback from the past couple months.. The recent price decrease suggests downward pressure.

**3) Index Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 57.06
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.17
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (24 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-26)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.7 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -582.9%
*   **Analysis:**
    *   The high MRI suggests the model sees this as a good time to invest.
    *   The RSI of 57.06 is in neutral territory, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   The PPO is positive and low, indicating the trend is slightly uptrending.
    *   The hybrid signal is buy and very safe.
    *   Recent relative divergence shows that the price is trending upward.
    *   The extremely negative Expected Return suggests the model anticipates significant losses compared to the S&P 500 if held long-term. This is a HUGE red flag.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

Overall, the data paints a mixed picture of Sempra (SRE). Here's a summary:

*   **Underperformance:** Sempra has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 and shows a large negative alpha, and a low beta.
*   **Financials:** Revenue and profit margins are healthy but show a recent downtrend. ROE has declined significantly. The company is large.
*   **Technical Indicators:**  The MRI suggests a good investment, while the RSI and PPO are neutral/slightly positive. But the EXTREMELY negative Expected Return is a major concern.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts have a "Buy" rating, with target prices above the current price.
*   **News:** Recent news is mixed.
*   **Key Concerns:** The HUGE negative expected return (from the model, not analyst estimates), recent declining revenue, and low ROE are major red flags. The duplicate data entry makes a confident analysis difficult.
*   **Recommendation:** While analysts are positive, the model's negative expected return, recent financial trends, and underperformance suggest caution. Further research is warranted before investing, especially to understand the reason for the model's negative outlook and to account for the duplicate data.
