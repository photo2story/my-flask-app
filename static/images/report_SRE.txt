*   The close and last market price are very similar, reflecting minimal price change

*   **Expected Return (%):** -787.0%

**Analysis of Indicators:**

*   **MRI:** A high MRI suggests that, according to this indicator, the market conditions are generally favorable for investment.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 42.07 is considered neutral, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.
*   **PPO:** The PPO close to 0 suggests relatively low momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests to allocate 100% cash to purchase 24 shares, with a "Very Safe" rating due to the high MRI. This means the algorithm considers it a buying opportunity.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days implies that Sempra's underperformance compared to the S&P 500 has worsened recently.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return of -787.0% is highly concerning and suggests significant potential losses if held long-term. This contradicts the MRI and should be investigated further. This number might be an anomaly or a miscalculation.

While analysts have a positive outlook, the underperformance compared to the S&P 500, volatile earnings, and concerning negative expected return warrant caution.
