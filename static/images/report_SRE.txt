While exhibiting periods of strong growth (e.g., 46% CAGR from 2017-2019), its performance has been inconsistent, resulting in substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) has shown periods of strong growth but also significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While recent earnings show generally healthy profit margins, the inconsistent performance and high maximum drawdowns highlight considerable risk.  Technical indicators present a mixed signal, and the current price is below key moving averages. The -166.3% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term raises serious concerns.  A long-term investment strategy should consider the significant risk involved and the potential for continued underperformance against the broader market.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the inconsistent performance is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The provided data alone is insufficient for a conclusive investment recommendation.
