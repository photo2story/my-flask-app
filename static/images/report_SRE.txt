The Alpha values are mostly negative, indicating underperformance relative to the benchmark (market).  The Beta values are generally low, suggesting relatively low sensitivity to market movements. However, recent years show higher Beta values.  The market cap has generally increased over time.  The significant negative CAGR in 2023-2025 is a major concern.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $68.06
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $66.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.27
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $75.62

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The recent price increase (6.71%) could indicate a short-term bounce, but further observation is needed.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.53 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.48 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.24 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** 0.0 (Neutral short-term)
* **Expected Return:** -215.6% (This extremely negative figure indicates a very pessimistic long-term outlook relative to the S&P 500. This needs further investigation and is likely unreliable).  The large positive price change in *Last-market* could be contributing to this overly negative prediction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While it boasts high profit margins and consistent revenue, its recent price action and negative expected return (which requires further investigation to determine accuracy) paint a bearish picture.  The high market risk indicator adds to the concern.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into the reasons for the significant underperformance relative to the market and a review of the extremely negative projected return, is needed before making any investment decisions. The volatile earnings data requires further investigation to understand underlying trends.  The conflicting signals warrant caution.  A reassessment of the -215.6% expected return is strongly recommended given the positive price change reflected in the *Last-market* data.
