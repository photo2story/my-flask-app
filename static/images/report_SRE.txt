## Sempra (SRE) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Sempra (SRE) is an energy company that operates in the United States and Mexico, primarily focused on natural gas and electricity.  The cumulative return of SRE is 66.85%, significantly lagging the S&P 500's cumulative return of 117.56%. The difference is -50.7%, placing it at the 25.2nd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided min/max range).


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $87.04
* **Last Market Price:** $87.96
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $86.36
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $89.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $86.97

The last market price ($87.96) is slightly above the closing price and 5-day moving average, but below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a recent slight upward trend after a period of consolidation or minor decline. The price is also slightly below its 60-day average.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 31.69 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.62 (Indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.4 (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This implies no significant alpha is expected over the S&P 500 in the long term, based on the provided data)


The last market price of $87.96 doesn't indicate a significant jump (no evidence of a rapid surge or decline) compared to the other data points.  The combination of oversold RSI and negative PPO with slightly positive short-term momentum suggests potential for a near-term recovery, but a long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is suggested.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue:

* **EPS:** Fluctuates between $1.01 and $1.27 over the last four quarters, with no clear upward or downward trend discernible from this limited data.
* **Revenue:** Shows some fluctuation, with the highest revenue in Q2 2024 ($3.70B) and significant drops in subsequent quarters.  There isn't a consistent upward or downward trend apparent.

No specific expectations are available for comparison; therefore, it's impossible to determine whether there have been any beats or misses.  More data is needed for a conclusive trend analysis.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue has fluctuated over the past five quarters, without a clear trend. While there was a significant increase in the second quarter of 2024 ($3.01B), subsequent quarters showed a decline in revenue.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are generally high and consistently above 40% except for the quarter ending December 2023. There's no consistent upward or downward trend evident.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook, analyst opinions, or performance highlights are provided in the input.  This section requires additional information.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While some short-term indicators suggest a possible rebound (oversold RSI, positive 20-day relative divergence change), the long-term outlook against the S&P 500 is negative based on the data provided.  Earnings data shows volatility but no clear trend, and the financial statement information indicates relatively stable but inconsistent performance across various metrics.  More data, specifically regarding recent news, analyst opinions, and a longer time frame for performance analysis, is needed to provide a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment.  The absence of comparative expectations in the earnings data limits the analysis of performance relative to market expectations.
