**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) currently shows signs of underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but the negative PPO and significant price drop below moving averages point to a bearish trend. While the company exhibits strong revenue and profit margins,  the inconsistent earnings, negative alpha in several periods, and the extremely negative projected long-term return (-404.2%) raise significant concerns.  The -404.2% expected return requires validation. Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying reasons for the underperformance and to determine the accuracy of the long-term return projection before making any investment decisions.  Data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings data) also need to be addressed.
