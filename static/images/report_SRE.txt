**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While recent price movements and some technical indicators suggest short-term positive momentum, the long-term outlook, based on the provided -71.8% expected return, is quite negative.  Earnings show volatility, and the financial data presents a mixed picture with stable equity but fluctuating revenue and profit margins. The extremely negative CAGR of -33% in 2023-2025 is a major concern.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and the accuracy of the long-term expected return figure. A thorough due diligence process is required before making any investment decisions.  The large discrepancies in the provided data (e.g., duplicate earnings report entries) necessitate a review of the data source's reliability.
