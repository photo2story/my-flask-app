* **Closing Price:** $70.06
* **Last Market Price:** $70.67 (a $1.34 increase from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $69.95
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $69.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $77.83

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages but significantly below the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent downward trend. The last market price shows a minor uptick.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 56.28 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.73 (Positive momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -0.5 (Short-term weakening)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -202.2% (This extremely negative figure requires further clarification and investigation.  It is unlikely to be accurate.)

The recent price increase of $1.34 might reflect short-term market fluctuations rather than a fundamental change in the company's outlook. The negative long-term expected return needs further investigation; a -202.2% figure is highly unusual and likely erroneous.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | $1.01 | $2.57B        |

| 2024-11-06 | $1.14 | $2.89B        | *(Duplicate entry, needs clarification)*


Earnings show some volatility.  Revenue fluctuates, and EPS is inconsistent.  A duplicate entry needs correction.  Further analysis is needed to assess the long-term earnings trend and sustainability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While financial statements show generally healthy profitability and revenue, the stock's performance lags considerably behind the market.  The inconsistent alpha and beta values across various periods indicate volatility and uncertainty.  The provided -202.2% long-term expected return is highly suspect and requires thorough investigation and validation.  Before considering any investment, further analysis is crucial, including a deeper dive into the -202.2% projected return, correcting the duplicate entry in the earnings data, and investigating the reasons behind the substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  The medium risk MRI warrants caution.
