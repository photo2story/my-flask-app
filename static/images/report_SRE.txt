**5. Financial Information:**

The report states that total revenue and gross profit data are unavailable.  This significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the analyzed period. While some short-term indicators (PPO, relative divergence) suggest bullish momentum, the overall picture is clouded by inconsistent performance (Alpha/Beta), a negative long-term expected return (-166.3%, requires further explanation of calculation), and a lack of crucial financial data (revenue, gross profit).  The volatile earnings further add to the uncertainty.  A thorough review of the -166.3% expected return calculation and obtaining complete financial data are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current data suggests a cautious approach is warranted.
