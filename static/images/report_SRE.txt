## Sempra (SRE) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

Sempra (SRE) is a North American energy infrastructure company.  The company's cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO).  Recent price action shows a slight downward trend, and financial indicators present a mixed picture.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **SRE Cumulative Return:** 30.51%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 87.98%
* **Return Difference:** -57.5%

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different time periods.  While some periods exhibit positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others show negative alpha. Beta values generally hover around 1, indicating sensitivity to market movements.  The significant negative alpha in 2023-2025 suggests a period of substantial underperformance relative to the market. Capitalization (Cap(B)) generally shows an increasing trend.  The high maximum drawdown (MDD) across all periods also raises a concern about risk.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2015-2017  | 13.0% | 68.0% | -20.0% | 0.0 | 27.5 |
| 2016-2018  | 17.0% | 71.0% | -4.0% | 0.4 | 28.7 |
| 2017-2019  | 45.0% | 71.0% | 11.0% | 0.3 | 41.4 |
| 2018-2020  | 12.0% | 71.0% | -18.0% | 1.6 | 36.1 |

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $75.77
* **Last Market Price:** $75.42 (a decrease of -$0.46 or -0.6%)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $75.51
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $72.97
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $72.65

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend.  However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend in the longer term.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 74.19 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a price correction.)
* **PPO:** 0.425 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum.)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return:** -108.7%  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a significant concern.  This suggests that, according to this data, long-term investment may significantly underperform the market.

The price drop of -$0.46 doesn't suggest a significant immediate event impacting price, but it contributes to the overall slightly negative short-term outlook.

**6.  Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) presents a mixed picture. While the company shows relatively stable revenue and profit margins, its performance significantly lags the S&P 500. The extremely negative long-term expected return is a major red flag.  The high maximum drawdown across various periods highlights significant risk. While some periods show positive alpha, the inconsistent performance and the recent negative alpha (along with the negative expected return)  raise serious concerns.  Further investigation into the inconsistent earnings data and a deeper dive into the factors contributing to the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 are crucial before making any investment decisions. The current technical indicators suggest potential for a price correction.  Investors should proceed with caution.
