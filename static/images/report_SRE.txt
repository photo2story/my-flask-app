## Sempra Energy (SRE) Stock Review

This report analyzes Sempra Energy (SRE), a leading North American energy infrastructure company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Sempra's cumulative return is 68.25%, while the S&P 500's is 118.39%.  This represents a difference of -50.1%.  The relative underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is within the historical range of -72.7% to 14.2%, placing it at the 26th percentile of the historical distribution.  This suggests that while SRE has underperformed the S&P 500 recently, this level of underperformance isn't entirely unusual based on its past performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $87.77
* **5-day Moving Average:** $87.44
* **20-day Moving Average:** $88.65
* **60-day Moving Average:** $87.21

The current price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend, although it is above both the 5-day and 60-day moving averages.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 41.97 (Slightly below the 50 threshold, suggesting the stock may be slightly oversold but not in extremely oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.21 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -0.4 (Indicates a recent downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs S&P 500, long-term):** -65.1% (This is a significant negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This should be considered carefully.)

The closing price of $87.77 doesn't indicate any dramatic recent price spikes or drops based on the provided moving averages.  However, the negative expected return is a significant concern.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.

* **EPS:**  Fluctuates between $1.01 and $1.27 over the last four quarters, indicating some inconsistency in profitability. There is an apparent duplication for the 2024-11-06 entry.  This needs clarification.
* **Revenue:** Also shows fluctuations, ranging from $2.48B to $3.70B.  The highest revenue was reported in 2024-05-07.  Again, there is a data duplication that needs to be resolved.
* **Trend:**  There is no clear upward or downward trend in either EPS or revenue based solely on this limited data set.  More historical data would be needed to establish a clear trend.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has been relatively stable around $3B, with some quarterly fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high (40-46%), indicating strong profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has steadily increased, demonstrating growth in shareholder equity. Return on Equity (ROE) remains relatively stable and moderately positive.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or market outlook information was provided, limiting the analysis of recent events and analyst opinions.  The absence of data in this section prevents a comprehensive assessment of the current market sentiment towards SRE.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra Energy (SRE) shows mixed signals.  While it maintains high profit margins and stable revenue, its recent performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a slightly oversold condition but bearish momentum.  The projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  Further investigation is needed to resolve the apparent data duplication in the earnings data and to gain a clearer picture of the market outlook and analyst sentiment.  The lack of recent news and market outlook data significantly limits a complete assessment of the current investment suitability of SRE.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the limited data and the significantly negative projected return compared to the S&P 500,  a thorough review of additional data, including a complete earnings report,  is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Addressing the data discrepancies is essential for accurate analysis.  Consider seeking advice from a financial advisor before making any investment decisions regarding SRE.
