## Sempra Energy (SRE) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Sempra Energy (SRE), a leading North American energy infrastructure company, shows a cumulative return of 70.18% over the analyzed period.  This significantly lags the S&P 500 (VOO) return of 120.73%, resulting in a -50.5% divergence.  The relative divergence of -25.3% indicates SRE's underperformance relative to its historical volatility against the S&P 500.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $90.32
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $91.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $86.09

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The relatively larger gap between the current price and the 20 and 5-day moving averages indicates a more pronounced recent decline.
