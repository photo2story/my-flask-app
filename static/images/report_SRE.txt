Sempra Energy (SRE) shows mixed signals.

The -67.3% expected return needs clarification and may be an outlier.   A more in-depth analysis including a deeper dive into earnings reports, competitor analysis, and macro-economic factors is crucial before making any investment decisions. The conflicting signals suggest further investigation is warranted before drawing strong conclusions about the stock's prospects.
