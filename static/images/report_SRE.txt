**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Sempra (SRE) is a North American energy infrastructure company, primarily focused on natural gas and electricity distribution.  The cumulative return of SRE is 84.47%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 128.31%.  This represents a difference of -43.84%.  The relative divergence (-43.84) places it at the 37.91 percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating underperformance compared to the benchmark index.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided alpha and beta values fluctuate across the analyzed periods.  While showing periods of outperformance (positive alpha), the overall trend suggests that SRE's returns are generally correlated with the broader market (beta consistently above 0.4) but with varying degrees of out- or underperformance.  It is important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $94.77
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $94.05
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $89.34
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $85.16

The stock price is currently trading above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The distance between the closing price and moving averages indicates increasing momentum in the recent period.

**3. Technical Indicators and Relative Divergence:**

* **RSI:** 85.98 – This indicates the stock is currently in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction could be imminent.
* **PPO:** 0.38 –  A positive value suggests bullish momentum, though interpretation requires context within the broader market.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +14.29% – This shows a recent increase in the stock's outperformance against the S&P 500.  The significant positive value combined with the high RSI indicates short-term strength, but also heightened risk of a pullback.

Given the closing price of $94.76 is close to the peak of the recent short-term uptrend, there is a risk of a moderate pullback.  A sharp drop or significant rebound is not immediately indicated, but the overbought RSI signals a cautionary outlook. The expected return of 0.0% for long-term (2+ years) accumulation suggests potential for S&P 500-matching returns, but not significant outperformance given the relative underperformance noted previously.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided financial data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue figures.  While there have been some increases in revenue,  a detailed analysis requiring further information (e.g., YOY growth, industry benchmarks) is needed to determine if the figures represent positive or negative trends.  To assess recent performance fully, comparison to analyst expectations for the most recent quarter's earnings (missing from the data provided) would be crucial.


**6. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows fluctuation but overall maintains high levels. Profit margins show some variability, but generally remain high and stable, demonstrating a solid profit position.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity is growing steadily, and ROE (Return on Equity) is relatively consistent, indicating efficient utilization of capital.  These data points suggest a healthy financial foundation.

**8. Overall Summary:**

SRE has shown periods of both outperformance and underperformance compared to the S&P 500.  Recent price action suggests a short-term uptrend, but technical indicators (high RSI) warn of potential overbought conditions.  The company shows a healthy financial standing with strong revenue and profit margins.  However, a full assessment requires comparison to analyst expectations and news surrounding recent earnings and market outlook.  The expected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is currently considered neutral. Further data and a thorough examination of company-specific factors are needed for a complete investment recommendation.
