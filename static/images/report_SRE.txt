*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  Shows the average yearly growth. It's been quite variable.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):**  The biggest drop from peak to trough. High MDD values suggest high risk.
*   **Alpha:**  How much better or worse the investment performed compared to the market (S&P 500) after accounting for risk (Beta). Negative alpha is bad.
*   **Beta:**  How sensitive the investment is to market movements. Beta around 0 indicates very little correlation with market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap in Billions.

**Analysis:**

*   Sempra's alpha is frequently negative, indicating underperformance relative to the market.
*   Beta values are low, suggesting Sempra's price doesn't move much with the overall market.
*   Maximum Drawdown is very high, indicating significant downside risk over the periods examined.
*   The recent years, especially 2023-2025, show a significant drop in Alpha, coupled with a negative Beta. This suggests Sempra's performance has been particularly poor relative to the market recently and has even moved in the opposite direction.

**7. Overall Analysis & Summary**

Sempra presents a mixed investment picture:

*   **Negative Factors:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative expected return, fluctuating earnings, and relatively low ROE.  High Maximum Drawdown is also concerning.
*   **Positive Factors:**  Recent positive news related to LNG expansion, a "Buy" analyst consensus, and positive short-term price momentum (though potentially overbought).
*   **Key Consideration:** The extremely negative expected return suggests that, despite the short-term positives, the model anticipates significant long-term underperformance compared to the market.

**Recommendation:**  The negative expected return, combined with historical underperformance, makes Sempra a risky investment. While some analysts are positive, the data suggests caution. Further research into the factors driving the negative outlook is warranted.
