## Sempra (SRE) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Sempra Energy (SRE), a leading North American energy infrastructure company.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

SRE's cumulative return of 36.34% significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.17%.  The difference is -79.8%, placing it at the 1.9th percentile of its historical range (max: 14.2%, min: -81.6%).  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results. While CAGR shows periods of strong outperformance (e.g., 2017-2019 with 46% CAGR),  other periods show underperformance, and even negative returns (-7% CAGR from 2020-2022). The beta consistently hovers around 0.7-0.8, indicating a moderate sensitivity to market fluctuations.  However, the high maximum drawdown (MDD) values in certain periods (e.g., -74% in 2023-2025) highlight significant risk.  This risk profile needs further investigation.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

SRE's closing price is $71.57, slightly down from the previous close ($71.57).  The stock is trading below its 5-day ($74.83), 20-day ($81.35), and 60-day ($84.30) moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (30.16):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-1.75):**  Shows a bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-21.5%):**  Confirms a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (-1334.3%):** This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 raises serious concerns and requires further investigation. The methodology for calculating this value needs clarification as this figure is unrealistic for a long-term investment.  A negative value is possible only if a significant decline is anticipated, not in comparison to a positive benchmark return.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Earnings show some volatility. While revenue generally appears strong, EPS shows some fluctuation, with a dip in the most recent quarter.  Further analysis of factors driving revenue and EPS changes is needed.  Note: There is a duplicate entry for 2024-11-06.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.01 | $2.57B      |
| 2024-08-06 | 1.13 | $2.48B      |

| 2024-11-06 | 1.14 | $2.89B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is relatively stable, with profit margins fluctuating between 40% and 49%.  ROE is consistently above 2%, indicating reasonable profitability. However, the recent decline in profit margins and equity requires further investigation.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

SRE has shown periods of strong performance but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years. While some technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce, the overall picture is concerning due to consistent underperformance, high MDD, and a drastically negative expected return (which requires further scrutiny given its implausible value).  A thorough review of the company's strategic direction, competitive landscape, and the methodology used to calculate the extremely negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility and significant risk associated with SRE warrant caution.
