**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Sempra (SRE) has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some periods show positive momentum, other periods (like 2023-2025) showcase substantial losses. The company's financial performance displays some inconsistencies, requiring a more detailed examination of its earnings and financial health.  The -77.1% expected return needs further clarification. Before making any investment decisions, a thorough investigation into the underlying factors driving these results, including a more precise expected return calculation, is necessary.  The high maximum drawdown values suggest the stock can be very volatile.   Consideration should be given to the company's business strategy, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment.
