**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) presents a mixed picture.  While it demonstrates strong profitability margins, its recent performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly.  The volatile alpha and high beta suggest considerable risk. The negative expected return figure requires further investigation and should not be taken as a definitive prediction.   Further analysis into the drivers of revenue and EPS fluctuation, as well as a review of the -228.3% long-term expected return calculation, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Consideration of industry trends and competitive landscape is also vital for a comprehensive assessment.  The current price being below its moving averages and a relatively low RSI point to potential downside, but a further in-depth analysis, including a thorough review of the company's long-term strategy and projections, is recommended.
