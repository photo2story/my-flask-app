* **60-Day Moving Average:** $74.33

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short to medium term.  The recent price increase of $1.04 from the previous close is a positive but needs to be considered in the context of the longer term downward trend.

* **Recent Relative Strength (20-day):** A 10.8% increase signals short-term upward momentum, which is inconsistent with the moving average picture.
* **Expected Return (-77.1%):** This extremely negative expected return, relative to S&P 500 over a long-term period (2+ years), requires further investigation and clarification as to its calculation methodology.  This drastically contrasts with the other provided data.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

Sempra (SRE) presents a mixed picture. While it demonstrates consistent profitability and high profit margins, its underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is significant and concerning.  The short-term technical indicators suggest a weakening trend. The highly negative long-term expected return needs further clarification.  A deeper dive into the company's specific business strategies, competitive landscape, and the reasons for the large discrepancy between its performance and the S&P 500, and the highly negative expected return are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data provided is insufficient for a definitive recommendation.  Additional information regarding the expected return calculation, earnings drivers and future growth prospects is required for a complete analysis.
