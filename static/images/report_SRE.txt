**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.01 | $2.57B        |
| 2024-08-06 | 1.13 | $2.48B        |

| 2024-11-06 | 1.14 | $2.89B        |


There's a noticeable fluctuation in EPS and Revenue, possibly due to seasonality or project-based revenue streams.  A more detailed analysis, including year-over-year comparisons and industry benchmarks, is needed. Note the duplicated entry for 2024-11-06 which needs clarification.

Both revenue and profit margins show some fluctuation. ROE is relatively stable but low.  Further analysis is needed to understand the underlying drivers of these trends.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

SRE's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, although its recent price action shows short-term positive momentum.  The considerable volatility in EPS and revenue, coupled with the low ROE and a highly negative (and unexplained) projected return, raises concerns.  The substantial fluctuations in alpha and beta over different periods highlight the challenges in predicting future performance. Before making any investment decisions, a thorough investigation into the factors driving the recent earnings, the methodology behind the -80.6% expected return, and a comparison to industry peers is essential.  The data provided suggests a need for a more in-depth analysis to properly assess SRE's long-term prospects.
