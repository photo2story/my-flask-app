*   **Earnings and ROE:** The most recent EPS and ROE figures are lower than previous quarters, indicating potential challenges in maintaining profitability.

*   **Expected Return:** Negative Expected Return implies concerns about long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500.

**Conclusion:**

Sempra's current valuation appears to be supported by analyst optimism, but investors should carefully consider the historical underperformance, mixed signals from recent news and financial data, and the potentially negative long-term outlook before making an investment decision. Further research into the reasons behind the recent earnings decline and insider selling is recommended.
