**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate fluctuates, showing periods of growth and decline. Recent periods (2023-2025) show a significant negative CAGR of -16.0%.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility in Sempra's stock.

*   **Beta:** Beta is generally low, indicating that Sempra's price is not very sensitive to the broader market's movements. The negative Beta in 2023-2025 suggests an inverse relationship with the market during that period.

*   **20-day SMA:** 90.16
*   **60-day SMA:** 91.19

**Analysis:**

The closing price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a downward trend. The 5-day SMA is the closest, indicating a potential for a short-term rebound, but the longer-term SMAs suggest continued downward pressure. The positive change from the previous close to the last price could indicate a minor recovery, but the overall trend appears bearish.
