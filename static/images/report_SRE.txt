**0. Key Figures Summary:**

SRE (Sempra) has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly over the analyzed period. While showing some positive recent momentum,  its long-term performance lags behind the market index.  Profitability indicators are strong, but recent earnings show some volatility.  The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 89.44%

The recent price change of $0.28 suggests a small upward movement, not a significant jump.  Given the negative long-term expected return, further investigation into the basis of this prediction is required.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's a duplication of the 2024-11-06 data point.  Further investigation is needed to confirm the accuracy of this data.  Overall, revenue is relatively stable though there is notable fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. EPS shows a similar pattern of some inconsistency.

| 2024-11-06 | 1.01 | $2.57B     |

**5. Financial Information:**

Both revenue and profitability metrics show generally strong and relatively stable performance. Profit margins are consistently above 40%, indicating a healthy business. Return on Equity (ROE) is moderate but relatively consistent, suggesting efficient use of shareholder capital.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) exhibits strong financial fundamentals with consistent revenue and high profit margins.  However, its stock performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 over the long term, leading to a negative long-term expected return (as presented).  Recent price action suggests a possible short-term upward trend, but this is countered by the stock trading below its moving averages.  The provided -120.8% long-term expected return needs further investigation to understand its calculation and assumptions.  Investors should carefully consider the high risk (indicated by significant MDD values in historical data), the inconsistent performance relative to the market, and the volatile earnings before making any investment decisions.  Further due diligence is highly recommended.
