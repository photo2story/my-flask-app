This report analyzes Sempra Energy (SRE), a leading energy infrastructure company, based on provided data.

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) exhibited a cumulative return of 6.36% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) return of 66.27% over the unspecified period. This represents a significant underperformance of -59.9%, placing it at the 15.9th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a historical range of -73.4% to 11.4%).


The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance across different time periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market, Beta >1),  others demonstrate negative alpha, highlighting the volatility and market dependence of SRE's returns.  The high Beta values consistently indicate a significant sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The considerable variation in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) underscores the inconsistent performance of SRE in relation to market conditions.  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values indicate significant potential for losses, particularly in periods like 2019-2021 and 2023-2025.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistency in both EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally stays above $2.5B, there's no clear upward or downward trend visible.  EPS fluctuates, needing further analysis to assess the underlying drivers of this variation.  The repetition of the 2024-11-06 data point requires clarification.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-11-06 | 1.01 | $2.57 B     |
| 2024-08-06 | 1.13 | $2.48 B     |
| 2024-05-07 | 1.27 | $3.70 B     |
| 2023-11-03 | 1.14 | $2.89 B     |
| 2024-11-06 | 1.14 | $2.89 B     |


**5) Financial Information:**

The financial information reveals a relatively stable revenue stream, though with some quarterly fluctuation.  Profit margins are generally high (above 40%), indicating good profitability.  Equity is steadily increasing, reflecting a positive financial position.  Return on Equity (ROE) is relatively low (around 2%), suggesting that the company's profitability relative to its equity is moderate.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $3.76B | 49.23% |
| 2024-09-30 | $2.78B | 44.49% |
| 2024-06-30 | $3.01B | 44.20% |
| 2024-03-31 | $3.64B | 46.04% |
| 2023-12-31 | $3.49B | 40.79% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE |
|---------|----------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $31.24B | 2.16% |
| 2024-09-30 | $29.72B | 2.18% |
| 2024-06-30 | $29.50B | 2.46% |
| 2024-03-31 | $29.16B | 2.79% |
| 2023-12-31 | $28.70B | 2.61% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

Sempra (SRE) shows a mixed picture.  While it boasts strong revenue and profit margins, its performance significantly lags the S&P 500, indicating substantial underperformance. The high Beta suggests considerable market risk. The negative long-term expected return (-142.3%) is a major concern and needs further investigation to verify its reliability.   The inconsistent earnings data and the fluctuating alpha and beta values across different time periods highlight the need for a deeper dive into the company's specific circumstances and future projections before making any investment decisions.  Careful consideration of the high market risk and relatively low ROE is crucial.  The provided -142.3% expected return is incredibly negative and likely erroneous, requiring additional clarification and analysis of the methodology used to derive this figure.
