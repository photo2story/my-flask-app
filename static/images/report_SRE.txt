Investing in Sempra appears risky at this time. The underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the troubling recent declines in profitability metrics (EPS, Profit Margin, ROE), coupled with a significantly negative expected return, raise serious concerns. The positive analyst sentiment and the recommendation from the hybrid signal need to be weighed carefully against these negative factors. The news is not clear enough to consider this a strong buy. Further investigation into the reasons behind the declining financial performance and the discrepancy between the negative expected return and the "Buy" recommendations is essential before making any investment decision.
