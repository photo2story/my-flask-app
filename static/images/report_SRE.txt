The projected high long-term return should be viewed with caution, given inherent market volatility.  Further investigation into the drivers of recent EPS fluctuation and the basis for the high expected return are crucial before making investment decisions.  A thorough sector analysis and comparison to competitors would enhance the robustness of this analysis.
