VRTX has demonstrated significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term.  However, recent performance indicators (RSI, PPO, relative divergence) suggest a short-term bearish trend.

Further investigation into the specific reasons behind the Q2 2024 losses and recent market sentiment is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits the ability to provide a fully informed opinion.
