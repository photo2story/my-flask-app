## Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX), a biotechnology company focused on cystic fibrosis treatments, exhibits strong historical performance significantly outpacing the S&P 500 (VOO).  While recent earnings show some volatility, strong long-term growth potential remains, supported by a relatively high CAGR and positive alpha, although  beta suggests some market sensitivity.  Current valuation metrics need further investigation due to missing revenue data.

* **Closing Price:** $459.0
* **5-day Moving Average:** $459.99
* **20-day Moving Average:** $453.75
* **60-day Moving Average:** $442.95

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting some minor downward pressure, but above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages indicating a relatively positive short- to medium-term trend.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 57.09 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.13 (Slightly negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -5.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 21.2% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected).

The RSI suggests a neutral market sentiment. The negative PPO and downward trend in the relative divergence indicate bearish momentum in the short term. However, the projected long-term return remains strong.



**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue       |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 2024-11-05 | 4.05    | $2.77 B        |
| 2024-08-02 | -13.92  | $2.65 B        |
| 2024-05-07 | 4.26    | $2.69 B        |
| 2023-11-07 | 4.01    | $2.48 B        |
| 2024-11-05 | 4.01    | $2.48 B        | *(Duplicate Entry, likely an error)*


The earnings data shows significant volatility with a large negative EPS in Q2 2024.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reason for this outlier.  Revenue growth appears relatively steady, however, requiring confirmation with complete data.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.


**5) Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a complete financial analysis.  This missing information is a significant limitation.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

VRTX shows a strong historical record of outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with high CAGR and positive alpha. However, recent earnings exhibit volatility, and crucial financial data is missing. The short-term technical indicators suggest some bearish momentum, but the long-term outlook remains positive given the anticipated outperformance and strong historical growth.  Before making any investment decisions, obtaining complete financial statements and investigating the Q2 2024 earnings dip is crucial. The missing financial data is a major concern that needs immediate addressing.
