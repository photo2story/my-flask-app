The substantial positive expected return coupled with high profit margins is encouraging for long-term investors.  However, careful consideration should be given to the significant fluctuations in ROE and the volatility in earnings. Deeper analysis of the drivers behind the earnings volatility and ROE fluctuations is needed to fully assess the risk-reward profile.  Further investigation into specific product performance and pipeline developments is recommended.
