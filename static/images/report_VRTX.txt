## Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX) Stock Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative medicines.

The cumulative return of VRTX is 150.93%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 119.94%.  The difference is 31.0%, placing it at the 60.7th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  This suggests strong outperformance, although the relative percentile should be interpreted cautiously as it only reflects the range of past divergences.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for VRTX, exceeding the market's return indicated by positive alpha values.  The beta, however, is significantly above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market (S&P 500).  Note that the large swings in Alpha and Beta over time suggest this stock is significantly affected by external factors. Note that the large variations in MDD (Maximum Drawdown) suggest periods of significant risk.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $441.52
* **5-day Moving Average:** $441.09
* **20-day Moving Average:** $419.85
* **60-day Moving Average:** $447.57

The price is slightly above its 5-day moving average, suggesting recent strength.  However, it is below both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term downward trend.  The recent price change of $0.19 (0.04%) is minimal and does not suggest any significant short-term price action.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 76.37 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 1.15 – A positive value suggests upward momentum, but it needs to be evaluated in conjunction with other indicators.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +5.9 – Indicates short-term upward momentum, consistent with the positive PPO.

The small price change does not indicate any significant short-term price action (neither a sharp rise nor a sharp decline).

**Expected Return:** The projected 23.2% excess return over the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is significant, but relies heavily on the provided model's accuracy and the assumption of continued outperformance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There are periods of high EPS (Earnings Per Share) and periods of significant losses.  A thorough analysis would require a deeper dive into the underlying causes of this volatility, including specific events impacting the company’s performance.  The repeated entry for 2024-11-05 needs clarification.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX shows strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, supported by high CAGR and positive alpha.  However, significant volatility (high beta and MDD) and inconsistent earnings data necessitate caution.  The currently overbought RSI suggests a potential near-term pullback, while long-term projections remain positive.  A thorough analysis of the causes of earnings volatility and the negative ROE in Q2 2024 is crucial before making any investment decisions. The repeated 2024-11-05 data entry requires clarification and correction.  Further investigation into the financial statements is necessary to provide a more comprehensive assessment.
