* **5-day Moving Average:** $462.49
* **20-day Moving Average:** $476.08
* **60-day Moving Average:** $473.61

The current price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 27.38 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.27 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:**  `nan` (Insufficient data to determine the recent relative divergence, but the price is below the 20-day MA suggesting a short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 78.3% (This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 with long-term, consistent investment.  This is a high number and should be viewed with caution as projections are inherently uncertain).

The current price of $468.13, while below the moving averages, doesn't necessarily indicate a significant drop.  Further analysis is needed to determine if there's been a sharp decline or if this is simply a consolidation period within a broader upward trend.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in EPS.  While there's a recent positive EPS, there were considerable losses in the quarter ending August 2024. Revenue shows a general upward trend, although there's some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation. There is a duplication in the data for November 5th, 2024, potentially indicative of reporting errors.  More detailed context is required for a complete analysis.  This requires clarifying the duplicated data entry.  Without further information (like previous expectations), we canâ€™t definitively identify beats or misses.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Shows relatively stable growth, with some minor fluctuations between quarters.
* **Profit Margin:** Remains consistently high, between 85% and 87%, indicating strong profitability.
* **Equity:** Fluctuates between quarters, however, more information is needed about the causes of the significant drop and subsequent rise.
* **ROE:** Shows significant volatility, with a substantial negative ROE in Q2 2024 (-24.32%). This warrants further investigation.

The financial data indicates overall strong profitability, but the volatility in equity and ROE requires further scrutiny to understand the underlying causes.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) is provided in the prompt.  To provide a complete analysis, up-to-date news concerning earnings releases, market outlook, and analyst opinions should be included.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX has shown significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the longer term. However, the recent price action shows a slight downward trend, indicated by the price being below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages.  Technical indicators point to an oversold condition (RSI), but negative momentum (PPO).  Financial statements show strong profitability margins but inconsistencies in equity and ROE need further analysis.  The provided earnings data indicates volatility, necessitating a deeper dive with more contextual data (e.g., expectations and comparisons to prior periods).  The high projected long-term return requires additional substantiation.  Finally, incorporating current news and analyst opinions is crucial for a complete assessment.  Because of the limited information, it is impossible to provide a complete conclusion on the stock's prospects.
