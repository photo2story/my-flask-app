## Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX) Investment Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative therapies for serious diseases.

The cumulative return of VRTX (143.19%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 120.36%.  The difference is 22.8 percentage points.  This places the relative outperformance at the 55.6th percentile based on historical data (ranging from a minimum of -65.6% to a maximum of 93.5%). While a significant outperformance, the relative percentile indicates this level of outperformance is not unprecedented historically.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows a consistently positive alpha (0.1) across all periods, suggesting consistent outperformance relative to the market.  Beta remains consistently at 0.1, indicating very low market sensitivity. However, the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows some volatility, ranging from 14% to 99%.  The maximum drawdown (MDD) is also notable, with values reaching up to 66%, highlighting the inherent risk in biotech investments. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) is consistently at 110.0B, indicating a large-cap stock.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $420.55
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $409.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $451.04

The stock price is currently above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it is below its 60-day moving average, indicating a potential pullback from recent highs.  The recent price change of $1.39 represents a slight increase, not a significant jump.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 63.6 - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.9754 - A positive value suggests a bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +0.2 - This confirms a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 26.7% - This is a high expected return, suggesting significant potential long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, it's crucial to remember this is an *expected* return and not a guaranteed outcome.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  While Q1 2024 and Q3 2024 show strong EPS, Q2 2024 exhibits a substantial negative EPS. Revenue remains relatively consistent around $2.6 - $2.8B, suggesting a stable revenue stream.  The duplicate entry for 2024-11-05 needs clarification (possible data entry error).  A deeper dive into the reasons for the significant EPS fluctuation is required for a more informed assessment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX demonstrates strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  Positive alpha and high expected return are encouraging.  However, the volatility in EPS and ROE, along with significant MDD, highlights substantial risk.  Further investigation into the causes of the Q2 2024 negative EPS and fluctuating ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggests a potentially strong long-term investment, but considerable risk should be considered.  The inconsistent growth in equity is a red flag that needs addressing.  Thorough due diligence, including analyzing the company's pipeline and future growth prospects, is essential before investing.
