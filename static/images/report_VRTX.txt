| 2017-2019  | 99.0% | 18.8% | 67.0% | 0.1 | 109.0 |
| 2018-2020  | 30.0% | 30.2% | -3.0% | 0.1 | 109.0 |
| 2019-2021  | 14.0% | 33.8% | -66.0% | 0.1 | 109.0 |
| 2020-2022  | 16.0% | 33.8% | 9.0% | 0.1 | 109.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 84.0% | 20.6% | 60.0% | 0.1 | 109.0 |
| 2022-2024  | 78.0% | 23.0% | 56.0% | 0.1 | 109.0 |
| 2023-2025  | 55.0% | 23.0% | -14.0% | 0.1 | 109.0 |

The consistently low beta (around 0.1) suggests VRTX is less sensitive to overall market movements than the S&P 500.  However, Alpha fluctuates significantly, indicating periods of both strong outperformance and underperformance relative to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $422.0
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $417.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $410.496
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $451.8222

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  However, the recent price increase (from $416.96) indicates a possible short-term bounce.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.56 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.85 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +0.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 27.4% (significantly above S&P 500)

The positive PPO and upward relative strength suggest potential upside, though the RSI is not strongly indicative of an overbought or oversold condition.  The significant expected return highlights the potential for outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. The recent price increase of $1.21 is a relatively small percentage change (less than 0.3%) and does not suggest a significant "sharp uptrend".


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-11-05 | $4.05    | $2.77B        |
| 2024-08-02 | -$13.92   | $2.65B        |
| 2024-05-07 | $4.26    | $2.69B        |
| 2023-11-07 | $4.01    | $2.48B        |
| 2024-11-05 | $4.01    | $2.48B        | *(Duplicate entry - likely an error)*


Earnings are volatile, with a significant loss in Q2 2024.  Further investigation into the reasons for this loss is required.  Otherwise, revenue shows relatively consistent growth.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $15.63B | 6.69% |
| 2024-06-30 | $14.77B | -24.32% |
| 2024-03-31 | $18.55B | 5.93% |
| 2023-12-31 | $17.58B | 5.51% |

ROE is also volatile, mirroring the earnings volatility.  The negative ROE in Q2 2024 is a significant concern and requires further investigation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX demonstrates strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 historically.  However, recent earnings show significant volatility, particularly the substantial loss in Q2 2024, which needs further analysis to understand the underlying causes. The high and consistent profit margins are positive, but the fluctuating ROE warrants caution.  While the short-term outlook appears somewhat uncertain due to the recent price movement and volatile earnings, the long-term prospects remain promising, given the high projected returns and historically strong performance relative to the market.  A thorough investigation into the Q2 2024 loss is crucial before making any investment decisions.
