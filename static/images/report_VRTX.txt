**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows significant variations in CAGR, MDD (Maximum Drawdown), Alpha, and Beta across different time periods.  High CAGRs (e.g., 66%, 88%) are offset by periods of negative returns and substantial MDDs (e.g., -80%).  The consistently positive Alpha suggests VRTX has generated excess returns compared to the market benchmark, but the fluctuating Beta points to varying levels of market sensitivity.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, with a high cumulative return and positive Alpha. However, the high RSI suggests an overbought condition, implying potential short-term price correction.  The volatile earnings and ROE figures raise concerns and warrant further investigation into the underlying drivers of this volatility. The long-term outlook remains positive, supported by a high expected return, but careful consideration of the risks associated with the observed volatility is crucial.  Further due diligence, including analysis of the company's pipeline, competitive landscape, and regulatory environment, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistent earnings data warrants further investigation to identify underlying factors impacting profitability.
