Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the volatile earnings.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, with a positive alpha suggesting skillful management and exceeding market expectations. However, the significant volatility in earnings, ROE, and Beta necessitates caution.  The high profit margins are encouraging, but the recent negative ROE and volatile EPS are concerning.  Investors should carefully consider the inherent risks in the biotech sector and the companyâ€™s dependence on its pipeline of drugs for future growth.  The projected long-term return is positive, but thorough due diligence is essential before making any investment decisions. The current price being below its moving averages indicates a potential short-term downturn, but the overall long-term outlook could remain positive depending on the success of future drug development and regulatory approvals.
