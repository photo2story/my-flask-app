**7. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX shows a strong historical performance significantly exceeding the S&P 500.

The high expected return is promising but relies on the continuation of a long-term upward trend, which is not guaranteed.  More detailed information on recent news and analyst sentiment is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The conflicting signals (strong historical performance vs. recent negative trends) suggest a cautious approach is warranted.  Further due diligence, including examining the causes of the EPS and ROE volatility, is recommended before making any investment decision.
