**1. Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows strong historical performance for VRTX, consistently exceeding the benchmark (VOO).  However, Alpha and Beta fluctuate significantly year over year, suggesting the stock's performance is not solely driven by market movements (Beta) and is subject to significant company-specific factors (Alpha).

The earnings data shows significant volatility in EPS.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of this volatility, looking at factors such as one-time charges, changes in product sales, and research and development expenses. The consistent revenue growth is positive, but the inconsistent EPS raises concerns.  A detailed review of the company's financial statements is recommended.
