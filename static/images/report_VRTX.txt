**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

VRTX's cumulative return of 167.89% significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return of 120.40%. The difference is 47.5%, placing it at the 71st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  The provided alpha consistently shows positive outperformance relative to the market, though the beta is relatively low, suggesting the stock’s price is less volatile than the overall market.  However, note that periods of substantial underperformance relative to the market have also occurred (2019-2021).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $469.22
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $465.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $465.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $472.17

The stock price is currently slightly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend. However, it's trading above both its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating relatively strong near-term support.  The last market price of $469.29 is not significantly different from the closing price, thus no significant recent price jump or drop is observed.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 65.62 –  Suggests the stock is in slightly overbought territory, indicating a potential for a short-term pullback.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.23 – A positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence:** +4.6 – Shows a short-term upward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return:** 79.7% –  This represents a significant long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500 if the projected return holds true, assuming continued investment.  However, this is a projection and not a guarantee.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in EPS.  While there are positive EPS figures for several quarters, a large negative EPS was reported in Q2 2024 (-13.92). Revenue shows a generally upward trend, though there is some fluctuation.  There's not enough information to assess whether these results beat or missed expectations.  A deeper dive into analyst expectations would be needed to make that determination.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:**  Revenue is generally increasing, although there are some minor fluctuations quarter-to-quarter.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins remain consistently high (above 85%), suggesting strong profitability.
* **Equity:** Equity shows fluctuation; further analysis is needed to understand the underlying drivers.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is highly variable, with one quarter showing a significant negative value (-24.32%). This warrants further investigation into the cause of this negative ROE.  Further analysis into balance sheet details would be beneficial.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, although there have been periods of substantial underperformance. Recent price action shows a generally positive trend, but the RSI suggests potential short-term overbought conditions.  The high and relatively stable profit margins are a positive sign. However, the significant volatility in EPS and ROE, coupled with the lack of detailed news and analyst information, requires further investigation before making a definitive investment recommendation. The provided expected return is a projection and should be treated as such, not a guarantee.  More comprehensive financial statements and further research into the drivers of financial fluctuations are crucial for a complete analysis.
