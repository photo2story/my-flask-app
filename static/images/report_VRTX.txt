VRTX demonstrates a strong track record of outperforming the S&P 500, backed by high expected returns. While recent earnings and ROE show some volatility,  the consistently high profit margins and revenue growth indicate a fundamentally sound business.  However, further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the Q2 2024 EPS loss and negative ROE. A deeper dive into the company's specific product pipeline and market dynamics, along with a review of any relevant news or announcements, would provide a more comprehensive assessment.  Despite the short-term volatility, the long-term outlook for VRTX appears positive.
