**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  While there were strong EPS figures in several quarters (e.g., $4.05 and $4.26), a notably negative EPS of -$13.92 in Q2 2024 warrants further investigation.  The revenue consistently remains above $2.4 Billion, suggesting a generally healthy revenue stream.  Further investigation is needed to understand the cause of the outlier negative EPS.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue remains consistently high, with strong profit margins. However, the Equity and ROE figures exhibit some variability, particularly the large negative ROE in Q2 2024 that requires further investigation (potential one-time event or accounting change needs to be considered).

**6. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX has demonstrated strong historical growth, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests a short-term correction.  The mixed signals from the earnings data (particularly the Q2 2024 negative EPS) and the ROE volatility warrant closer examination.  While the long-term outlook appears positive, supported by a high expected return, potential investors should carefully analyze the reasons behind the recent volatility and the significant negative EPS before making any investment decisions.  Further investigation into the specific drivers of revenue and the factors influencing profitability and equity is crucial.  A deep dive into the company's filings and news releases would provide a more complete picture.
