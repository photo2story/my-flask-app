The difference is 27.7%, placing it at the 58.6th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The high RSI and the slight price drop suggest caution. While momentum is positive, the risk of a correction is elevated.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in EPS.  While there are some high positive EPS figures, there is also a substantial negative value in Q2 2024 (-$13.92).  Revenue growth seems relatively consistent, but profitability fluctuates considerably.  Further investigation is required to understand the reasons behind these EPS fluctuations, potentially looking at one-time charges or changes in accounting practices.  Note that there is a duplicate entry for 2024-11-05. This inconsistency needs clarification.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX shows strong long-term growth potential, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent data reveals some warning signs. The high RSI suggests the stock is overbought, and the recent negative price movement, coupled with the volatile earnings (especially the substantial Q2 2024 loss), necessitates a cautious approach.  The significant fluctuations in Equity and ROE also raise concerns.  Further investigation into the causes of the Q2 2024 losses and the volatility in key financial metrics is crucial before making any investment decisions.  While the long-term outlook appears positive, the short-term risk of a correction should be considered.  A thorough analysis of the Q2 2024 earnings report and a deeper dive into the company's financial statements is recommended.
