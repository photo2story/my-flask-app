**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue        |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| 2024-11-05 | $4.05     | $2.77 Billion  |
| 2024-08-02 | -$13.92   | $2.65 Billion  |

| 2024-11-05 | $4.01     | $2.48 Billion  | *(Duplicate entry, potential data error)*


Earnings show volatility, with a significant negative EPS in August 2024. This requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes.  The duplication of the November 2024 data also needs clarification.  Revenue shows steady growth, however.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $2.91 Billion | 85.46%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $2.77 Billion | 85.84%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $2.65 Billion | 85.94%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $2.69 Billion | 87.27%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B) | ROE (%) |

| 2024-09-30 | $15.63     | 6.69    |
| 2024-06-30 | $14.77     | -24.32   |

| 2023-12-31 | $17.58     | 5.51    |

Revenue shows consistent growth, and profit margins remain high.  However, the ROE is volatile, with a significant negative value in Q2 2024. This warrants further investigation into the underlying factors impacting profitability.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX has demonstrated strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, as evidenced by significantly higher cumulative returns and generally positive Alpha values.  While recent price action shows a short-term decline, long-term indicators (60-day MA) suggest potential upward momentum.  High profit margins and growing revenue are positive signs. However, the volatile earnings, particularly the negative EPS in Q3 2024, and the fluctuating ROE require further investigation to assess the risk profile.  The high Maximum Drawdown in the past highlights the inherent risk associated with this stock.  The 21% projected long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500 remains a compelling aspect.  Investors should carefully consider the risk-reward profile before making investment decisions, particularly considering the significant volatility observed in certain metrics.  Further due diligence, including an examination of the reasons behind the negative EPS and ROE, is strongly recommended.
