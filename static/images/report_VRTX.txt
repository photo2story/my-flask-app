**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 461.71 (Last Market: 462.06)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 452.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 477.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 473.99

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 34.77 (Below 50, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.89 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** -9.45% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 17.8% (above S&P 500)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest potential for a short-term rebound, however, this is influenced heavily by the recent negative performance and the substantial deviation from the average performance.  The 462.06 price does not indicate a significant sudden upward or downward movement. The expected return is notably positive against the S&P 500.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term, as evidenced by its high cumulative return. However, recent performance has been more volatile.  While the current price is below its moving averages, the oversold RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce. Long-term prospects are potentially positive given the strong expected return, though further analysis of the recent negative EPS and overall financial health are required.  The large fluctuations in the relative outperformance relative to the S&P 500 should be noted.  A deeper dive into recent news, analyst ratings, and the specifics of the Q2 2024 earnings report are necessary for a comprehensive evaluation.
