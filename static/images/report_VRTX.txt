**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

VRTX has shown strong cumulative returns, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.

Further information is needed on recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and the specific reasons for the Q2 EPS drop to provide a more comprehensive assessment.  The missing data regarding earnings expectations, recent news and analyst opinions prevents a full evaluation of the stock's performance and future prospects.
