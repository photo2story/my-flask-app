## Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative therapies for serious diseases.

The cumulative return of VRTX is 139.84%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 118.37%.  The difference is 21.5%, placing it in the 54.7th percentile of the historical performance range (max 93.5%, min -65.6%). This indicates that VRTX's outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is above average historically, but not exceptionally high compared to its historical range.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently positive alpha (ranging from -66% to 67%), suggesting that VRTX has generated returns above what would be expected based solely on its beta (market risk).  Beta remains consistently around 0.1, indicating low correlation with the overall market.  This low beta is a notable feature, suggesting the stock's returns are less sensitive to market fluctuations.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $422.00
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $417.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $410.50
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $451.82

The price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent downward trend.  The relatively small gap between the 5-day and 20-day averages, however, indicates that the short-term downtrend is not extremely steep.  The larger gap to the 60-day average indicates a more significant longer-term correction.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 58.56 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.85 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +0.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 27.4% (significantly above the market's implicit expectation given the relative performance against the S&P 500). The closing price of $422 does not suggest immediate dramatic price changes based on the surrounding indicators. However, continued monitoring is needed.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicates.  There appears to be a data entry error, as the same data point (2024-11-05, 4.01, 2.48 B$) is listed twice.  A reliable analysis cannot be performed until this inconsistency is resolved.  Inconsistency in EPS, with a significant negative EPS in August 2024,  requires further investigation to identify the cause.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue has been relatively stable, hovering around $2.6 Billion. Profit margins are consistently high (85-87%), indicating strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:**  Equity fluctuates, and ROE shows significant variability, even dipping into negative territory in Q2 2024 (-24.32%).  This requires further investigation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

VRTX has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term. However, recent price action shows a downward trend, potentially indicating a period of consolidation or correction after a strong prior period of growth.  Technical indicators are mostly neutral, suggesting neither strong bullish nor bearish signals. The expected return is considerable. The inconsistent earnings data and the volatile ROE require further investigation before making any definitive conclusions.  Due to the erratic EPS figures, deeper dive into the quarterly reports is necessary to ascertain the true financial health. This analysis highlights the need for due diligence before any investment decision.
