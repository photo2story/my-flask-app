Further investigation into the reasons for this negative quarter is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high expected long-term return is promising, but the risk associated with the recent earnings needs to be carefully considered.  A thorough review of the Q2 2024 results, including an explanation for the negative EPS and ROE, is essential for a comprehensive assessment.
