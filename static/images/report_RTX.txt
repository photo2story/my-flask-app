**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the analyzed period. While recent earnings show some variability, the overall financial picture requires deeper analysis.

Before making any investment decisions, a more thorough examination of the company's fundamentals, competitive landscape, and industry outlook is crucial.  The provided data suggests caution, especially given the relatively high beta values indicating significant market sensitivity.
