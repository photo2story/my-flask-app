## RTX Corp (RTX) Stock Review

This report analyzes RTX Corp (RTX), a leading aerospace and defense company, based on the provided data.  Note that this analysis is solely based on the data provided and may not reflect a complete picture of the company's performance and outlook.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

RTX's cumulative return of 69.03% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return of 117.56% over the analyzed period. The difference is -48.5%, placing it at the 24.8th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. This indicates that RTX's performance has lagged behind the broader market.  The provided alpha values consistently near zero suggest that RTX's returns have largely tracked the market, with limited outperformance or underperformance attributable to factors specific to the company itself.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $116.63
* **Last Market Price:** $116.83
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $116.09
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $117.87
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $121.19

The price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The relatively small difference between the closing price and the last market price indicates minimal intraday price fluctuations around the close.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 44.85 – Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so.
* **PPO:** -0.04 –  Indicates a weak bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +2.9 – Shows a short-term upward trend in relative performance against the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% –  The provided data suggests no significant expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).

The provided information does not indicate a significant immediate price surge or crash.  The slightly elevated price relative to the last market price might be within normal variation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue:

* **Revenue Growth:**  Revenue shows a generally upward trend, with a notable drop in Q3 2023. The most recent quarter (Q3 2024) shows revenue growth compared to the previous quarter.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS shows significant fluctuations, including a substantial negative EPS in Q3 2023, followed by a significant rebound in subsequent quarters.  The most recent EPS is significantly positive.
* **Comparison:** The data lacks comparative data (e.g., against expectations) which would provide stronger insights into performance.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has shown consistent growth (excluding the dip in Q3 2023), with a corresponding increase in profit margin during most quarters, indicating improving profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity fluctuates, and ROE has shown variability, including a negative ROE in Q3 2023, followed by recovery in later periods.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  A lack of information on market outlook hinders a thorough assessment of current sentiment.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

RTX's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While recent earnings show improved revenue and profitability compared to the significant dip in Q3 2023, the overall picture is still mixed. The technical indicators suggest a weak bearish momentum but are not decisively negative. The long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is projected as neutral (0%). Further information, including analyst ratings and market outlook, would be necessary for a more comprehensive evaluation. The volatility in earnings and ROE highlights a degree of risk associated with the stock.
