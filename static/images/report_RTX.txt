4. **Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date | EPS | Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08 | 19.72 B$ |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29 | 19.30 B$ |

The latest earnings report for Q2 2024 (ended July 25th, 2024) showed EPS of $0.08, significantly below the analyst expectation of $1.07. This sharp decline in earnings, coupled with a slight decrease in revenue, indicates potential challenges for the company.

**Overall Analysis:**

While RTX has shown some short-term strength, the overbought RSI level and the recent earnings miss suggest potential for a near-term pullback. Despite this, the positive PPO and high expected return indicate long-term growth potential. Investors should carefully monitor the stock's price action and consider the risks associated with the current market conditions.  It is recommended to wait for a potential pullback or a positive catalyst before entering a long position.
