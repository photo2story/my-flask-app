**1. Performance Comparison and Outperformance:**

RTX Corp, a leading aerospace and defense company, shows a cumulative return of 72.07% over the analyzed period.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.78%, RTX underperformed by 49.7 percentage points.  The relative underperformance is positioned at the 23.1 percentile of the historical range (-66.1% to 4.8%).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows consistently low or near-zero alpha values, suggesting that RTX's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta).  Beta values generally hover around 1, reflecting a similar level of volatility to the market.  The significant negative CAGR in 2018-2020 highlights a period of underperformance compared to the other periods.  Note that the data lacks information on the benchmark used for Alpha calculation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $118.11
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $117.29
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $118.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $121.13

The stock price is currently trading slightly below its 20-day moving average and significantly below its 60-day moving average, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 48.30 (Slightly below neutral; not indicating strong overbought or oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.06 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +2.1% (Suggests a recent short-term upward trend)

Given the current price of $118.11 is not significantly different from the moving averages, there is no evidence of a sharp rebound or decline. The expected return is 0.0%, implying no significant outperformance compared to the S&P 500 is expected over the long term (2+ years). This is consistent with the low alpha observed in the historical data.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  Revenue has generally increased, with the exception of the 2023-09-30 quarter which indicates a big potential dip for that period. EPS figures also show large swings, including negative EPS in both the 2023-10-24 and 2024-07-25 quarters.  The significant jump in EPS from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024 needs to be further analyzed to understand if it is consistent with trends or an outlier.  Without comparative expectations, it's impossible to determine whether these results were "beats" or "misses".

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue shows consistent growth, except for a notable drop in Q3 2023. Profit margins also fluctuate, but generally show a healthy level aside from the Q3 2023 results. Equity values are relatively stable, while ROE has demonstrated variability, showing both positive and negative values throughout the year, hinting at fluctuating profitability and possibly impacting the previously mentioned variations of EPS results.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp has shown a history of significant volatility and varying performance compared to the S&P 500. While revenue has generally trended upward, the volatility in EPS and profit margins, and notably the significant drop in both revenue and profit margin in Q3 2023, signal a degree of risk. The low alpha indicates that the stock's performance is primarily driven by market movements.  Currently, technical indicators are neutral, with the price slightly below its moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short term.  Long-term performance compared to the S&P 500 is expected to be roughly in line with the market, based on the provided data.  Additional information on recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.
