**7. Overall Analysis:**

RTX has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the provided time period.

The negative long-term expected return (-105.2%) is extremely concerning and requires further investigation to verify its validity and underlying assumptions.  Technical indicators suggest a potential downward trend, but are not definitive.  Crucially, missing context on recent news, analyst opinions, and the methodology used to calculate the expected return prevents a complete and accurate assessment.  Further research is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
