| 2023-2025  | 31.0%     | 69.7%  | -18.0%  | 2.2   | 210.9  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha values indicate that RTX has generally underperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis across different periods.
*   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuate, suggesting varying degrees of correlation with the market. Notably low Beta values (close to 0) in some periods may indicate that RTX's returns are relatively independent of overall market movements during those times. Higher Beta values (e.g., 1.2 and 2.2 in recent years) suggest increased sensitivity to market changes.
*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows periods of growth and decline, highlighting the stock's volatility.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values consistently indicate significant potential losses, with values around 60-70% suggesting substantial risk.
*   **Cap:** The market capitalization has varied, reflecting changes in investor valuation and overall market conditions. The recent increase to 210.9B suggests growing investor confidence or market expansion.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movement:**

*   **Current Price:** 157.57
*   **Previous Close:** 158.4
*   **Change:** -0.52
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 157.21
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 151.33
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 142.58

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly down from the previous close. The 5-day moving average is above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, and the 20-day is above the 60-day, suggesting a short-term upward trend, but the small negative change from the previous day indicates slight volatility.

**3. Market Risk Indicators:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3295 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 73.78 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.2438
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.33)
*   **20-day Relative Deviation Change:** +6.1 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -167.3%

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates low market risk. However, the RSI of 73.78 suggests the stock is currently overbought and may be due for a correction. The Hybrid Signal recommends a high allocation to the stock, reflecting the low-risk assessment. The recent increase in the 20-day relative deviation suggests a short-term upward trend. Critically, the very negative expected return of -167.3% suggests significant long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500. The price change of -0.52, while small, adds to the concern about potential near-term volatility given the overbought RSI.

*   **July 28, 2025:** Analyst discussions on performance and outlook.
