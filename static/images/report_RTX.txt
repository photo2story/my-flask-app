## RTX Corp Stock Review

**0. Overview:**

RTX Corporation (formerly Raytheon Technologies) is a major aerospace and defense company.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

RTX's cumulative return of 87.22% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 119.91%. The difference is -32.7%, placing it at the 47.2nd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-66.2% to 4.8%).  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values across different periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others show negative alpha, suggesting inconsistent outperformance relative to the market. Beta values are generally around 1, indicating a similar volatility to the market, although it fluctuates.  The significant negative alpha in 2018-2020 coincides with a large maximum drawdown (MDD).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $128.95
* **5-day Moving Average:** $127.29
* **20-day Moving Average:** $121.39
* **60-day Moving Average:** $119.52

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The small negative change from the previous close (-$0.02) is insignificant.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (76.29):**  Indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.
* **PPO (0.69):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (10.6,+):** Shows a recent increase in relative strength.

The combination of overbought RSI and positive PPO and relative divergence suggests caution.  While momentum is positive, the risk of a short-term correction is high.

**Expected Return (-32.5%):** This represents the projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data is inconsistent, with significant swings between positive and negative EPS. Revenue shows a general upward trend, except for a dip in Q3 2023.  The duplicated entry for 2024-10-22 needs clarification.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX has shown inconsistent performance relative to the S&P 500, with periods of both outperformance and significant underperformance. While recent price action suggests a short-term uptrend, technical indicators suggest caution due to overbought conditions. Earnings and financial data reveal volatility and a significant dip in Q3 2023.  The -32.5% expected return relative to the S&P 500 indicates a substantial long-term underperformance risk. Further investigation into the causes of the Q3 2023 dip and the inconsistent earnings is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated earnings data requires clarification.
