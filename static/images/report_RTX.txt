A comparison with analysts' expectations for the October 2024 earnings is crucial for a complete picture (this information is not provided).

* **Capital & Profitability:**  Return on Equity (ROE) has shown considerable variability, reflecting the fluctuating profitability of the business.  The substantial drop in equity in Q3 2023, followed by a bounce back is also something requiring investigation.

The provided data suggests that, based on past trends, significant long-term alpha relative to the S&P 500 is unlikely.  More data, particularly analyst estimates and market outlook, are required to refine this assessment.
