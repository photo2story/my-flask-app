## RTX Corp Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

RTX Corp, a leading aerospace and defense company, shows a cumulative return significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While specifics on the timeframe are missing, the substantial negative divergence highlights underperformance relative to the broader market.  Further investigation is needed to determine the drivers behind this.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

* **Cumulative Return (RTX):** 39.87%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 87.98%
* **Divergence:** -48.1% (relative divergence of 37.5% indicating it's performing below the benchmark, but not at its historical worst).

The provided alpha and beta data reveals a mixed picture.  While positive alpha values suggest outperformance in some periods (2015-2017, 2016-2018, 2017-2019), significant negative alpha is observed in others (2018-2020, 2020-2022).  The beta consistently hovers around 1, suggesting similar volatility to the market, although this fluctuates. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows considerable growth.  Further analysis is needed to understand the changing alpha and its drivers.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $128.63
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $126.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $127.99

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent price stability or a minor upward trend. The price is close to the 60-day moving average, indicating that the price remains relatively stable within the short to medium term.

* **RSI:** 49.7 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.47 (Positive, indicating potential upward momentum)
* **Relative Strength Divergence (20-day):** -1.0 (Short-term downward pressure)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -71.6%  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 requires further investigation and clarification. The timeframe and underlying assumptions need to be understood.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2025-04-22 and inconsistent EPS values.  Further clarification on the data accuracy is necessary. Revenue shows a relatively stable trend. A more detailed analysis including year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter comparisons is needed.

Equity shows a reasonably stable trend, although there's some fluctuation. ROE also exhibits variability, with a notably low value in Q2 2024. This requires further investigation to understand the underlying causes.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX's performance lags behind the S&P 500, with a significant negative divergence. While some periods show positive alpha, suggesting outperformance, other periods reveal considerable underperformance.  The relatively stable price movement, neutral RSI, and positive PPO signal a mixed outlook.  However, the extremely negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern and needs thorough explanation.  Inconsistent and potentially erroneous data in earnings and financial statements necessitates verification. A comprehensive analysis requiring more robust and accurate data is crucial for a conclusive assessment.  Furthermore, understanding the time horizon for the provided data (e.g., for the cumulative returns and Alpha/Beta analysis) and clarifying inconsistencies is crucial for a meaningful interpretation.
