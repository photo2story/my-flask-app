**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha indicates RTX has underperformed relative to its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) over these periods.
*   **Beta:** Beta values fluctuate, sometimes exceeding 1, which means RTX's volatility has occasionally been higher than the market.

**2. Recent Stock Price Movements**

*   **Current Price:** \$157.95
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: \$157.95, Previous Close: \$157.05, Change: 0.57
*   **Moving Averages:**
    *   5-day: \$158.05
    *   20-day: \$162.73
    *   60-day: \$158.73

**Analysis:**  The price closed slightly higher than the previous day. The 5-day moving average is slightly below the 60-day, and both are below the 20-day moving average. This *could* indicate a short-term downtrend or consolidation phase, although the differences are small.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5 (Low Investment)
*   **RSI:** 29.90 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.76
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  Cash 70%, Sell 69.9% of holdings
*   **Recent Relative Deviation Change (20-day):** -7.2 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -356.4% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:**  Suggests a "Low Investment" recommendation, indicating perceived risk.
*   **RSI:**  The RSI indicates an oversold condition, which *could* suggest a potential for a price rebound. However, in a downtrend, oversold conditions can persist.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:**  This strongly leans toward reducing holdings and increasing cash, reinforcing the cautious outlook.
*   **Relative Deviation Change:** Confirms recent underperformance relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:**  A highly negative expected return indicates significant concern.  It suggests that, under current conditions, analysts anticipate RTX to *substantially* underperform the S&P 500 over the long term.
*   **Last Market Data:**  The increase of 0.57 is not high enough to trigger any special issue.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **GTF Advantage Engine Certification:** News focuses on the EU clearing Pratt & Whitney’s GTF Advantage Engine for Commercial Launch and its potential impact on RTX's profitability and aftermarket strategy.  This is a significant event that could influence future revenue streams.
*   **General Market News:** Includes broader market updates, inflation reports, and earnings previews of other companies (Tesla, Intel, Northrop).

**Analysis:** The GTF engine news appears to be a key driver for RTX, and its valuation is being re-evaluated based on this. The other news provides context for the overall market environment.

    *   Key: Buy
    *   Mean: 1.89 (~Buy)

    *   Target Price (avg/high/low): \$175.33 / \$200.00 / \$150.00

**Analysis:** Analyst consensus remains positive, with a "Buy" rating and a target price significantly above the current price. This presents a mixed picture, as the data suggests caution, but analysts see potential upside.
