## RTX Corp Stock Report

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

RTX Corp (formerly Raytheon Technologies) is a major aerospace and defense company.  The provided data shows a recent cumulative return significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

RTX's cumulative return (83.12%) lags behind the S&P 500's (85.44%) by -2.3%, placing it at the 76.6th percentile of its historical range of underperformance (-57% to +14.4%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market.  Positive alphas in some periods (2016-2018, 2017-2019, 2021-2023, 2022-2024, 2023-2025) indicate outperformance, while negative alphas (2018-2020, 2019-2021, 2020-2022) show underperformance. The high beta values (generally above 70) suggest high sensitivity to market movements.  Market capitalization fluctuates significantly throughout the observation period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $130.23
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $132.08
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $131.88
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $127.31

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it's above its 60-day moving average, indicating some longer-term support.  A recent price drop of -$2.19 (from $133.15) shows a mild decline.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 50.60 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.35 (Negative; indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -7.6% (Long-term, 2+ years, relative to S&P 500)  This suggests potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a longer-term investment horizon. The recent price drop is already reflected in this estimate.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows mixed signals.  While revenue and (generally) profit margins are healthy, earnings are volatile and the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 recently.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment.  The long-term expected return is negative relative to the S&P 500. The high beta indicates significant market sensitivity.  Further investigation is needed to clarify the inconsistent earnings data and assess the long-term prospects, considering the company's position within the aerospace and defense industry and potential future growth drivers.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data requires correction or explanation.
