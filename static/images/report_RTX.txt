*   **Technical Indicators:** MRI indicates a low-risk market, but the RSI is approaching overbought levels, and the PPO remains negative.

*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major concern.

**Conclusion:**

RTX presents a mixed picture. While there's recent upward momentum, the long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500, high volatility, and especially the highly negative expected return are concerning. The recent news and earnings volatility add further uncertainty. The hybrid signal recommending a high cash position reflects this uncertainty. Investors should exercise caution and conduct further due diligence before considering an investment in RTX. The significant recent price increase needs to be evaluated in the context of these overall concerns.
