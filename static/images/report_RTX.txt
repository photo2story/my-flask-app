2025-10-24 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's an analysis of RTX Corp (Raytheon Technologies), incorporating all the provided data points.  The report is in English and includes numerical summaries followed by analysis.

**Executive Summary**

RTX Corp (RTX) is an aerospace and defense company that provides advanced technology and services for commercial, military, and government customers worldwide. While RTX's returns have significantly lagged the S&P 500 (VOO), recent analyst ratings and positive earnings momentum suggest a potential upside. However, the mixed technical indicators and negative expected return warrant careful consideration.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **RTX Cumulative Return:** 30.39%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 99.09%
*   **Current Deviation:** -70.0
*   **Relative Deviation:** 9.0

**Analysis:**

RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.  The current deviation of -70.0 indicates substantial underperformance. The relative deviation of 9.0 suggests that this underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range compared to the S&P 500, which could imply a potential for catching up, but it does not guarantee it.

*   **CAGR:** Wide variability in Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) indicates inconsistent performance.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values suggest significant risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha values indicate underperformance relative to a benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Fluctuating Beta values show varying degrees of correlation with the market.  Higher betas (close to 1 or above) in more recent periods (2020-2023) suggest increased market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Action**

*   **Current Price:** 173.04
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 179.44, Previous Close: 177.98, Change: 0.82
*   **5-day Moving Average:** 161.15
*   **20-day Moving Average:** 163.32
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 159.08

**Analysis:**

The stock is trading above its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting an upward trend in the short to medium term.  The recent "Last-market" data indicates a recent positive price movement (price increase of 0.82 from 177.98 to 179.44). The current price (173.04) is a little lower than the "Last-market" price (179.44). This could be because of market hours.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 58.34 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.0414 (Positive)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Very Safe)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Deviation Change:** -4.8 (Short-term Decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** -513.1% (vs. S&P 500, Long-Term)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, indicating low perceived risk.
*   RSI is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   PPO is positive, suggesting a bullish trend.
*   The hybrid signal further supports a buy recommendation.
*   However, the negative change in relative deviation suggests recent underperformance relative to the benchmark.
*   The extremely negative expected return is concerning, suggesting significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon. This should be heavily scrutinized and investigated.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive:** Jim Cramer says "It's the Perfect Time for RTX". Honeywell's earnings beat estimates due to aerospace momentum. Aerospace & Defense ETFs are in focus.
*   **Negative:** Hexcel's earnings missed estimates and lowered EPS view.

**Analysis:**

Recent news presents a mixed picture.  Positive sentiment from Jim Cramer and strong performance from Honeywell in the aerospace sector are positive indicators for the industry and potentially RTX. However, negative news from Hexcel, a supplier, could indicate potential headwinds. The general focus on Aerospace & Defense ETFs signals industry-wide attention.

**4.2 Analyst Opinions**
