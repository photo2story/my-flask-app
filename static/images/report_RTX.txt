**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuating CAGR indicates inconsistent growth. Recent years (2018-2024) show negative CAGR values, suggesting periods of decline.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates significant risk and volatility. The high drawdowns mean investors experienced substantial losses during these periods.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha suggests underperformance relative to its benchmark index (S&P 500). The negative values mean RTX has not generated excess returns compared to the benchmark.
*   **Beta:** Beta values vary, indicating changing sensitivity to market movements. Values close to 1 suggest market-like volatility, while higher values (e.g., 1.4 in 2020-2022) indicate higher volatility compared to the market. Negative Beta in 2017-2019 indicates an inverse relationship to the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Increasing market capitalization over time suggests growing investor interest and confidence in the company's prospects, despite the volatility and underperformance issues.

*   **5-day SMA:** 172.116
*   **20-day SMA:** 172.653
*   **60-day SMA:** 169.6355

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently above all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day), which could suggest an upward trend. However, the 5-day and 20-day SMAs are relatively close, indicating recent price consolidation. The "Last-Market" data shows a slight increase, confirming the recent upward movement.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 51.82
*   **PPO:** -0.0445

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -4.9 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -1093.1 (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term (more than 2 years) from this point.)

**Analysis:**

*   **RSI:** An RSI of 51.82 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A slightly negative PPO (-0.0445) suggests a minor bearish trend or potential weakening of momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests a bullish investment strategy of buying RTX now.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** A negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days indicates that RTX has been underperforming the S&P 500 in the short term.
*   **Expected Return:** The very large negative expected return is a major red flag. It strongly suggests that, based on current models and data, RTX is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term. This warrants careful scrutiny.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **AWS Cloud Partnership Opinions:** Mixed opinions on the partnership suggest uncertainty about its immediate impact.
*   **Trending Stock:** The stock's trending status indicates increased attention, which can lead to volatility.

*   **Fresh 'Buy' Rating from Citigroup:** A 'Buy' rating from a reputable firm can positively influence investor sentiment.

**Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. While there are positive catalysts like partnerships and analyst upgrades, the focus on the stock as "trending" can also indicate speculative interest. The mention of the F-35 engine deal is significant, as defense contracts are a major revenue driver for RTX.

The average target price of $194.65 indicates potential upside from the current price of $178.66. However, the wide range between the high and low target prices ($217.00 and $150.00, respectively) indicates considerable uncertainty among analysts. The absence of rating changes is not information.
