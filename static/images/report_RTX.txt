## RTX Corp (RTX) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes RTX Corp (RTX), a leading provider of aerospace and defense products and services, based on the provided data.  Note that this analysis is limited to the information provided and may not reflect a complete picture.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

RTX Corp's cumulative return of 69.15% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's return of 118.39%. The difference is -49.2%, placing it in the 23.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data. This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.  Alpha consistently hovers around zero, indicating that the stock's performance is largely explained by market movements (Beta also close to zero).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $116.71
* **5-day Moving Average:** $116.74
* **20-day Moving Average:** $117.42
* **60-day Moving Average:** $120.87

The price is slightly below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (44.94):**  Indicates the stock is nearing oversold territory, but not definitively so.
* **PPO (0.10):** A positive value suggests a bullish momentum, albeit weak.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (-3.0):** Shows a recent minor downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (-90.2%):**  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern and warrants further investigation into the basis of this calculation.  The extremely negative figure suggests a major divergence from expected market returns and should be critically examined before acting upon it.  A 2-year+ investment horizon would still be subject to this substantial projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The implication is that significant improvement in RTX's performance is required to overcome this projected shortfall.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals significant volatility:

* **Revenue:** Shows fluctuating growth, with a sharp drop in Q3 2023 ($13.46B) compared to previous and subsequent quarters.  The most recent quarter shows a significant rebound.
* **EPS:**  Highly volatile, swinging from positive to negative values across quarters, suggesting operational challenges. Notably, EPS increased sharply in Q4 2024, compared to the prior quarter.  The repetition of the Q3 2023 EPS in Q4 2024 is unusual and requires further investigation of the source data for accuracy.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue shows growth, but profit margins experienced a substantial decline in Q3 2023, recovering in subsequent quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity fluctuates, while Return on Equity (ROE) is inconsistent, showing a negative value in Q3 2023.  The most recent quarter shows a low but positive ROE.

The financial data indicates periods of strong performance and significant drops, highlighting operational risks and variability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires additional information. The report needs details on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to complete a comprehensive analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows mixed signals. While recent revenue and EPS have rebounded from the Q3 2023 lows,  the long-term performance relative to the S&P 500 is significantly underperforming, as indicated by the negative expected return.  Technical indicators suggest a slightly bearish short-term trend.  The significant volatility in both revenue and earnings necessitates a cautious approach.  The provided negative expected return necessitates thorough investigation into its calculation and underlying assumptions, as this projection is extremely severe.  More information on recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a more complete assessment.


**8. Conclusion:**

Based on the limited data, a definitive investment recommendation cannot be made. Further investigation into the unusually negative projected return, the repetitive EPS figure from Q3 2023, and the inclusion of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The substantial volatility in financial performance warrants close monitoring of future earnings reports and market trends.
