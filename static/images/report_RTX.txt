   **Analysis:** The most recent earnings report (2024-07-25) showed a significant decline in EPS compared to the previous quarter.

**Overall Analysis:**

RTX is currently trading in overbought territory with a mixed bag of technical indicators. While recent earnings have been disappointing, the company's revenue growth and potential for long-term growth in the AI and gaming markets offer some bullish sentiment. The stock's underperformance relative to the S&P 500 suggests potential for a correction in the short term. However, long-term investors may find the company's future prospects compelling, considering its dominance in the GPU market and the growing demand for AI solutions.
