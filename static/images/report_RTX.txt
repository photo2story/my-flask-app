## RTX Corp Stock Review

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes RTX Corporation (RTX), comparing its performance to the S&P 500 (VOO) using provided financial data.  We will examine key metrics including cumulative return, alpha and beta, recent price movements, technical indicators, recent earnings, and financial information.

**1) Cumulative Return and S&P 500 Comparison:**

RTX Corp is an aerospace and defense company.

* **RTX Cumulative Return:** 36.75%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 82.57%
* **Return Difference:** -45.8%

RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered.  The relative divergence of -40.1% indicates that RTX's performance lies in the lower 40.1% of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 32.0% | 56.7% | 0.0% | 0.1 | 90.1 |
| 2016-2018  | 22.0% | 64.0% | 1.0% | 0.5 | 76.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 37.0% | 64.0% | 3.0% | 1.0 | 110.6 |
| 2018-2020  | -24.0% | 64.0% | -54.0% | 1.2 | 86.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 15.0% | 61.4% | -46.0% | 1.4 | 106.4 |
| 2020-2022  | -13.0% | 69.5% | -22.0% | 1.4 | 127.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 2.0% | 69.5% | -19.0% | 1.1 | 109.3 |
| 2022-2024  | -1.0% | 69.9% | -22.0% | 0.7 | 153.8 |
| 2023-2025  | 8.0% | 69.9% | -0.0% | 0.7 | 162.9 |

The data shows considerable volatility in both CAGR and Alpha, indicating periods of both outperformance and significant underperformance compared to the benchmark.  Beta values generally suggest a higher sensitivity to market movements than the market average (Beta >1).  The recent negative Alpha suggests underperformance compared to the market in the recent period.

**2) Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $121.97
* **Last Market Price:** $130.21 (2.2% increase from previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $122.20
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $126.54
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $128.09

The recent price of $130.21 shows a significant jump from the previous close, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend. However, the price is still below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downward pressure.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 42.10 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.6603 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -16.1% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -63.7% (Significant negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term)

The technical indicators show mixed signals.  The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest bearish momentum, while the recent price jump contradicts this somewhat.  The significantly negative expected return highlights the potential for long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500. The recent price increase of 2.2% should be noted as a potentially temporary upward shift.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-04-22 | 1.15 | 20.31 B$ |
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1 | 20.09 B$ |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08 | 19.72 B$ |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29 | 19.30 B$ |
| 2025-04-22 | 1.29 | 19.30 B$ |

There is an inconsistency in the data; there are two entries for 2025-04-22 with different EPS values.  The data shows some volatility in EPS and relatively stable revenue. Further investigation is needed to clarify the discrepancies and fully interpret the earnings trend.

**5) Financial Information:**

| 2024-06-30 | $19.72B | 18.15% |

Revenue shows some fluctuation, while profit margins generally remain healthy but have seen some slight decline in recent quarters.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|

Equity shows some variability, and ROE is generally low, particularly a significant dip in Q2 2024.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the period analyzed, with considerable volatility in performance.  While recent earnings have been somewhat stable, there are inconsistencies in the data requiring further investigation. Technical indicators point towards mixed signals, with the recent price jump contrasting with bearish momentum suggested by RSI and PPO.  The significantly negative expected return raises concerns regarding long-term investment.  A more in-depth analysis, including clarification of data discrepancies, and a broader review of macroeconomic factors influencing the aerospace and defense sector, would be beneficial to form a more robust conclusion.  The current data suggests a cautious approach to investment in RTX Corp.
