RTX exhibits strong recent revenue and profit growth, but its cumulative return lags significantly behind the S&P 500.

The -32.5% expected return reflects a significant historical underperformance relative to VOO. A long-term investment strategy in RTX would require careful consideration of its potential to outperform the broader market, given its historical underperformance relative to VOO and the risk associated with its cyclical nature within the aerospace and defense sector.  Further due diligence, including an in-depth analysis of the recent earnings jump and the drivers of financial metric variability, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
