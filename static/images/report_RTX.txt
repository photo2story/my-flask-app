**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR    | MDD     | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|-----------|---------|---------|--------|------|--------|
| 2016-2018 | 21.0%   | 72.6%   | -8.0%  | 0.9  | 89.8   |
| 2017-2019 | 37.0%   | 72.8%   | -5.0%  | 1.0  | 126.4  |

| 2019-2021 | 16.0%   | 81.5%   | -60.0% | 1.2  | 115.4  |
| 2020-2022 | 7.0%    | 81.5%   | -12.0% | 1.0  | 135.3  |

| 2022-2024 | 28.0%   | 79.2%   | -2.0%  | 0.6  | 155.2  |
| 2023-2025 | 84.0%   | 79.2%   | 16.0%  | 0.5  | 245.9  |

**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:** RTX has consistently shown negative alpha, indicating underperformance relative to its risk (Beta). This means that, over these periods, RTX hasn't delivered returns commensurate with the market risk it carries. The positive alpha in the last period (2023-2025) is a significant positive change.
*   **Beta:** Beta values generally hover around 1 or slightly above, suggesting RTX's price tends to move in tandem with the market, with a tendency to be slightly more volatile (especially in 2018-2021). The recent decrease in beta to 0.5 suggests that the correlation with the market is weakening.
*   **CAGR and MDD:** High maximum drawdowns (MDD) suggest significant price volatility and potential risk. The improved CAGR in the most recent period is a positive development.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 183.40
*   **Last Market Change:** -0.33
*   **5-day SMA:** 184.68
*   **20-day SMA:** 178.97
*   **60-day SMA:** 174.14

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 5-day SMA but above its 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This suggests a short-term pullback, but the longer-term trend remains upward.

**3) Indicators Analysis**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 67.74
*   **PPO:** 0.19
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (9 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0%

**Analysis:**

*   The high MRI suggests a favorable investment environment.
*   The RSI of 67.74 is approaching overbought territory (typically above 70), signaling the price may be due for a correction.
*   A PPO of 0.19 suggests that the current price is slightly above the moving average price, not an outstanding value.
*   The hybrid signal is a strong buy signal and the expected return of 0.0% is not persuasive.
*   Recent decline in relative divergence indicates underperformance compared to benchmark in the short term.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Mixed News:** Recent news headlines present a mixed picture. Some articles discuss RTX's surge to record highs and strong defense orders, while others point to underperformance relative to the broader market.
*   **Key Themes:** Backlogs, defense orders, analyst predictions, and market performance are recurring themes.

**Analysis:** The news suggests both positive catalysts (strong defense orders, backlogs) and potential concerns (underperformance, market volatility). It highlights the importance of careful analysis of RTX's specific situation rather than solely relying on market trends.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.86)
*   **Target Price:** Average 195.95 (Upside potential)
