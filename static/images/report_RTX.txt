## RTX Corp Stock Report

This report analyzes RTX Corporation, a leading aerospace and defense company.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

RTX's cumulative return of 36.75% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 82.57%.  The difference is -45.8%, placing it at the 40.1st percentile of its historical range of relative performance against the S&P 500 (ranging from -81.0% to 6.7%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market. While positive alpha values were observed in some periods (2015-2017, 2016-2018, 2017-2019), substantial negative alpha is noted in others (2018-2020, 2019-2021, 2020-2022).  Beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, generally increased over time until 2023-2025, before decreasing to 0.7 in 2022-2024 and to 0 in 2023-2025.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth throughout the period.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some variability in EPS and revenue.  There appears to be a duplicated entry for 2025-04-22.  A more complete picture requires analysis of quarterly trends and potentially comparing these figures to previous years' data.  Further investigation is needed to determine the significance of these fluctuations.

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출          |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-04-22 | 1.15 | 20.31 B$      |
| 2024-10-22 | 1.10 | 20.09 B$      |

**5. Financial Information:**

No key financial data (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) is available. This significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  Without this information, it is not possible to assess the company's profitability and overall financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX's performance significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, and the expected return is drastically negative against the S&P 500. The lack of key financial data hinders a complete assessment.  The inconsistency in Alpha/Beta and the negative expected return suggest that investors should proceed with caution.  Further investigation into the reasons for underperformance and a more complete financial dataset are crucial before making any investment decisions.
