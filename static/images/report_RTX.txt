## RTX Corp Stock Review

**0. Overview & Key Figures:**

RTX Corporation, a major aerospace and defense company, is experiencing a period of mixed performance.  Key figures are presented below, followed by a detailed analysis.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **RTX Cumulative Return:** 36.04%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 78.93%
* **Return Difference:** -42.9%  (This indicates RTX underperformed VOO significantly.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 43.4% (This means RTX's underperformance is near the 43.4th percentile of its historical underperformance relative to VOO, considering its maximum and minimum historical divergence.)


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta data reveal fluctuating performance relative to the market (Beta) and excess return (Alpha).  While some periods show positive Alpha (outperformance), others exhibit negative Alpha and a high Beta (implying high market sensitivity). The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows growth over time, but the fluctuating CAGR and high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) numbers illustrate substantial risk.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 32.0% | 56.7% | 0.0% | 0.1 | 90.1 |
| 2016-2018  | 22.0% | 64.0% | 1.0% | 0.5 | 76.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 37.0% | 64.0% | 3.0% | 1.0 | 110.5 |
| 2018-2020  | -24.0% | 64.0% | -54.0% | 1.2 | 86.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 15.0% | 61.4% | -46.0% | 1.4 | 106.3 |
| 2020-2022  | -13.0% | 69.5% | -22.0% | 1.4 | 127.6 |
| 2021-2023  | 2.0% | 69.5% | -19.0% | 1.1 | 109.2 |
| 2022-2024  | -1.0% | 69.9% | -22.0% | 0.7 | 153.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 7.0% | 69.9% | -0.1 | -0.1 | 160.6 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $120.28
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $123.66
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $127.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $128.19

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price increase of $5.74 compared to the previous close may indicate a temporary rebound from a downward trend.  Further observation is needed to confirm this.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.97 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.7554 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -10.1% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, >2 years):** -56.0% (Significantly lower than the S&P 500)  This is a very significant negative expected return and needs further investigation to understand its basis.

The recent price jump signals a notable event, but the combination of low RSI, negative PPO, and negative expected return suggests caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some inconsistency. While revenue has generally increased, EPS shows volatility.  A more detailed analysis would be needed to understand the drivers of this inconsistency.  The repetition of the 2025-04-22 entry in the table is an error and needs clarification.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2025-04-22 | 1.15 | $20.31B      |
| 2024-10-22 | 1.10 | $20.09B      |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08 | $19.72B      |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29 | $19.30B      |
| 2025-04-22 | 1.29 | $19.30B      | *(Duplicate Entry - needs correction)*


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability and Capital and Profitability tables show mixed results. While revenue mostly increased, Profit Margin and ROE numbers fluctuate significantly.  The low ROE in Q2 2024 requires further investigation to determine the cause.


Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $20.31B | 20.27% |
| 2024-12-31 | $21.62B | 19.59% |
| 2024-09-30 | $20.09B | 20.08% |
| 2024-06-30 | $19.72B | 18.15% |
| 2024-03-31 | $19.30B | 18.45% |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2025-03-31 | $61.52B | 2.50% |
| 2024-12-31 | $60.16B | 2.46% |
| 2024-09-30 | $61.11B | 2.41% |
| 2024-06-30 | $58.98B | 0.19% |
| 2024-03-31 | $60.48B | 2.83% |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX shows a mixed performance picture. While revenue is generally increasing,  profitability and returns are volatile.  The significant underperformance against the S&P 500 and the negative long-term expected return (-56%) raise serious concerns.  The high MDD values highlight substantial risk.  Before any investment decision, a thorough investigation is necessary to understand the drivers behind the inconsistent earnings, the low expected return, and the high volatility.  Clarification on the duplicated data entry and the basis for the -56% expected return is crucial.  Considering the current market conditions and the information available, a cautious approach is advised.
