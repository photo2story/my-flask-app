| 2023-2025  | 28.0%  | 79.2%  | -37.0%  | 0.3    | 229.4  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuating.  Positive in some periods, negative in others, indicating inconsistent growth.
*   **MDD:** Consistently high Maximum Drawdown values (67-80%), representing significant peak-to-trough declines.  This indicates substantial risk and volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative Alpha values across all periods. This means RTX has underperformed relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark (likely the S&P 500).
*   **Beta:** Beta values have fluctuated around 0 and up to 1.4, suggesting RTX's volatility is generally similar to or slightly higher than the market in some periods (Beta=1). A Beta of 1.4 during 2020-2022 indicates higher volatility than the market during that period. A Beta of -0.1 during 2017-2019 indicates lower volatility than the market during that period.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization generally increased.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 168.45
*   **Last Market Data:** Price: 171.1, Previous Close: 171.31, Change: -0.12
*   **5-day SMA:** 170.56
*   **20-day SMA:** 173.81
*   **60-day SMA:** 168.36

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day SMAs, suggesting a short-term downward trend. The 60-day SMA is very close to the current price, implying it might act as a support level. The minor change in the last market data doesn't indicate significant volatility at the moment.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 32.57
*   **PPO:** -0.64
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-11-03)
*   **Recent Divergence Change (20 days):** -8.4 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -525.4%

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium investment risk, but the Hybrid Signal suggests to "Buy 100% of cash", seemingly contradictory information.
*   The RSI of 32.57 indicates that the stock is nearing oversold conditions, potentially suggesting a possible rebound.
*   The negative PPO indicates a downtrend.
*   The negative change in relative divergence over the last 20 days confirms the short-term downward trend.
*   The extremely negative Expected Return warrants significant caution. The model predicts considerable underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if investing long-term from this point.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Shares Sold by Trek Financial LLC:** (Bearish Signal) This suggests institutional investors might be reducing their position.
*   **Stock Prediction by 2027:** (Mixed Signal) Need to read the article for specific predictions (bullish or bearish).
*   **Stock Down 3% Today:** (Bearish Signal) Indicates recent selling pressure.
*   **$1.6 Billion Sustainment Contract:** (Bullish Signal) A significant contract win is generally positive.
*   **Buy Thesis Reinforced:** (Bullish Signal) An analyst opinion supporting a buy thesis.  Important to understand the reasoning behind the thesis (structural demand, margin expansion).
*   **Investor Focus:** (Neutral Signal)  Indicates increased attention, but doesn't inherently indicate a positive or negative outlook.

**Analysis:** The news is mixed, with both positive and negative signals. The recent contract and reinforced buy thesis are positive, but the share sale and stock price decline are concerning.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (1.90)
*   **Target Price:** 193.79 (avg), 217.00 (high), 150.00 (low)

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a "Buy" rating with a target price significantly higher than the current price. However, the low target price of $150.00 suggests some analysts are less optimistic.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. While recent earnings and revenue figures are positive, indicating improving financial performance, concerns exist due to high historical drawdowns, negative Alpha, a recent share sale by Trek Financial LLC, and the extremely negative Expected Return predicted by the model. Analyst opinions are mixed, with a consensus "Buy" rating but a wide range of target prices. The short-term trend is downward, as indicated by the moving averages and change in relative divergence. The RSI nearing oversold territory may indicate a potential bounce, but it is not a guarantee.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, a cautious approach is warranted. The stock shows some positive financial trends, but significant concerns exist regarding its historical performance, short-term trends, and future underperformance predictions. Further research is recommended before making any investment decisions, with careful consideration given to the potential risks and the factors contributing to the negative Expected Return. A medium investment is recommended due to Market Risk Indicator (MRI) = 0.8.
