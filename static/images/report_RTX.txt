Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of RTX Corp based on the provided data.

**1. Return Rate Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis**

*   **RTX Corp Overview:** RTX Corp is an aerospace and defense company that provides advanced technology and services to the aviation and defense industries.

*   **Return Rate Comparison:**
    *   RTX Cumulative Return: 34.21%
    *   S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return: 99.09%
    *   Divergence: -64.4 (Relative Divergence: 15.7)

*   **Analysis:** RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. The large negative divergence (-64.4) indicates that RTX's returns have lagged considerably.

*   **Analysis of Alpha/Beta:**
    *   **Alpha:**  The consistently negative Alpha values across most periods indicate that RTX has generally underperformed relative to what would be expected based on its beta (market sensitivity).  While 2015-2017 show 0% alpha, most other periods display negative alpha, meaning RTX is not generating excess returns relative to its risk.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values fluctuate, indicating varying degrees of correlation with the market. Beta values closer to 1 mean that the stock's price tends to move with the market. Beta > 1 suggests higher volatility than the market, while Beta < 1 indicates lower volatility. Note that some periods (2017-2019) actually display negative beta.
    *   **CAGR:** The inconsistent CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) highlights the volatile nature of RTX's returns.
    *   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is relatively high, indicating a higher risk and large potential losses.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   Close Price: 178.29
*   Last-market: {'price': 178.29, 'previousClose': 177.2, 'change': 0.62}
*   5-day SMA: 179.238
*   20-day SMA: 173.7087
*   60-day SMA: 171.5292

*   **Analysis:** The current price is below the 5-day SMA but above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs.  This suggests a recent upward trend, but potentially a slight pullback in the very short term. The market data {'price': 178.29, 'previousClose': 177.2, 'change': 0.62} signifies a slight positive change from the previous close.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Hybrid Signal Analysis**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.7 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 56.15
*   PPO: 0.39
*   Hybrid Signal: Buy 100% (10 shares) - Very Safe - MRI:0.90 (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-11)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change: 8.6 (+) - Short-term Rise
*   Expected Return (%): -274.9

*   **Analysis:**
    *   **MRI:** A medium MRI suggests that investing in RTX carries moderate risk.
    *   **RSI:** An RSI of 56.15 is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   **PPO:**  A PPO of 0.39 suggests a slightly positive momentum.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** Despite the negative expected return, the system recommends a 100% investment with a low cash ratio, classifying it as "Very Safe" with an MRI of 0.90. This seems contradictory and should be examined further. It may be a short-term recommendation.
    *   **Relative Divergence Change:** An increase of 8.6 in relative divergence indicates recent short-term gains.
    *   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-274.9%) is concerning and suggests the model predicts significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon. This warrants deep investigation.

*   **Headlines:**
    *   RTX Stock Soars to Fresh Highs (Dec 15, 2025)

The "Defense Orders Explode" headline is significant, as defense spending and contracts can significantly impact RTX's revenue. The article that covers analyst's expectation for RTX's future price by 2027 would also be worth reading.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   Consensus: Buy (1.86 on a 1-5 scale)
*   Opinions: 20
*   Target Price: Average $195.70, High $219.00, Low $150.00

*   **Analysis:**  Analysts generally have a positive outlook on RTX, with a "Buy" consensus and an average target price significantly higher than the current price. However, the low target price of $150.00 suggests that some analysts are less optimistic. It is crucial to understand the rationale behind the target prices to form a balanced view.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Underperformance Relative to S&P 500:** RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, but the relative divergence indicates current underperformance is near its historical low.
*   **Positive Recent Developments:**  Positive recent news (record highs, defense order surge), rising EPS/Revenue, and increasing ROE suggest a potentially improving outlook for RTX.
*   **Analyst Optimism:**  Analysts have a "Buy" consensus with a significant upside target price.
*   **Conflicting Signals:**  The Hybrid Signal recommending a full investment contrasts sharply with the extremely negative expected return.  This discrepancy needs further investigation.  The short-term rise in relative divergence suggests recent positive momentum.
*   **Key Considerations:** The negative Alpha values highlight that RTX has not historically provided risk-adjusted excess returns. The high maximum drawdown implies significant risk. The analyst expectations seem overly positive, given the past underperformance.

*   **Conclusion:** While RTX shows some promising recent developments, especially in its earnings and analyst outlook, the long-term underperformance relative to the market and the extremely negative expected return from one of the indicators should give potential investors pause. Further investigation is needed to reconcile the conflicting signals and fully understand the risks and potential rewards of investing in RTX. The recent surge to record highs might be a good sign, but it's crucial to consider whether this is sustainable. It would be important to understand *why* the expected return is so significantly negative before making an investment decision.
