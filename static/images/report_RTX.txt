## RTX Corp (RTX) Stock Report

This report analyzes RTX Corp (RTX), a leading aerospace and defense company, based on the provided data.  Note that this analysis is limited to the provided information and may not be comprehensive.  Independent research is recommended before making any investment decisions.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

RTX's cumulative return (67.57%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (113.65%). The provided data shows a -46.1% divergence from the S&P 500, placing it at the 28.3rd percentile of its historical range of divergence (-66.2% to 4.8%).  This suggests underperformance relative to the broader market.  The Alpha consistently near zero across multiple years indicates the stock's return largely mirrors the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $116.01
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $116.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $116.8375
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $120.43

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (46.06):**  Indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.
* **PPO (0.05):** A slightly positive PPO suggests some upward momentum, although weak.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (+7.5):** Shows a short-term increase in relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-71.4%):**  This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a significant concern and requires further investigation to understand its basis.  It strongly suggests the model predicting this outcome believes RTX will considerably underperform the market.  The $116.01 price isn't explicitly flagged as indicating a significant price movement (e.g., a sharp jump or drop), but it is crucial to consider this projection's implications.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals significant volatility:

* **Revenue:** Shows fluctuating growth, with a notable drop in Q3 2023, followed by a rebound.
* **EPS:** Highly volatile, with significant swings between positive and negative earnings.  There is no consistency in quarterly EPS performance.
* **Comparison:**  There's no clear trend;  positive and negative surprises are present, indicating substantial unpredictability in earnings.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, though there's a large drop in Q3 2023. Profit margins are generally high, except for a significant drop in Q3 2023.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows fluctuation, and ROE is volatile, reflecting the instability in profitability.  Again, the Q3 2023 figures are particularly weak.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last 2 days) is provided.  Therefore, no analysis of recent market outlook, analyst opinions, or performance highlights can be offered based on the provided data.  This is a significant gap in the analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

RTX's performance is currently underwhelming compared to the S&P 500.  While recent revenue shows recovery from a Q3 2023 slump, EPS remains unstable.  Technical indicators offer a mixed picture, and the extremely negative long-term expected return raises serious concerns.  The lack of recent news and detailed information about the basis of the -71.4% expected return significantly limits a thorough evaluation.  Further research into the reasons behind the Q3 2023 earnings downturn and the rationale for the negative expected return are absolutely necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high volatility in both earnings and financial metrics highlight a company with considerable risk.
