**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $132.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $132.96
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $131.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $126.74

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downtrend.  However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a generally positive longer-term trend.  The recent price change of $0.31 represents a modest increase.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Low to Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 63.13 (Slightly above neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.19 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +0.7 (Positive, suggesting recent short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -8.3% (This implies underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a 2+ year horizon.)

The combination of a slightly elevated RSI, negative PPO, and positive relative strength change suggests a potentially mixed short-term outlook. The negative expected return is a significant consideration for long-term investment decisions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1    | $20.09 B      |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08   | $19.72 B      |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29   | $19.30 B      |
| 2023-10-24 | -0.68  | $13.46 B      |
| 2024-10-22 | -0.68  | $13.46 B      |

There's an apparent error in the data with duplicate entries for October 22nd, 2024 and 2023.  Ignoring the duplicates, revenue shows a generally upward trend, but EPS is volatile, showing both strong and weak performance across the quarters.  Further investigation into the cause of the EPS volatility is necessary.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $21.62B | 19.59% |
| 2024-09-30 | $20.09B | 20.08% |
| 2024-06-30 | $19.72B | 18.15% |
| 2024-03-31 | $19.30B | 18.45% |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.93B | 20.12% |

Revenue is steadily increasing, while profit margins show some fluctuation but remain consistently high.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $60.16B | 2.46% |
| 2024-09-30 | $61.11B | 2.41% |
| 2024-06-30 | $58.98B | 0.19% |
| 2024-03-31 | $60.48B | 2.83% |
| 2023-12-31 | $59.80B | 2.38% |


Equity fluctuates, and ROE shows significant variability, particularly the low ROE in Q2 2024 warrants further investigation.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows a generally positive long-term trend, with increasing revenue and healthy profit margins. However, EPS volatility and the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns.  The recent price action indicates short-term uncertainty.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the EPS fluctuations and the lower-than-expected long-term return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Further analysis of the duplicated data points in the earnings report is also necessary to ensure data accuracy.  The relatively low Beta suggests less market sensitivity than the broader market, but the significant volatility in Alpha indicates a high degree of idiosyncratic risk.
