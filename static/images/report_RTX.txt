The recent price drop (-3.83) is noteworthy and may suggest a need for further investigation into the underlying cause for the downward movement. While there's no immediate evidence of a sharp drop or surge, continued monitoring of market developments is crucial.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  While Q1 2024 and Q3 2024 show significant EPS, Q2 2024 shows a very low EPS.  The negative EPS in late 2023 needs further investigation to understand the cause.  Revenue shows a generally increasing trend, though it appears to have slightly plateaued in recent quarters.  More context (e.g., industry comparisons) would be needed to fully assess the significance of the revenue changes.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows a mixed performance picture. While long-term CAGR is generally positive and recent earnings show strong revenue, the recent price drop and underperformance against the S&P 500 raise concerns.  The significant volatility in EPS and ROE also requires further scrutiny.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of these fluctuations, including a review of the company's strategic initiatives, industry trends, and potential risks.  The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500, especially considering the recent price drop, indicates a cautious outlook for the short-term. However, long-term potential could still exist if the company successfully navigates current challenges and benefits from sector-specific tailwinds.  A more detailed fundamental analysis, including an examination of the companyâ€™s competitive landscape, management, and debt levels, would provide a more complete evaluation.
