**RTX Corp Overview:** RTX Corp. is an aerospace and defense company providing advanced systems and services for commercial, military, and government customers worldwide.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **Cumulative Return (RTX):** 36.17%
*   **Cumulative Return (VOO - S&P 500):** 91.40%

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD      | Alpha  | Beta  | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| 2016-2018  | -7.0%   | 97.9%    | -10.0% | 0.9   | 89.8   |
| 2017-2019  | 7.0%    | 97.9%    | -10.0% | 1.0   | 126.4  |
| 2018-2020  | -25.0%  | 100.0%   | -46.0% | 1.2   | 95.9   |
| 2019-2021  | 11.0%   | 99.9%    | -32.0% | 1.2   | 115.4  |
| 2020-2022  | -19.0%  | 100.0%   | -17.0% | 1.0   | 135.3  |
| 2021-2023  | -17.0%  | 100.0%   | -18.0% | 0.7   | 112.8  |
| 2022-2024  | -12.0%  | 100.0%   | -32.0% | 0.6   | 155.2  |
| 2023-2025  | 39.0%   | 95.3%    | -23.0% | 0.5   | 245.9  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  The Compound Annual Growth Rate fluctuates significantly, with negative values in many periods. The recent increase (39% for 2023-2025) is a positive sign, but needs to be sustained.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently very high, suggesting significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** The negative Alpha indicates underperformance relative to its benchmark after adjusting for risk (Beta). This is consistent with the lower cumulative return.
*   **Beta:** Beta is generally below 1.0 in more recent periods (0.5-0.7), implying less volatility than the market (S&P 500). This, combined with negative Alpha, suggests RTX is not capturing market upside while still experiencing significant drawdowns.
*   **Market Cap:** The Market Cap shows a general upward trend indicating growth in size of the company.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 183.40
*   **Last Market Data:** Price 183.40, Previous Close 184.01, Change -0.33
*   **5-day SMA:** 184.68
*   **20-day SMA:** 178.97
*   **60-day SMA:** 174.14

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below the 5-day SMA, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it's above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, indicating a longer-term upward trend. The small negative change from the previous close isn't a major concern on its own.

**3) RSI, PPO and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 67.74 (Approaching overbought territory but not there yet).
*   **PPO:** 0.19 (Slightly positive)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (9 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 0.0 (-): 단기하락 (Short-term decrease)
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0% (No excess return expected compared to S&P 500).

**Analysis:**

*   The Market Risk Indicator suggests that the market considers RTX a solid/recommended investment.
*   The RSI indicates that the stock might be approaching overbought conditions, suggesting a potential pullback.
*   The PPO is slightly positive, indicating a modest upward trend in momentum.
*   The hybrid signal suggests a full investment is warranted based on the model's parameters.
*   However, the key concern is the zero expected excess return compared to the S&P 500. This reinforces the earlier point about underperformance.
*   Recent short term decrease.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Mixed Headlines:** The news headlines present a mixed picture. Some articles discuss RTX reaching record highs due to defense orders ("RTX Surges to Record Highs"), while others question if investors are missing out ("Are RTX Stock Investors Happy?"). There are also articles analyzing the stock's setup ("RTX stock sets up Monday").
*   **Key Themes:** Defense orders seem to be a significant driver. Some are analyzing the company's backlogs and demand ("RTX: Record Backlogs And Structural Demand Signal Upside").

**Analysis:** The recent news highlights the company's reliance on defense orders. While record backlogs are positive, the mixed sentiment in the headlines suggests some uncertainty about RTX's future performance and ability to deliver value compared to broader market indices.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 1.86)
*   **Target Price:** Average: 195.95, High: 219.00, Low: 150.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not Available

**Analysis:**  The analyst consensus is positive, with a "Buy" rating and a target price significantly above the current price. This suggests analysts believe the stock is undervalued and has potential for growth. However, this optimism needs to be balanced with the other data points.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출       |
|------------|-------|------------|
| 2025-10-21 | 1.43  | 22.48 B$   |

| 2025-10-21 | 1.10  | 20.09 B$   |

**Analysis:**  Both EPS and Revenue show a generally positive trend over the past few quarters, especially when the duplicated value is taken out. This indicates improving profitability and top-line growth, which are positive signs. Note: The last earnings report appears to have duplicate entries - it should only be present once.

| 2024-09-30 | $61.11B | 2.41% |

**Analysis:** Revenue, profit margin, Equity, and ROE are all trending upwards, indicating significant growth and increased performance.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

RTX Corp presents a mixed picture. While recent earnings, revenue, profit margin, equity, and ROE all show growth, and analysts have a "Buy" rating with a target price significantly above the current price, it is still underperforming the broader market. This underperformance is reflected in the large negative divergence of the return rate compared to the S&P 500, the negative Alpha in the Alpha/Beta analysis, and the zero expected excess return. The high maximum drawdowns highlight the stock's volatility.

The company's reliance on defense orders, as indicated by the news headlines, makes it susceptible to geopolitical events and government spending policies. The positive momentum as indicated by the PPO must also be contrasted with a RSI close to overbought levels which could indicate a short-term pullback.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the current data, investing in RTX Corp. carries risks. While analysts are optimistic and recent financial performance is improving, the stock has historically underperformed the market and is expected to continue doing so, despite the high market risk indicator. A potential investor should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment goals before investing. The high market risk indicator suggests the company is fundamentally strong and worthy of investment, and so further due diligence is required before investing in this company.
