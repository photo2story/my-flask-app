**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* Closing Price: $125.43
* 5-Day Moving Average: $124.60
* 20-Day Moving Average: $126.80
* 60-Day Moving Average: $121.11

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting potential for further price correction. However, it's above the 5-day and 60-day averages, indicating some short-term support.  The recent price increase of $1.74 (from the previous close) could be a sign of a short-term uptrend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* RSI: 37.98 (Slightly below 40, suggesting the stock might be oversold, but not a strong buy signal)
* PPO: -0.56 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change: +12.6% (Suggests a short-term upward trend.)

The relatively low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the recent price jump, create a mixed signal. The positive divergence suggests potential for continued short-term upside, but the overall technical picture is not strongly bullish.  The price change of $1.74 is notable, indicating some potential short-term upward momentum, but not necessarily a significant trend reversal.  The expected return of -38.8% over a long-term period is alarming and needs further investigation. It suggests that the projection is significantly underperforming even with long-term (2+ years) investment.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1    | $20.09 B       |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08   | $19.72 B       |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29   | $19.30 B       |
| 2023-10-24 | -0.68  | $13.46 B       |
| 2024-10-22 | -0.68  | $13.46 B       | *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*


Earnings show significant volatility.  Revenue is relatively consistent, but EPS fluctuates dramatically.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.  A more thorough analysis requires examination of the underlying causes of these earnings swings.


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue and Profitability:

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $21.62B    | 19.59%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $20.09B    | 20.08%        |

| 2024-03-31 | $19.30B    | 18.45%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.93B    | 20.12%        |

Capital and Profitability:

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE           |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $60.16B    | 2.46%         |
| 2024-09-30 | $61.11B    | 2.41%         |
| 2024-06-30 | $58.98B    | 0.19%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $60.48B    | 2.83%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $59.80B    | 2.38%         |

Revenue is relatively stable and shows consistent profitability.  However, ROE is quite volatile, potentially indicating underlying financial instability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX has underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period, but the underperformance is not extreme in its historical context.  Recent price action shows some short-term strength, but technical indicators present a mixed signal.  Earnings demonstrate significant volatility, requiring further investigation into the underlying drivers.  The financial statements highlight generally stable revenue but fluctuating profitability and ROE.  The negative long-term expected return (-38.8%) is a serious concern.  Further analysis is needed to determine the validity of this projection and the underlying reasons for RTX's underperformance relative to the market.  A deeper dive into the company's specific business segments, competitive landscape, and future outlook is essential for a complete investment assessment.
