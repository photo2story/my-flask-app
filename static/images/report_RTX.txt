**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date | EPS | Revenue |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08 | 19.72 B$ |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29 | 19.30 B$ |

The most recent earnings report (2024-07-25) shows a significant decline in EPS and revenue compared to the previous quarter. The company missed analysts' expectations for both metrics.

**5. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp is currently experiencing a period of underperformance compared to the broader market. The stock price is showing signs of short-term weakness, but the long-term trend appears to be upward. The recent earnings report was disappointing, but the company's position in a strong industry could offer growth potential in the future.

**6. Investment Recommendation:**

Considering the mixed signals from the current data, a cautious approach is recommended. While the expected return suggests potential for long-term growth, the recent underperformance and weak earnings warrant further analysis before making any investment decisions. It is crucial to monitor RTX's future earnings reports and industry trends closely to assess its potential for a turnaround.
