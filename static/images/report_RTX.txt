| 2023-2025  | 12.0% | 80.0% | 1.1 | 1.1 | 171.2 |

The alpha values fluctuate significantly, indicating inconsistent outperformance relative to the market.  Beta values generally suggest moderate market sensitivity, although this fluctuates as well.


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $128.26
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $124.31
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $130.22
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $127.99

The price is slightly below the 20-day moving average, suggesting potential short-term downside pressure, but above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages.  The recent price increase (Last-market data shows a positive 'change') indicates a potential short-term reversal or consolidation.


**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.47 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.03 (Slightly below oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.52 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -9.3% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return:** -39.8% (Significant negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term)

The indicators suggest a bearish outlook.  The high MRI and negative PPO signal caution.  The relatively low RSI indicates potential for a short-term bounce, but the negative divergence further strengthens the bearish sentiment. The large recent price change (0.94)  could signify a short-term upward bounce, and should be carefully monitored.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue      |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1    | $20.09 B     |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08   | $19.72 B     |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29   | $19.30 B     |
| 2023-10-24 | -0.68  | $13.46 B     |
| 2024-10-22 | -0.68  | $13.46 B     |  *(Duplicate entry, likely an error)*

Earnings are inconsistent.  While revenue generally increased, EPS fluctuates significantly. The significant negative EPS in Q4 2023 is a major concern.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.

|---------|-------------|--------|

| 2024-09-30 | $61.11B    | 2.41%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $58.98B    | 0.19%  |

| 2023-12-31 | $59.80B    | 2.38%  |

Equity fluctuates, and ROE shows some variability.  The low ROE in Q2 2024 is noteworthy.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

RTX's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly. While revenue growth shows a positive trend, inconsistent earnings, fluctuating profit margins, and a high market risk indicator signal caution.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, although the recent price increase could indicate a short-term bounce. The -39.8% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is a major negative.  Further investigation into the causes of the inconsistent earnings and the duplicate earnings data entry is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The current data suggests RTX carries significant risk and further due diligence is strongly recommended before considering any investment.
