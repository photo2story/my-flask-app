RTX Corp (RTX) is a leading aerospace and defense company.  The cumulative return of RTX is 74.97%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 116.43%.  This represents a difference of -41.5%.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows inconsistent performance relative to the market (Beta near 0 suggests low correlation with the market) with periods of strong outperformance and significant underperformance.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values in several periods highlight the risk associated with the stock.

* **Closing Price:** $120.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $118.38
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $116.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $119.07

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 63.61 (Slightly above the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.57 (Positive value indicates bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +8.0% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -52.8% (This implies a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term.  This should be treated with caution, as long-term projections are inherently uncertain.)

The current price of $120.51 does not appear to reflect a significant recent price surge or crash, given the relatively small deviations from the moving averages.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

RTX has shown significant volatility in its performance relative to the S&P 500.

Earnings show some volatility, with a significant downturn in Q4 2023.  Financial statements reveal strong revenue growth except for a dip in Q3 2023, impacting profit margins and ROE.  The substantial negative expected return should be carefully considered, alongside the potential for future outperformance based on the historical analysis showing periods of high CAGR.  Further investigation into the Q3 2023 downturn is crucial for a complete assessment.  A deeper dive into the company's strategy and future prospects is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The high MDD values in the historical data also indicate significant risk.
