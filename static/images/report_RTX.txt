**7. 종합 Analysis:**

RTX는 최근 계약 체결과 매출 성장을 보이며 긍정적인 신호를 보이고 있지만, 전반적으로 S&P 500에 비해 저조한 성과를 나타내고 있습니다. Analyst 컨센서스는 '매수'이지만, 목표 주가는 현재 주가와 비슷합니다. RSI는 과매수 상태를 나타내며, 장기 기대 수익률은 부정적입니다. 최근 수익 보고서와 재무 데이터는 매출 증가와 안정적인 수익성을 보여주지만, ROE는 상대적으로 낮습니다.

**Summary:**

RTX presents a mixed picture. While recent news, earnings, and analyst ratings suggest some positive momentum, the historical underperformance against the S&P 500, high volatility, overbought RSI, and negative long-term expected return raise concerns. Potential investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment horizon.
