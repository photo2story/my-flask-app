**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

RTX Corp (RTX) is an aerospace and defense company.  Its cumulative return of 79.17% significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 127.58%. The difference is -48.41%, placing it at the 30.38th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on provided min/max data.  This indicates underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance relative to the market (S&P 500) across different periods.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others show negative alpha and a beta generally around 1, indicating some level of market correlation but varying degrees of volatility and market-beating potential.  Note that CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is also volatile across years.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates moderately.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) shows some periods with substantial drawdowns, suggesting the stock carries significant risk.

* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -14.93 (Indicates a recent weakening in relative performance against the benchmark)
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 0.0% (This indicates that no significant long-term outperformance is expected versus the S&P 500 based on the provided data).  Note that this is a *stated* expectation and should not be interpreted as a forecast of future performance.  Additional analysis is needed to assess long-term return expectations.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows volatile EPS and revenue.  There's a significant drop in revenue and a negative EPS in Q3 2023, followed by improved performance in subsequent quarters.  The latest earnings report (2024-10-22) shows a positive EPS and high revenue.  However, without access to analyst expectations, a precise assessment of whether this exceeded expectations cannot be made.  More data points would allow for a more detailed analysis of the trend in profitability.

**5. Financial Information:**

The provided financial data (Revenue & Profitability, Capital & Profitability) highlights fluctuations in revenue, profit margins, and ROE (Return on Equity) across quarters.  While Q4 2023 showed a significant dip, subsequent quarters indicate a recovery in profitability.  The variability in ROE suggests that profitability fluctuates, making consistent investment returns less predictable.
