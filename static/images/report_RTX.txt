**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows a mixed performance picture.  While revenue and profitability appear healthy, recent stock performance has lagged behind the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest potential risks, and the projected long-term return is significantly below the market benchmark.  The inconsistency in alpha and beta suggests the stock's performance is not consistently correlated with the market. A more in-depth analysis, including examination of the company's strategic direction, industry trends, and macroeconomic factors, would be necessary to make a well-informed investment decision.  The data provided shows some inconsistencies (duplicate earnings data entry) and lack of some crucial context that may affect the conclusions made.  The provided relative divergence should also be approached with care as the maximum and minimum values were only given without sufficient historical context.
