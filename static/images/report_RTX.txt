**7. 종합적인 분석:**

*   **Underperformance:** RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and this underperformance is historically significant.
*   **Volatility:** High Maximum Drawdown values suggest significant volatility and risk.

*   **News Impact:** The stock is being pulled in both directions by positive (contracts, engine testing) and negative (cyberattack) news.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Varied analyst target prices reflect uncertainty.
*   **Earnings & Financials:** Revenue is growing, but profit margins and ROE are concerns, especially the dip in Q2 2024. The long term Expected return is very negative.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Given the underperformance, volatility, negative alpha, cyberattack concerns, and low ROE, a cautious approach is warranted. The negative Expected Return (%) is a major red flag. Investors should carefully consider the risks before investing in RTX. Close monitoring of the situation is advised, paying particular attention to developments related to the cyberattack and any improvements in profitability and ROE.
