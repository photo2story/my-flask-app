* **Closing Price:** $128.89

* **Change:** -$0.28 (a slight decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $128.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $129.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $128.43

The price is slightly below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, but above the 60-day moving average.  This suggests some short-term downward pressure, but a longer-term upward trend is potentially in place.

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.9 (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -36.3% (This is a very large negative return.  Additional context about the calculation methodology is necessary for interpretation.)


The slight price decrease is not significant enough to suggest a sharp decline. The technical indicators paint a mixed picture, with some suggesting potential for upward movement.  The extremely negative expected return warrants further investigation.

More comprehensive financial analysis, considering factors beyond the data provided, is necessary for a complete assessment of the investment opportunity.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the significant fluctuations in earnings and ROE is crucial before forming a conclusive opinion.
