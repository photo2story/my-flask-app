**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **5-day SMA:** 184.85
*   **20-day SMA:** 179.91
*   **60-day SMA:** 174.44

**Analysis:**

The stock price is currently trading above all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). This *generally* suggests an upward trend in the short, medium, and long term. The recent slight increase in the last market also points towards upward momentum.

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 69.19 (Approaching Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.2186
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (5 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2026-01-02)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 3.7 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Price Change:** {'price': 188.26, 'previousClose': 187.25, 'change': 0.54}
*   **Expected Return (%):** -156.9% (Long-term)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk, indicating a relatively stable market environment for this stock.
*   The RSI is approaching the overbought territory (typically above 70), suggesting the stock might be due for a pullback or consolidation.
*   PPO is a momentum indicator, with a positive value suggesting an upward trend.
*   The hybrid signal recommends buying 90% of the available cash, highlighting a bullish sentiment, but at a smaller allocation of 5 shares - Safe.
*   The recent increase in relative divergence supports the short-term upward movement.
*   **Crucially, the Expected Return of -156.9% is highly concerning.** This projects significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 if held long-term from this point. This strongly contradicts the buy signal and requires deeper investigation. This could be the result of a model error or an extremely pessimistic outlook embedded in the calculations.
