**6.  Comprehensive Analysis:**

RTX Corp has shown periods of strong performance but also significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, especially in the long-term projections.

The technical indicators offer a mixed signal.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the volatile EPS and the significant negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  Careful consideration should be given to the risk involved.  Further investigation into the duplicate entry in the earnings data is necessary for accurate analysis.
