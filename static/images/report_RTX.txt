**6) Overall Analysis:**

RTX has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the analyzed period. While some short-term indicators (RSI nearing oversold levels) might suggest potential buying opportunities, the long-term outlook is bearish, with a projected significant underperformance against the benchmark.  The volatile earnings data and lack of crucial financial information highlight the need for further investigation before making any investment decisions.  The substantial negative alpha in several periods raises serious concerns.  Addressing the data inconsistencies and obtaining complete financial statements is crucial for a more comprehensive and reliable assessment.
