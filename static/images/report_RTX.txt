**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $128.78
* **Last Market Price:** $128.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $129.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $124.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $120.19

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downward trend.  However, it is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potentially positive longer-term trend.  The recent price change shows a small decrease.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 67.41 (Slightly above the neutral 50, suggesting the stock is not overbought but approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.29 (Positive, indicating a bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.8 (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500, long-term):** -35.6% (This suggests a potential long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500.)

The technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the PPO suggests bullish momentum, the RSI is nearing overbought levels and the recent relative divergence indicates a short-term downward trend.  The negative expected return is a significant concern for long-term investors.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1   | $20.09 B       |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08  | $19.72 B       |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29  | $19.30 B       |
| 2023-10-24 | -0.68 | $13.46 B       |
| 2024-10-22 | -0.68 | $13.46 B       |

There's a duplicate entry for October 22, 2024.  Revenue shows a generally upward trend, but EPS is volatile, with significant swings between quarters.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind these fluctuations.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $21.62B    | 19.59%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $20.09B    | 20.08%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $19.72B    | 18.15%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $19.30B    | 18.45%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.93B    | 20.12%        |

Revenue shows growth, and profit margins are generally healthy, though some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation is evident.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE     |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $60.16B    | 2.46%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $61.11B    | 2.41%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $58.98B    | 0.19%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $60.48B    | 2.83%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $59.80B    | 2.38%   |

Equity fluctuates, and ROE shows variability, with a notably low value in Q2 2024.  This requires further analysis to determine the underlying cause.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX demonstrates strong revenue growth and generally healthy profit margins. However, its stock performance significantly lags the S&P 500, as indicated by a negative alpha and lower cumulative returns.  While recent price action shows some positive signs, technical indicators are mixed.  The volatile EPS and fluctuating ROE raise concerns.  Long-term investors should carefully weigh the company's growth potential against its consistent underperformance relative to the broader market and the significant negative expected return compared to the S&P 500.  Further due diligence, including a deeper examination of the causes for the EPS and ROE volatility, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
