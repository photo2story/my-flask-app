2025-12-19 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down the analysis of RTX Corp. based on the provided data.

**0) Overview**

RTX Corp is a leading aerospace and defense company.

**1) Return Analysis**

*   **Cumulative Return:** RTX: 34.21%, VOO: 99.09%
*   **Divergence:** -64.4 (Relative Divergence: 15.7)

**Analysis:** RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period.  The large negative divergence indicates a considerable performance gap. The relative divergence of 15.7 suggests that, while the divergence is large, it's relatively near the minimum observed difference between the two. This means the underperformance, while significant, is near the better end of the range of its divergence from the S&P 500 historically.

*   **CAGR:** Varies significantly, from -25% to 35%. This indicates volatility in RTX's returns over different periods.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdowns (around 70-80%) suggest significant potential for losses during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark after adjusting for risk.
*   **Beta:** Fluctuates, but generally close to or above 1 (except in the 2017-2019 period), suggesting RTX's price tends to move more than the market as a whole. The increased Beta may point to correlation with market upswings but higher sensitivity to downward fluctuations.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization tends to grow, but as seen in other elements, it's erratic.

*   **Current Close:** 178.29
*   **5-day SMA:** 179.238
*   **20-day SMA:** 173.7087
*   **60-day SMA:** 171.5292

**Analysis:** The stock is currently trading below its 5-day SMA but above its 20-day and 60-day SMAs.  This suggests a possible short-term pullback after a recent upward trend. The last market data shows a price of 178.29, an increase from the previous close of 177.2 with a change of 0.62.

**3) Indicators**

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 8.6 (+): 단기상승 (short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -274.9

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** A medium investment recommendation suggests a moderate level of risk and potential reward.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 56.15 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A slightly positive PPO suggests a modest upward trend in the stock's price momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy" signal suggests an optimistic outlook, but the MRI associated with it points to a 'Very Safe' approach.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent increase in relative divergence indicates short-term positive momentum.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return of -274.9% is concerning. This could be due to the specific model used for calculation or some specific factors impacting the projection.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

**Summary:**

*   **Performance:** RTX has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, but recent trends and news suggest a potential turnaround.
*   **Financials:** Strong recent earnings, increasing revenue, improving profit margins, and rising ROE indicate solid financial health.
*   **Technicals:** Recent price action is positive, but the RSI is neutral.
*   **Sentiment:** Analyst ratings are generally positive.
*   **Risk:** High Maximum Drawdown data from previous years suggests high potential for losses. The high Beta suggests that RTX might be more volatile than the market.
*   **News:** Recent news is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting record highs and strong defense orders.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data presents a mixed picture. While RTX has historically underperformed the broader market and exhibits high volatility, recent financial performance, positive news flow, and analyst sentiment are encouraging.

**Caveats:**

*   The extremely negative "Expected Return" value is a red flag and should be investigated further.
*   High historical Maximum Drawdown should be considered by risk-averse investors.
*   Beta > 1 means high volatility.

**In conclusion:** While the long-term return compared to VOO is substantially lacking and there are inherent risks to be considered due to high Beta, RTX is experiencing a period of strong, positive momentum. Whether this translates to long-term growth remains to be seen.
