**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

RTX Corp has recently experienced positive price momentum, hitting all-time highs driven by strong defense orders. Analyst consensus is generally positive with a "Buy" rating and price targets suggesting further upside. Recent earnings and financial performance show improving revenue, profit margins, and ROE.

*However,* there are significant concerns:

*   **Significant Underperformance:**  RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the longer term.
*   **Negative Alpha:** The consistently negative Alpha indicates underperformance relative to its benchmark after risk adjustment.
*   **High MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown indicates high risk with the stock.
*   **Very Negative Expected Return:**  The *extremely* negative expected return suggests a very poor outlook for future returns relative to the S&P 500 if an investment is made *now*, despite the recent positive price action. This could be related to an overvaluation issue after the recent surges.
*The recent price increases indicate the stock has surged to record highs as defense orders explode.*

**Conclusion:**

While RTX is currently experiencing a positive run, driven by strong demand and positive analyst sentiment, the underlying data reveals longer-term concerns and potential overvaluation. The extremely negative expected return should be a major red flag for potential investors. The investor should investigate the cause of the huge underperformance and if any corrective actions are being taken.
