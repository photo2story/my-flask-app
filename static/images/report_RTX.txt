Before making any investment decisions, it's crucial to conduct further research, address the data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings, explanation of expected return), and understand the underlying factors influencing RTX's performance.  The relatively high market capitalization indicates investor confidence despite the relative underperformance against the benchmark. Long-term investors should carefully consider the risk-reward profile given the volatility and the need for further investigation into the provided data.
