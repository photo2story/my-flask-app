**0. Executive Summary:**

RTX Corp (formerly Raytheon Technologies) is a major aerospace and defense company.  This report analyzes RTX's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), considering its recent price movements, financial indicators, and earnings data.  RTX exhibits strong recent growth but lags behind the S&P 500 in cumulative returns.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

RTX's cumulative return (89.72%) significantly underperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (112.87%).

| 2022-2024  | 33.0% | 15.7% | 1.0% | 0.9 | 153.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 42.0% | 15.7% | -11.0% | 0.8 | 173.9 |

The historical data shows fluctuating CAGR and significant negative alpha periods, indicating inconsistent outperformance compared to the benchmark.  The beta values vary, reflecting changes in the stock's volatility relative to the market.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $130.52
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $126.78
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $126.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $120.97

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively small difference between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages indicates a recent price increase, but the gap is not large enough to conclude a substantial short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 55.85  (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.0434 (Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum, but weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +25.2% (indicates short-term upward momentum)

The price change from the previous close (`{'price': 130.52, 'previousClose': 127.31, 'change': 2.52}`) represents a moderate increase, not a sharp jump.  The expected return of -20.9% suggests that the stock is currently overvalued relative to the projected long-term growth, implying that it is likely to underperform the S&P 500 over the next two years or more, given this prediction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue        |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1   | $20.09B        |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08  | $19.72B        |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29  | $19.30B        |
| 2023-10-24 | -0.68 | $13.46B        |
| 2024-10-22 | -0.68 | $13.46B        | *(Duplicate entry - likely a data error)*

Earnings show significant volatility.  Revenue generally increased, but EPS fluctuates, indicating inconsistency in profitability. The duplicate entry for October 2024 should be investigated and clarified.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX shows strong revenue growth and generally healthy profit margins.  However, its earnings are volatile, and its cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500. The -20.9% expected return, considering the current valuation, suggests long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) and a more thorough analysis of the market conditions and industry trends would be necessary for a comprehensive investment decision.  The relatively high valuation warrants cautious optimism.  Before making any investment decisions, consult with a financial advisor.
