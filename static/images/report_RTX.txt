## RTX Corp (RTX) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

RTX Corp is an aerospace and defense company.  The provided data shows RTX's cumulative return is 70.36%, significantly lagging the S&P 500 (VOO) which returned 122.07%. The difference is -51.7%, placing it at the 20.3rd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-66.1% to 4.8%).  The consistently negative alpha suggests underperformance compared to the market benchmark.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows inconsistent CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over the years, ranging from -24% to 35%. The beta consistently hovers around 0, suggesting minimal correlation with the overall market.  However, the negative alphas across multiple periods reinforce underperformance relative to the benchmark.  The relatively low maximum drawdown (MDD) in most periods is notable, indicating resilience despite market fluctuations.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $116.94 (Last Market: $115.98)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $117.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $119.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $121.15

The price is slightly below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.  The difference between the last market price and closing price is minimal, so there's no indication of a significant recent price jump or drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 43.37  - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, but closer to oversold territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.1997 - Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -4.7% - Shows a recent short-term decline in performance relative to the benchmark.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The provided data doesn't support a positive long-term return relative to the S&P 500.  Considering the historical underperformance highlighted by the negative alpha and the current technical indicators, achieving a positive relative return over the long term (2+ years) with a buy-and-hold strategy seems unlikely unless the fundamentals improve significantly.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  Q3 2023 saw a substantial drop in both EPS and revenue compared to previous quarters. EPS showed significant variation, with substantial increases followed by significant decreases across different quarters. Revenue shows some growth but lacks consistency.  There's no information to compare these results against expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates but shows overall growth trend except for a significant drop in Q3 2023.  Profit margins also fluctuate; the decline in Q3 2023 is particularly significant.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows some fluctuations, and ROE (Return on Equity) is similarly inconsistent, even turning negative in Q3 2023. This volatility suggests underlying operational inconsistencies that require further investigation.
