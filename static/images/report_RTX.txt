**Key Concerns:**

*   **Significant Underperformance:** Large divergence from S&P 500 and negative expected return.
*   **High Drawdown:** Substantial MDD figures highlight potential for large losses.
*   **Fluctuating Profitability:** While revenue is generally increasing, profitability (EPS and Profit Margin) is inconsistent.

*   **Revenue Growth:** Consistent revenue growth over recent quarters.
*   **Equity Growth:** Equity has shown an increasing trend.

**Recommendation:**

While there are some positive signals in the short term, the overall picture suggests caution. The significant underperformance, high drawdown, and extremely negative expected return raise serious concerns. Investors should carefully monitor upcoming news and announcements, particularly related to profitability improvements and drivers behind the negative expected return, before making any investment decisions. The recommendation of "Buy 80% of cash (5 shares - Caution)" reflects this balanced view. This analysis warrants further investigation into the reasons behind RTX's underperformance.
