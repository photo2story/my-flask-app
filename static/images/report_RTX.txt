*   **20-day Moving Average:** 143.578
*   **60-day Moving Average:** 134.426

### 3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return

*   **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -173.6% (Long-term)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The "Low Risk" MRI suggests that the overall market environment is relatively stable.
*   **RSI:** RSI is relatively neutral, providing no clear directional bias.
*   **PPO:** PPO is negative, which implies that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal recommends a high cash position and a very small reduction in holdings, signaling caution.
*   **Relative Divergence:** The recent decline in relative divergence confirms short-term downward momentum.
*   **Expected Return:**  The *highly negative* expected return suggests significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 if investing at the current price for the long term.

The small positive price change might indicate a slight rebound, but this needs to be interpreted cautiously given the negative trend.

*   **Underperformance:**  Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is a major concern.  The negative expected return further reinforces this concern.
*   **Recent Price Action:** The recent price action is inconclusive. A slight rise with the positive position of moving averages is tempered by a negative PPO, cautioning against over-optimism.
*   **Market Risk:** The MRI indicates a low-risk market environment, but the Hybrid Signal suggests caution specifically for RTX.
*   **Earnings & Financials:** Revenue growth and stable profit margins are positives. Equity is also increasing. However, ROE needs to be monitored for consistency.
*   **News:** Recent news indicates potential volatility.

**Conclusion:**

While the company has shown some revenue and equity growth, the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the negative expected return, and the cautious market signals suggest a need for careful consideration before investing in RTX. Monitoring the company's news and announcements, as well as the reasons behind its underperformance, is crucial. It's important to investigate *why* RTX is underperforming the market despite seemingly stable financials.
