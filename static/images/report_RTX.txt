*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:** -63.70 (Current), Relative Divergence: 16.6
*   **Analysis:** RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period. The divergence of -63.7% indicates a substantial difference in returns. The relative divergence of 16.6 suggests that the current underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2024-2026  | 44.0% | 80.4% | -62.0% | 0.1 | 246.2 |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** 44% is a high projected growth rate, but it's important to remember this is just a projection for 2024-2026.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** 80.4% MDD is very concerning. This implies high volatility and potential for significant losses from peak to trough.
*   **Alpha:** -62.0% suggests that, even considering the market's performance, RTX has significantly underperformed, indicating poor stock selection or company-specific issues.
*   **Beta:** 0.1 indicates RTX is much less volatile than the overall market (S&P 500). However, coupled with negative Alpha, this means it's not participating in market gains as much.
*   **Cap(B):** $246.2 Billion Market Capitalization

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and its Alpha supports this underperformance, and Max DrawDown indicates high volatility. However, recent financial performance is positive, with increasing revenue, stable profit margins, increasing equity, and improving ROE. Analyst sentiment is also generally positive.

The MRI suggest a high investment. However, the RSI is currently overbought, which might indicate a short-term pullback.

The news headlines highlight strong orders, and defense spending, which supports the positive performance.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data presents a mixed picture. While the underlying financials and analyst outlook are positive, the historical underperformance and high MDD warrant caution. The recent technical indicators suggest a potential overbought condition.

**Recommendation:** A high investment is not recommended at this point due to the overbought condition. Investors may wait for a consolidation or pullback before considering an entry point. Furthermore, investors should monitor the company's ability to close the performance gap with the S&P 500 and achieve its projected growth. Consider the long-term negative expected return before investing.
