**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (53.39):**  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions; the market is relatively neutral.
* **PPO (0.03):**  A small positive value suggests a slight bullish momentum, but it's not a strong signal.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change (+0.1):**  Shows a minor short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (-66.7%):** This exceptionally negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon (2+ years) is a significant concern and needs clarification on the methodology used to arrive at this figure.  It strongly suggests a bearish outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There's a large drop in EPS and revenue in Q3 2023, followed by a strong recovery in subsequent quarters.  The repetition of the Q3 2023 data in the table needs clarification; it's likely a duplicate entry. The fluctuations suggest potential operational challenges or seasonal effects impacting profitability. Further analysis is required to fully understand the reasons behind these fluctuations.

The sharp drop in ROE in Q3 2023 is concerning.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp has shown mixed performance, underperforming the S&P 500 over the given period.  While recent earnings show a recovery after a significant drop in Q3 2023, volatility remains a key characteristic. The negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further explanation. Technical indicators are neutral, suggesting no strong buy or sell signals.  A deeper dive into the causes of earnings volatility, specifically the Q3 2023 drop and the extremely negative long-term expected return, is necessary before forming a definitive investment opinion. The data suggests caution; the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 and the volatile financial metrics raise considerable concerns.
