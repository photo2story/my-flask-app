## RTX Corp Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

RTX Corp (formerly Raytheon Technologies) is a multinational aerospace and defense company.  As of the last data point, RTX's cumulative return (75.84%) significantly lagged behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (118.37%). This represents a difference of -42.5%, placing it in the 33.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $121.11
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $119.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $116.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $118.99

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The relatively small daily change (0.54%) doesn't indicate a dramatic price swing (neither a sharp rise nor a sharp fall).


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 64.63 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 0.64 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +3.7 (Positive short-term trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -56.3% (Long-term underperformance projected)

The positive PPO and RSI, combined with the recent positive relative strength change, suggest some short-term bullish momentum. However, the projected long-term underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is a significant concern.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      |

| 2023-09-30  | $69.60B    | -1.41%        |

Revenue shows a strong and consistent increase from Q3 2023 onward, while profit margins fluctuate, but generally remain high.  ROE is also variable.  The significant drop in Equity and negative ROE in Q3 2023 requires further investigation.


**7. Overall Summary:**

RTX Corp shows short-term positive momentum based on technical indicators. However, its long-term performance significantly underperforms the S&P 500, according to the provided data.  Earnings are volatile, and the financial data reveals inconsistencies that need to be addressed. A thorough investigation into the causes of the Q3 2023 financial performance drop and the duplicated earnings data is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The -56.3% projected long-term underperformance is a significant red flag.  Further due diligence, including an analysis of the company's future outlook and industry trends, is necessary before forming a conclusive opinion.
