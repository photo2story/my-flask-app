## RTX Corp Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

RTX Corp (formerly Raytheon Technologies) is a major aerospace and defense company.  This report analyzes its recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), and provides insights into its financial health and future prospects.  Key findings indicate underperformance relative to the S&P 500, though recent earnings show some positive signs.

**1. Performance Comparison to S&P 500:**

* **RTX (RTX Corp):** Cumulative return = 44.37%
* **S&P 500 (VOO):** Cumulative return = 76.08%
* **Return Difference:** RTX underperformed VOO by 31.7 percentage points.  This places it at the 56.2nd percentile of its historical relative performance against VOO (based on a range of -81.0% to +6.7%).

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying performance relative to market benchmarks (Beta) and excess return (Alpha) across different periods. Notably, significant negative Alpha values appeared in recent years (-54%, -46%, -22%), indicating substantial underperformance against the market during those specific periods.  However, more recent periods display improving Alpha.  The market capitalization has generally increased over time.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $129.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $128.47
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $129.57
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $128.35

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 60-day moving averages but below the 20-day moving average, suggesting some short-term uncertainty.  The recent price increase of $0.47 (from $128.64) is a minor positive change and doesn't suggest a significant upward or downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.96 (Slightly below neutral; suggests potential for further downside, but not oversold.)
* **PPO:** 0.0063 (Neutral; indicates a weak bullish signal)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +3.6% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -35.5% (This indicates a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term under the given assumptions.)

The combination of technical indicators suggests a somewhat cautious outlook.  The low RSI and negative expected return raise concerns, although the recent positive price movement and improving alpha could suggest a shift is in progress.

Revenue shows a generally upward trend, with healthy profit margins.  Equity fluctuates, and ROE shows some variability, with a notably low value in Q2 2024.  Further investigation is needed to understand the factors contributing to this fluctuation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the period analyzed. While revenue growth is positive,  EPS volatility and a negative long-term expected return relative to the market are concerning.  The technical indicators present a mixed picture, suggesting uncertainty. The relatively low RSI could indicate further potential for price correction.  The recent earnings data show some improvement,  but further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of profitability and to confirm this trend. A deeper dive into the causes of the volatile EPS and ROE is crucial to better assess RTX's long-term prospects.  The -35.5% expected return projection warrants caution and suggests careful consideration before long-term investment.  More detailed fundamental analysis, including an examination of the company's strategic direction and competitive landscape, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
