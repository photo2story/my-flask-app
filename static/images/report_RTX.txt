## RTX Corp Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

RTX Corp, a major aerospace and defense company, shows significant growth potential but also considerable volatility. While its cumulative return outperforms the S&P 500 in some periods, it lags behind in others.  Recent earnings show increasing revenue but fluctuating profitability.  Technical indicators suggest potential overbought conditions.  Long-term investment warrants careful consideration given its volatility and relative underperformance compared to the S&P 500.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

RTX Corp's cumulative return (87.22%) lags behind the S&P 500's (119.91%).

This indicates RTX has underperformed the S&P 500 in recent times but has shown periods of outperformance in the past.  The alpha and beta analysis shows varying levels of outperformance and market sensitivity (beta) over different timeframes.  Note that high beta implies higher volatility.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $128.95
* **Last Market Price:** $130.07 (a slight increase of $0.86)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $127.29
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $121.39
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $119.52

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend.  The recent price increase is a minor jump and needs more data to confirm a significant trend.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 76.29 – This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential correction.
* **PPO:** 0.69 –  A positive PPO suggests upward momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +10.6 – This positive change further supports the short-term uptrend.

Given the price increase and high RSI, there's a higher chance of a short-term correction.  The expected return of -32.5% relative to the S&P 500 over the long term highlights the risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1   | $20.09B       |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08  | $19.72B       |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29  | $19.30B       |
| 2023-10-24 | -0.68 | $13.46B       |
| 2024-10-22 | -0.68 | $13.46B       |

Note: There's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-22.  Assuming this is an error, the data shows fluctuating EPS and a general upward trend in revenue, especially in the last three quarters.  The significant drop in revenue and negative EPS in 2023-10-24 warrant further investigation into the underlying causes.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $20.09B | 20.08% |
| 2024-06-30 | $19.72B | 18.15% |
| 2024-03-31 | $19.30B | 18.45% |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.93B | 20.12% |
| 2023-09-30 | $13.46B | 5.30% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-09-30 | $61.11B | 2.41% |
| 2024-06-30 | $58.98B | 0.19% |
| 2024-03-31 | $60.48B | 2.83% |
| 2023-12-31 | $59.80B | 2.38% |
| 2023-09-30 | $69.60B | -1.41% |

Both revenue and profitability show a fluctuating pattern.  While revenue is generally increasing, profit margins show some volatility.  Similarly, equity and ROE exhibit variability, highlighting the need for further analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp presents a mixed picture. While revenue is growing, profitability and performance relative to the S&P 500 are inconsistent.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term correction due to overbought conditions.  Long-term investors should carefully consider the significant historical underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-32.5% expected return) and the stock's volatility (high Beta in some periods).  Further research is recommended to understand the reasons behind the fluctuations in earnings and the long-term growth prospects of the company before making investment decisions.  Analyzing the reasons for the significant drop in revenue and negative EPS in Q3 2023 is crucial.
