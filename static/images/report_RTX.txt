RTX Corp (RTX) is an aerospace and defense company.  The provided data shows a cumulative return significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO).  While recent performance shows strong growth, historical volatility and periods of underperformance are evident.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue     | Profit Margin |

| 2024-06-30 | $19.72B    | 18.15%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $19.30B    | 18.45%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.93B    | 20.12%        |

Revenue shows steady growth, while profit margins fluctuate but generally remain healthy.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE    |

| 2024-12-31 | $60.16B    | 2.46%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $61.11B    | 2.41%  |

| 2023-12-31 | $59.80B    | 2.38%  |

Equity shows some fluctuation, and ROE is generally low to moderate.  The significant drop in ROE in Q2 2024 warrants further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows strong revenue growth and generally healthy profit margins, but its earnings are volatile, and its performance relative to the S&P 500 has lagged recently.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings) require clarification.  Further investigation into the reasons for fluctuating profitability and the Q2 2024 ROE drop is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  The lack of a long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 prevents a full assessment of long-term investment potential.
