**6) Overall Analysis:**

RTX's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 over the given period. While the company shows some periods of strong growth and positive alpha,  recent performance has been weaker.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend.  Earnings data is volatile, needing further investigation to understand underlying factors. The financial statements indicate generally healthy revenue and profit margins, but ROE shows some inconsistencies. A long-term investment decision should carefully consider the high volatility, the significant negative expected return compared to the S&P 500, and the need for further due diligence on the causes of recent earnings volatility.  The -39.2% expected return requires further clarification and justification.
