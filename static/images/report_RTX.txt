**Overall Recommendation:**

The data presents a mixed picture. While RTX's fundamental financials appear strong, the stock's underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the extremely negative expected return are concerning. The analyst consensus and recent contract win provide some optimism. The "Buy" rating from the Hybrid Signal suggests the possibility of an upwards swing. However, the historical MDD shows a history of sharp declines.

Given these conflicting signals, it's recommended that investors perform further due diligence, considering their own risk tolerance and investment horizon before making a decision. It would be wise to look into the specifics of the negative return expectations to understand the reasoning behind it.
