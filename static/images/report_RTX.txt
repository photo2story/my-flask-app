* **EPS:** EPS is highly variable.  Q1 2024 and Q4 2023 show a substantial difference, suggesting possible factors impacting profitability. A significant loss was reported in Q4 2023 followed by substantial improvements. The October 2024 report exhibits two EPS values; one is positive and the other negative (presumably a duplicate entry).  Further clarification is required to fully analyze EPS trends accurately.
