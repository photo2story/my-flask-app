RTX Corp. presents a complex picture. While recent earnings and revenue figures show improvement, analyst consensus is positive, and news articles suggest potential future growth (driven by defense contracts), the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Key concerns include:

*   **Significant Underperformance:** The large negative divergence compared to the S&P 500 is a major concern.
*   **Negative Alpha:** Consistent negative alpha indicates underperformance relative to its risk.
*   **High Drawdown:** Large Maximum Drawdowns suggest high risk potential.
*   **Very Negative Expected Return:**  The drastically negative expected return from the model strongly suggests anticipating underperformance against the S&P 500.

**Investment Recommendation Considerations:**

*   **Potential for Improvement:** Recent positive earnings and analyst optimism suggest a possible turnaround, particularly if defense contracts materialize.
*   **Risk Tolerance:** Investors must have a high-risk tolerance, given the historical volatility and underperformance.
*   **Due Diligence:** Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the negative Alpha and expected return, and to assess the sustainability of the recent earnings improvements.
*   **Alternative Investments:** Given the expected return and performance metrics, investors should likely consider other investment options, especially in the S&P 500 given its strong cumulative return, or with similar risk tolerances.
