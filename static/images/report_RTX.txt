**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or market outlook information was provided in the initial prompt.  To fully assess RTX, recent news articles and analyst opinions would be required.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp is currently experiencing mixed signals. While recent revenue and (most recent) EPS figures show some improvement,  the substantial drop in revenue and negative EPS in Q3 2023, along with the consistently lower price compared to its moving averages, and a negative alpha relative to the S&P500, present a cautious outlook.  The oversold RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, however the lack of recent positive news and a long-term negative expected return relative to the market, requires further investigation before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated earnings data entry also necessitates clarification.
