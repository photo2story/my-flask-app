**Analysis:**

*   **Alpha:** The consistently negative alpha values suggest that RTX has generally underperformed its benchmark (S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis during these periods.
*   **Beta:** The beta values vary.  Some periods show negative betas, implying a potential inverse relationship with the market (though these are close to zero).  More recent periods (2021-2025) show betas significantly above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market.
*   **CAGR:** Fluctuating CAGR values point to inconsistent growth.
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values indicate significant potential for losses.

The recent price decline (-2.09 change) and the current price being below the 5-day moving average suggests short-term downward momentum. The 20-day moving average being above the 60-day moving average is a slightly positive sign, but the recent price action is concerning.  The significant price drop in the last market session highlights potential volatility.

*   **Equity:** The equity is showing a growth trend, reflecting an increase in the net assets of the company over time.
*   **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE is low, suggesting that the company is not generating significant profit from its equity. There's a noticeable spike in the latest quarter (2025-06-30), indicating improved profitability relative to equity. However, the ROE value in 2024-06-30 is exceptionally low, which might be due to specific one-time events or accounting adjustments during that period.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis**

*   **Underperformance:** RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 historically.
*   **Recent Downtrend:** Recent price action and technical indicators suggest short-term downward pressure.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Analyst ratings are generally positive, and recent contract wins are encouraging, but RTX is lagging peers in some areas.
*   **Financials:** Revenue, equity are relatively solid. Profit margin, ROE and EPS have some issues
*   **Technicals:** The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) suggests low market risk, which implies the company may be stable compared to some other industries in similar market conditions. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) nearing overbought territory (60.75) and a negative Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) of -0.13 suggest that momentum might be slowing, and the stock could be due for a correction.

**Conclusion:**

RTX presents a mixed investment picture. While positive aspects such as consistent revenue, strong sales and a low-risk market indicator exist, potential investors should be cautious. The stock's history of underperforming against the S&P 500, and the possibility of a short-term correction based on RSI and PPO, are significant factors to consider. The highly negative expected return is a major red flag. More due diligence is needed to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and the negative outlook before making any investment decisions.
