    *   The RSI is neutral, indicating no strong momentum in either direction.
    *   The PPO indicates a downward trend.
    *   The negative change in relative divergence confirms recent underperformance.

    *   This extremely low expected return should be examined closely for possible errors or abnormalities in the calculations.

The earnings reports should be examined closely.

**7. Overall Summary & Conclusion**

*   RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and its Alpha is consistently negative.
*   Technical indicators are mixed, with a downward trend suggested by the PPO and recent relative underperformance.
*   Analyst consensus is "Buy," but target prices vary considerably.
*   Recent news is a mix of positive (engine certification) and negative (stock drop).
*   Earnings and financial data show generally positive trends in revenue, profit margin, equity, and ROE, but there's an unusually low EPS value in the past, with duplicate date.
*   **The biggest red flag is the extremely negative expected return (-552.0%). This requires further investigation to determine the cause and whether it's a data error or a genuine indicator of serious long-term underperformance.**

**Recommendation:**

Due to the recent negative return compared to the S&P 500, the overall hybrid signal that is giving a buy rating, but the extremely negative expected return and inconsistent historical earnings, it is difficult to provide a clear recommendation without further investigation. Look at the root cause behind the expected return.
