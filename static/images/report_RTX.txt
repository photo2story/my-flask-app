## RTX Corp Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

RTX Corp (Raytheon Technologies Corporation, a major aerospace and defense company) has accumulated a return of 73.46% compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) return of 112.74% over the unspecified period.  This represents a difference of -39.3%.  The relative divergence of -37.9% indicates that RTX's performance is relatively lower than the S&P 500 compared to its historical performance range (max: 4.8%, min: -66.2%).

The provided CAGR data shows variable performance across different periods, ranging from -24% to 33%, highlighting significant volatility.  The consistently low or negative Alpha suggests underperformance relative to the market benchmark.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $119.47
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $116.61
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $116.34
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $119.25

The price is slightly above the 60-day moving average, suggesting a recent price consolidation or minor uptrend.  The price is notably higher than the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, possibly indicating a short-term upward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 62.39 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.37 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +17.9% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -46.3% (This is a significant negative expectation, indicating substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term)


The current price of $119.47, considering the moving averages, RSI, and PPO, doesn't suggest a drastic recent price jump or fall.  However, the projected long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-46.3%) is a crucial concern.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent and contains duplicate entries.  A corrected and consistent data set is needed for a proper analysis.  However, what can be seen in the data is a very wide variability in EPS from quarter to quarter, pointing to substantial volatility and possibly some significant issue (accounting, market, etc.).


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows a general upward trend, though there is a dip in Q3 2023.  Profit margins are relatively high and stable, except for a significant drop in Q3 2023. This needs investigation.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows fluctuations, but ROE is volatile, indicating varying profitability. The significant negative ROE in Q3 2023 is a critical point needing further investigation to determine the cause.


**7. Overall Analysis Summary:**

RTX Corp shows mixed signals. While recent price action suggests short-term positive momentum, the long-term outlook is significantly negative based on the projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (-46.3%).  The considerable volatility in earnings and ROE, particularly the Q3 2023 results (low profit margin and negative ROE), requires detailed investigation.  The inconsistent earnings data warrants further scrutiny.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough due diligence, including examining the causes of the Q3 2023 downturn in profit margin and ROE, is essential.  The currently provided information does not justify a long-term investment in RTX unless these concerns can be resolved and a more positive long-term outlook can be substantiated.
