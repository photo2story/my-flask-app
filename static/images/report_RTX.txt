## RTX Corp Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

RTX Corp, a leading aerospace and defense company, has shown a cumulative return of 77.05% significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's 121.84% return. While recent quarters show strong revenue growth, profitability metrics are mixed, and short-term price action indicates potential weakness.  Long-term investment potential needs further evaluation.


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

RTX's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) by -44.8%, placing it at the 30.1st percentile of its historical performance range against the S&P 500. This indicates that RTX's performance is relatively weaker than VOO's over this period.  The Alpha/Beta analysis shows significant variability in performance across different periods, with Alpha ranging from -0.5 to 1.4, indicating periods of both underperformance and outperformance relative to the market (Beta).  The negative Alphas predominantly in the 2018-2022 period suggest underperformance and  the positive Alphas in the later periods (2021-2025) signal outperformance.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 22.0% | 0.8% | -6.0% | -0.0 | 90.3 |
| 2016-2018  | 16.0% | 11.0% | -3.0% | -0.2 | 77.1 |
| 2017-2019  | 30.0% | 11.0% | -1.0% | 0.1 | 110.9 |
| 2018-2020  | -24.0% | 26.8% | -52.0% | -0.5 | 86.5 |
| 2019-2021  | 19.0% | 26.8% | -52.0% | -0.5 | 106.7 |
| 2020-2022  | 12.0% | 26.8% | 3.0% | -0.5 | 128.0 |
| 2021-2023  | 24.0% | 15.7% | 0.0% | 1.4 | 109.5 |
| 2022-2024  | 33.0% | 15.7% | 1.0% | 0.9 | 154.2 |
| 2023-2025  | 30.0% | 15.7% | -33.0% | 0.9 | 163.1 |


**2. Recent Price Action:**

The stock price currently sits at $122.41, down $3.43 from the previous close.  This indicates a recent downward trend. The moving averages further support this:

* **5-day MA:** $126.48
* **20-day MA:** $126.79
* **60-day MA:** $120.70

The price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it's above the 60-day MA, suggesting some longer-term support. The recent price decline of -2.73% is notable.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (44.21):** Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so.
* **PPO (-0.61):**  Indicates bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (-16.1):** Shows a recent weakening in the relative strength of RTX compared to the benchmark.  This reflects the short-term bearish price action.
* **Expected Return (-66.2%):** This is a very significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and should be viewed with caution.  The large negative number likely reflects the historical underperformance observed in the alpha/beta analysis, especially between 2018 and 2022.  A 2-year plus investment horizon might still be viable if the company addresses its underlying issues and demonstrates improved performance.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There's a noticeable jump in EPS and revenue in Q4 2024, but preceding quarters show mixed results, including a significant loss in Q4 2023.  Further analysis is needed to understand the drivers of this volatility.  Note that the data contains duplicate entries (2024-10-22 and 2024-10-22).


| 날짜       | EPS   | 매출         |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1   | 20.09 B$      |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08  | 19.72 B$      |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29  | 19.30 B$      |
| 2023-10-24 | -0.68 | 13.46 B$      |
| 2024-10-22 | -0.68 | 13.46 B$      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has shown consistent growth over the past year, with profit margins generally remaining healthy (above 18%). However, Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates significantly across quarters and does not consistently reflect strong profitability. Further investigation is required to determine the causes of this fluctuation and to evaluate the overall financial health and stability of the company.

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $21.62B   | 19.59%        |
| 2024-09-30  | $20.09B   | 20.08%        |
| 2024-06-30  | $19.72B   | 18.15%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $19.30B   | 18.45%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $19.93B   | 20.12%        |

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE    |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| 2024-12-31  | $60.16B   | 2.46%  |
| 2024-09-30  | $61.11B   | 2.41%  |
| 2024-06-30  | $58.98B   | 0.19%  |
| 2024-03-31  | $60.48B   | 2.83%  |
| 2023-12-31  | $59.80B   | 2.38%  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows a mixed performance picture. While revenue is growing and profit margins are generally healthy, the stock's performance significantly lags behind the S&P 500, both in the short-term (recent price action) and long-term (cumulative return and alpha/beta analysis).  The volatility in earnings and ROE raises concerns. Although the RSI suggests potential oversold conditions, the negative PPO and relative divergence highlight ongoing bearish momentum.  The extremely negative expected return should be treated with caution, as it reflects historical underperformance. A long-term investment decision requires a deeper dive into the underlying business drivers, future growth prospects, and a thorough risk assessment.  The provided data alone isn't sufficient to confidently recommend a long or short position.
