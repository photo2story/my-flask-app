2024-12-31 - Analysis Report
## RTX Corp (RTX) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

RTX Corp, an aerospace and defense company, shows a cumulative return of 66.99% over the analyzed period, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which achieved a 115.96% return.  The difference is -49.0%, placing it at the 24.2nd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This suggests underperformance compared to the broader market.

The provided CAGR data shows varying performance across different periods, ranging from a high of 32% to a low of -24%.  Alpha consistently shows near zero, implying the stock's performance is largely explained by market movements (Beta values also indicate a relatively low sensitivity to market fluctuations).  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates periods of significant losses, especially in 2018-2020.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $115.22
* **5-day Moving Average:** $116.49
* **20-day Moving Average:** $117.09
* **60-day Moving Average:** $120.73

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (44.65):**  Suggests the stock is nearing oversold territory, but not definitively so.
* **PPO (0.04):** A slightly positive value, indicating a weak bullish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (-1.3%):** Shows a recent short-term weakening of relative strength.
* **Expected Return (-88.7%):** This exceptionally negative long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern and needs further investigation to ascertain its validity.  The extremely low figure warrants caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals significant volatility.  While revenue generally shows growth, EPS demonstrates considerable fluctuation, including a substantial loss in 2023-Q4.  The most recent quarter (2024-Q3) shows a large jump in EPS compared to the prior quarter, but it's still important to note that EPS in 2024-Q3 is much lower than 2024-Q1 and Q2, indicating inconsistency in earnings. Revenue growth is not consistent either.  No information is given about whether these numbers met or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows generally increasing trends, with a slight dip in 2023-Q3 followed by a significant rise in 2024-Q3.
* **Profit Margin:**  Profit margin is volatile, experiencing a significant drop in 2023-Q3, but recovering strongly in subsequent quarters.
* **Equity & ROE:** Equity shows some fluctuation but remains relatively stable overall. ROE is similarly variable, with a period of significant negative ROE followed by inconsistent profitability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions to be completed.  No such information was provided.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows a mixed picture. While recent revenue growth is positive, EPS volatility and the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (as highlighted by a very negative expected return relative to the S&P 500) are significant red flags. The price is currently trending downwards based on moving averages.  Technical indicators suggest a potentially oversold condition, but the exceptionally negative long-term expected return needs further investigation and clarification. The provided data lacks crucial context, such as information on whether the reported earnings met or beat expectations and current market sentiment. Further research is necessary before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The extreme negativity of the provided expected return is especially concerning.
