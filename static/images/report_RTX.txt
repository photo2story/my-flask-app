2025-12-28 - Analysis Report
Here's a breakdown of the RTX analysis based on the provided data, followed by a comprehensive summary:

**1. Return Rate Comparison**

*   **RTX Corp Overview:** RTX Corp is an aerospace and defense company providing advanced systems and services for commercial, military, and government customers worldwide.
*   **RTX Cumulative Return:** 39.39%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 103.21%
*   **Divergence:** -63.9

| 2023-2025  | 41.0% | 79.2% | -27.0% | 0.3 | 248.3 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR & MDD:** The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) varies significantly across the years, showing periods of strong growth and sharp declines. The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, indicating substantial risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is consistently negative, meaning RTX has underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis.
*   **Beta:** Beta fluctuates, indicating varying degrees of correlation with the market. Some periods show lower beta, suggesting less sensitivity to overall market movements. However, in recent years the Beta has been over 1, meaning RTX is more sensitive to the S\&P500's movements.
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization has seen fluctuations, with a significant increase in the most recent period.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Close:** 185.17
*   **Previous Close:** 186.38
*   **Change:** -0.65
*   **5-day SMA:** 185.0
*   **20-day SMA:** 176.91
*   **60-day SMA:** 173.20

**Analysis:** The current price is slightly below the previous close and the 5-day SMA, suggesting a minor dip in the very short term. The 5-day SMA being higher than the 20-day and 60-day SMAs indicates an upward trend in the recent short-term.

**3. Market Risk Indicators**

*   **MRI:** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 76.74 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.58
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Very Safe)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 2.7 (+, Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return:** -262.9%

**Analysis:**

*   The high MRI score contradicts the recent underperformance, suggesting a potentially flawed risk model.
*   The high RSI indicates that the stock may be overbought and due for a correction.
*   The positive PPO supports the upward trend.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a buy recommendation.
*   The Recent Divergence Change indicates a short-term increase in relative performance, but the extremely negative Expected Return is concerning. The negative expected return suggests that despite its current price, long-term forecasts are not positive.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Headlines:** Several articles highlight RTX as a good investment or compare it favorably to competitors like Boeing. "RTX, Stock Of The Day, In Buy Zone With Business 'Firing On All Cylinders'" is particularly bullish. "How RTX Stock Gained 60%"
*   **Analyst Target:** "RTX Stock Prediction: Where Analysts See the Stock Going by 2027" suggests potential future growth.
*   **Comparison to Competitors:** "BA vs. RTX: Which Aerospace-Defense Stock Is a Smarter Option?" indicates ongoing evaluation and competition within the industry.

**Analysis:** Recent news coverage is largely positive, highlighting potential growth and comparing RTX favorably to competitors. This contrasts with the negative return rate data.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

RTX Corp has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in cumulative return. However, recent financial performance appears strong, with increasing revenue, EPS, and ROE. Analyst consensus is positive, with a "Buy" rating and a higher target price. Recent news coverage is also largely positive.

Despite these positives, the negative alpha, high MDD, overbought RSI, and extremely negative Expected Return are concerning. While the MRI suggests high investment recommendation, there seem to be discrepancies in the data that investors should be aware of.

**Overall:** The data presents a mixed picture. While recent financial results and analyst opinions suggest potential for growth, the historical underperformance and concerning market risk indicators suggest caution. A deeper investigation into the reasons for RTX's underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the discrepancy between the positive MRI and negative expected return is warranted before making an investment decision.
