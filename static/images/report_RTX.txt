**7. 종합적인 분석:**

RTX's recent stock performance has significantly lagged behind the S&P 500, indicating it's underperforming compared to the market benchmark. Technical indicators like the RSI suggest that the stock may be overbought, implying a potential risk of a price correction. The recent earnings data and analyst opinions are positive, with upward revisions of price targets and a consensus "Buy" rating. However, the long-term expected return is concerning, signaling potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500. The mixed signals suggest careful consideration is required before making investment decisions. Positive factors, such as recent financial performance and analyst sentiment, must be balanced against negative factors, such as technical indicators and the expected return.
