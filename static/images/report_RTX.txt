## RTX Corp Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

RTX Corp (formerly Raytheon Technologies) is a major aerospace and defense company.  Compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), RTX shows a significant underperformance.  While VOO has a cumulative return of 120.36%, RTX's cumulative return is 82.58%. This represents a difference of -37.8%, placing it at the 40th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  The provided alpha consistently shows near zero, indicating the stock's performance is largely correlated with the market, with beta also showing a relatively stable and moderate correlation with the overall market performance. However, the significant negative CAGR in 2018-2020 demonstrates vulnerability to market downturns.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $125.75
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $121.18
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $117.28
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $119.01

The closing price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a recent upward trend.  The relatively small gap between the 5-day and 20-day moving averages points to a potentially sustainable short-term uptrend. However, this should be viewed cautiously given the significant divergence from the 60-day average.  The price change from the previous close shows a significant positive one-day change (+3.83%),  indicating a recent surge but needing further analysis to confirm if it's sustainable.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 74.81 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.91 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Change:** +5.2% (Short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -42.6% over the long term (2+ years).

The high RSI value suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to a correction. The positive PPO supports the upward momentum observed in the price, but the overbought RSI needs to be considered.  The recent significant price change (+3.83%) from the previous close should be noted, although the overall outlook, while showing current momentum, forecasts  a negative long term return when compared to the S&P 500.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data is inconsistent, showing duplicate entries for October 2024.  Ignoring the duplicates, there's significant variability in EPS, possibly due to seasonal factors or other exceptional events.  Revenue shows a generally upward trend, although there's a significant dip in Q3 2023. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of these fluctuations.  A thorough review of the company's financial statements would be helpful to better understand these data points.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows consistent growth except for a notable drop in Q3 2023. Profit margins are generally high, though Q3 2023 experienced a significant decline. This needs further investigation to determine the cause.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable, with fluctuations likely related to earnings and share repurchases. ROE shows significant variability, with negative ROE in Q3 2023 and low ROE in Q2 2024, reflecting fluctuations in profitability.  The decline in profitability during Q3 2023 warrants further investigation.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows a short-term upward trend driven primarily by the overall market dynamics (as reflected in the near-zero alpha). However, its long-term performance significantly lags the S&P 500.  Technical indicators suggest a potential overbought condition, raising concerns about a near-term correction. The inconsistency and significant fluctuations in earnings and financial ratios, notably the drop in Q3 2023, need further investigation. Before any investment decision, a comprehensive analysis of these factors is necessary, along with a deeper examination of the underlying drivers of the Q3 2023 performance drop.  The long-term projected underperformance relative to the S&P 500  casts doubt on its long-term investment appeal, unless a significant change in the company's financial outlook is evident.
