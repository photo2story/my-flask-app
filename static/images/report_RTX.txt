## RTX Corp Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

RTX Corp (formerly Raytheon Technologies) is a major aerospace and defense company.  The cumulative return of RTX is 81.94%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 122.16%.  The difference is -40.2%, placing it at the 36.6th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data's range.  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows consistently negative alpha, indicating underperformance against the market benchmark (S&P 500), and a beta generally near 1, signifying similar volatility to the market. However,  a beta of 0.0 is unrealistic and needs verification. The substantial market capitalization (Cap(B)) indicates a large company.  The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates significantly, highlighting the volatility in RTX's performance.  MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values are notable, indicating potential significant losses during certain periods.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $125.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $124.57
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $118.65
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $119.02

The price is above its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum, but below its 60-day moving average which might indicate a potential for further price correction or consolidation.  The recent price change (-0.78%) shows a slight negative movement.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (73.02):** Indicates the stock is approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential for a short-term pullback.
* **PPO (0.96):** A positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (20-Day):** A positive change (+1.7) further suggests short-term upward movement.

Given the combination of the slightly negative closing price change, high RSI, and relatively high PPO, caution should be exercised.  The expected return of -49% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is significantly negative. This underlines the significant underperformance against the market indicated in the cumulative return comparison. A -49% return, particularly when the historical data shows such fluctuation, needs further verification and context as such a return is extremely unusual.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While some quarters show strong revenue growth and positive EPS, others reveal substantial losses.  There is a clear need for investigation into the causes of such volatility. The duplicated data entry for 2024-10-22 needs correction.


| Date        | EPS     | Revenue       |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| 2024-10-22  | 1.1     | $20.09 B      |
| 2024-07-25  | 0.08    | $19.72 B      |
| 2024-04-23  | 1.29    | $19.30 B      |
| 2023-10-24  | -0.68   | $13.46 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data reveals some inconsistencies. While revenue remains relatively stable, profit margins and ROE fluctuate considerably.  The significant drop in profit margin and negative ROE in Q3 2023 warrants further investigation.  High revenue doesn't always translate into equivalent profitability.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue  | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $20.09B | 20.08%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $19.72B | 18.15%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $19.30B | 18.45%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.93B | 20.12%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $13.46B | 5.30%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE    |
|---------|----------|--------|
| 2024-09-30 | $61.11B | 2.41%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $58.98B | 0.19%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $60.48B | 2.83%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $59.80B | 2.38%  |
| 2023-09-30 | $69.60B | -1.41% |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

RTX shows significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, despite periods of strong revenue growth.  The volatility in earnings, profit margins, and ROE raises concerns.  While short-term indicators suggest upward momentum, the high RSI and the long-term negative expected return (-49% relative to S&P 500) warrant caution.  A thorough review of the causes of earnings volatility and the unusually high negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistencies and apparent errors in some data (e.g., beta of 0.0, duplicated earnings data, extremely negative projected return) necessitates further verification and analysis from reliable financial sources.
