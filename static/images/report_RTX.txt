**Analysis:**

RTX has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period covered. The current divergence of -63.8 indicates a substantial gap in returns.

The provided range between Max and Min is too wide to be meaningful for investment decision. It is necessary to narrow the focus with additional data or clarify the logic.

*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analyst consensus is generally positive, with a "Buy" rating and a higher target price than the current price.
