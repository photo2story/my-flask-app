**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows mixed signals. While revenue and profitability are generally strong, recent price action, negative technical indicators (PPO, MRI), and the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 raise serious concerns.  The large negative price change and negative long-term expected return are particularly worrying.  The inconsistencies in the earnings data require clarification.  Before considering an investment, a thorough review of the earnings data inconsistencies and a deeper dive into the reasons for the recent price decline and underperformance are crucial.  The high market sensitivity (Beta) also needs to be considered within the context of broader market risk.  Given the current data,  the investment in RTX Corp appears risky at this time.
