**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX shows signs of growth in revenue and profitability, but its performance relative to the S&P 500 has been inconsistent.  While some periods demonstrate outperformance, a negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term is a significant concern. The high volatility in both EPS and ROE warrants further investigation into the underlying drivers of this variability. The current price is relatively strong compared to its recent moving averages.  However, before making any investment decisions, a thorough understanding of the reasons behind the earnings volatility and the relatively low expected return is crucial.  Further analysis including a deeper dive into the company's specific business segments and competitive landscape is recommended.
