    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating substantial risk and volatility.
    *   **Alpha:**  The negative Alpha values consistently show underperformance compared to the benchmark (likely S&P 500). This means that even considering the risk (Beta), RTX has not delivered returns as good as expected.
    *   **Beta:** The Beta values generally range from 0.5 to 1.2. A Beta near 1 suggests RTX's price tends to move with the market, while values slightly above or below 1 indicate slightly higher or lower volatility than the market, respectively. The Beta has generally decreased in recent years.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Price:** $187.25, higher than the previous close of $183.40. This signals positive recent momentum.
*   **Moving Averages:** The stock price is above all three moving averages (5-day, 20-day, and 60-day). The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day, which is above the 60-day, indicating an uptrend.

**3) RSI, PPO & Other Indicators**

*   **MRI:** 0.8 suggests Medium Investment recommendation.
*   **RSI:** 69.19 is approaching overbought territory (above 70). This could suggest the stock is becoming overvalued in the short term and might experience a pullback.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** Suggests buying 90% of cash (5 shares) and a monthly investment of 0.8% of total investment, implying a relatively safe approach. The cash ratio reaches 0% by 2026-01-02.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** +3.7 indicates short-term upward momentum.
*   **Expected Return:** -156.9% is a highly negative figure.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

*   **Mixed Signals:** RTX presents a mixed picture. While recent news headlines are generally positive, and analyst consensus points to a "Buy" recommendation, the stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the long term.
*   **Uptrend Confirmation:** The recent price action, being above all key moving averages, confirms a short-term uptrend.
*   **Overbought Concerns:** The RSI approaching overbought territory suggests potential for a pullback or consolidation in the near term.
*   **Financial Improvement:** Improving revenue, EPS, Equity and ROE are positive indicators.
*   **Record Backlogs and Structural Demand:** News of record backlogs and structural demand for RTX's products is encouraging for future growth.
*   **Major Caution:** The **highly negative Expected Return of -156.9%** is a significant red flag that requires further investigation. It contradicts the positive analyst sentiment and recent financial performance. Double check this metric.
*   **Investment Decision:** Based on this data, a cautious approach is warranted. While the recent momentum and analyst ratings are positive, the long-term underperformance and the potentially erroneous "Expected Return" figure suggest caution. A small investment in the short term, following the "Hybrid Signal" might be considered, with close monitoring of the stock's performance and further investigation into the Expected Return discrepancy.
