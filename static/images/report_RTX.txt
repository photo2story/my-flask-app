## RTX Corp Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

RTX Corp, a leading aerospace and defense company, has shown a cumulative return of 78.32% compared to the S&P 500's 118.31% over the analyzed period.  This represents a significant underperformance relative to the market, although recent quarterly results suggest potential improvement.  Further analysis is needed to determine if this underperformance is temporary or indicative of underlying issues.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

RTX's cumulative return (78.32%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500's (118.31%), resulting in a considerable negative divergence (-40.0%).  The relative divergence of -36.9% indicates RTX's performance is below the average historical relative performance against the S&P 500.


The provided Alpha/Beta analysis reveals a volatile performance history. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others display substantial negative alpha, particularly in 2018-2020 (-52% MDD!).  The Beta fluctuates, suggesting sensitivity to market movements, but with periods of significantly higher than average responsiveness to market conditions. This highlights the risk associated with RTX's investment.  Capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Current Price:** $123.29
* **Previous Close:** $124.48
* **5-day moving average:** $123.996
* **20-day moving average:** $126.7955
* **60-day moving average:** $121.0288

The recent price indicates a slight downward trend. The price is below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, and only slightly above the 60-day moving average, suggesting some short-term weakness. The recent -0.96% change signals a relatively recent small price drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 33.83 (suggests oversold conditions, potentially indicating a bounce back, although this indicator alone is insufficient for decision-making.)
* **PPO:** -0.67 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.3 (Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.)
* **Expected Return:** -48.9% (This extremely negative long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a significant concern and requires further investigation of the underlying assumptions.  This starkly contrasts the historical data and needs clarification.)


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS       | Revenue        |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1       | $20.09 B       |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08      | $19.72 B       |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29      | $19.30 B       |
| 2023-10-24 | -0.68     | $13.46 B       |
| 2024-10-22 | -0.68     | $13.46 B       |(Duplicate entry - likely an error)


Earnings show significant volatility.  There appears to be a duplicate entry for October 22, 2024.  The substantial drop in EPS and revenue in Q4 2023 needs investigation to understand the underlying causes.  The recent increase in EPS and revenue in Q3 and Q4 2024 (excluding the duplicate) suggests an improvement in performance, but further analysis is necessary to confirm this trend.

Equity fluctuates slightly, and ROE displays some variability, with a significant drop in Q2 2024.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows a mixed performance picture.  While recent quarterly earnings indicate potential improvement in revenue and profitability,  the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (-40%) and the extremely negative projected long-term return (-48.9%) are serious concerns that require further investigation. The historical volatility and negative alpha in certain periods highlight the risk associated with this stock. The high volatility should be considered carefully alongside the potential for higher returns if positive growth trends continue.  Further analysis is needed to understand the causes of past underperformance and the reliability of the projected -48.9% expected return figure.  Clarification on the duplicate earnings data point is also needed.  Additional due diligence is crucial before making any investment decisions.
