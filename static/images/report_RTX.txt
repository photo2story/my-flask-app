The price drop of $2.15 reflects a recent negative event that needs further investigation.  The conflicting signals from the relative divergence change and the negative price action warrant close monitoring. The very low expected return requires further clarification.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  While Q1 2024 and Q3 2024 showed positive EPS, Q2 2024 showed a substantial drop, and a large negative EPS in Q4 2023. Revenue has generally been increasing, showing growth.  However, the fluctuating EPS demonstrates inconsistent profitability.  A more in-depth analysis of the contributing factors to this volatility is needed.

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1    | $20.09 B      |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08   | $19.72 B      |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29   | $19.30 B      |
| 2023-10-24 | -0.68  | $13.46 B      |
| 2024-10-22 | -0.68  | $13.46 B (Duplicate Entry?)|


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is generally increasing, showing strong performance. Profit margins are relatively stable, hovering around 18-20%. Equity fluctuates, but the ROE shows inconsistent profitability, reflecting the volatility seen in the earnings data. Further analysis of the factors influencing these fluctuations is required.


| Quarter     | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $21.62B  | 19.59%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $20.09B  | 20.08%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $19.72B  | 18.15%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $19.30B  | 18.45%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.93B  | 20.12%        |

| Quarter     | Equity    | ROE    |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $60.16B  | 2.46%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $61.11B  | 2.41%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $58.98B  | 0.19%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $60.48B  | 2.83%  |
| 2023-12-31 | $59.80B  | 2.38%  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX Corp shows mixed performance. While revenue is growing, profitability is inconsistent, leading to significant volatility in earnings and stock price.  The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 considerably over the analyzed period.  The negative expected return raises serious concerns.  Before making any investment decisions, a deeper dive into the causes of the EPS volatility and the methodology behind the -34.6% expected return is crucial.  Further analysis of macroeconomic factors impacting the aerospace and defense sector is also warranted. The currently low RSI and negative PPO, coupled with the price being below its moving averages, suggest a cautious outlook in the short-term.  A long-term investment strategy should carefully weigh the risks associated with the stock's volatility.
