**Conclusion:**

RTX presents a mixed picture. While recent financial performance and analyst sentiment are positive, the historical underperformance, high risk, and extremely negative expected return are significant concerns. **The very low/negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is the key issue to investigate further. It's crucial to understand the methodology behind this calculation and whether it's accurate.** The MRI suggests investment, but should not be the sole factor in decision making.

**Recommendation:**

Given the conflicting signals, a cautious approach is warranted. Further research is needed to understand the source of the negative expected return. Potential investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct thorough due diligence before investing in RTX. A possible approach would be to monitor the stock's performance closely and wait for more clarity on the long-term outlook before making a decision.
