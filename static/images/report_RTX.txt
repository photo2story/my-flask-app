* **Revenue:** Generally trending upward, with a noticeable dip in Q3 2023.  The most recent quarter shows a substantial increase over the previous one.

* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity shows some fluctuation, and ROE is also volatile, reflecting the variable profitability.  Again, a significant drop in ROE is observed in Q3 2023. The sharp decline in both profit margins and ROE during Q3 2023 needs further investigation to identify the contributing factors.
