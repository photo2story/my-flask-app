## RTX Corp (RTX) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

RTX Corp is a major aerospace and defense company.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While the company showed periods of strong growth in past years, recent performance has been lackluster. Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying causes.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

* **RTX Cumulative Return:** 43.99%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 76.18%
* **Return Difference:** -32.2%
* **Relative Divergence:** 55.6% (Indicates RTX's underperformance is in the lower 55.6% of its historical range against VOO)

The table below shows a fluctuating CAGR and Beta, indicating volatility in performance and correlation with the market. Alpha values suggest periods of both outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows a general upward trend.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 32.0% | 56.7% | 0.0% | 0.1 | 90.1 |
| 2016-2018  | 22.0% | 64.0% | 1.0% | 0.5 | 76.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 37.0% | 64.0% | 3.0% | 1.0 | 110.5 |
| 2018-2020  | -24.0% | 64.0% | -54.0% | 1.2 | 86.3 |
| 2019-2021  | 15.0% | 61.4% | -46.0% | 1.4 | 106.3 |
| 2020-2022  | -13.0% | 69.5% | -22.0% | 1.4 | 127.6 |
| 2021-2023  | 2.0% | 69.5% | -19.0% | 1.1 | 109.2 |
| 2022-2024  | -1.0% | 69.9% | -22.0% | 0.7 | 153.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 15.0% | 69.9% | 0.0% | -0.0 | 172.1 |


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $128.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $128.84
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $129.29
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $128.43

The price is slightly below its 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term downtrend, but above its 60-day average, indicating a longer-term uptrend.  The recent price change (-$0.28) represents a minor decrease.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.75 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet decisively so)
* **PPO:** 0.075 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, but weak)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +1.9 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -36.3% (This is a significantly negative expectation; requires further investigation into the methodology and assumptions).


The recent price decline of -$0.28 does not constitute a significant event (neither a sharp increase nor decrease).  The negative expected return of -36.3% is alarming and needs more detailed explanation and context.



**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There's a substantial drop in EPS and revenue in Q4 2023, followed by a rebound in subsequent quarters.  The duplication of the October 2024 data point needs clarification.  A more in-depth analysis is necessary to understand the drivers of this fluctuation (e.g., seasonality, specific projects, market conditions).

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1   | $20.09 B      |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08  | $19.72 B      |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.29  | $19.30 B      |
| 2023-10-24 | -0.68 | $13.46 B      |
| 2024-10-22 | -0.68 | $13.46 B      |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable, with slight growth over the past year. Profit margins are generally healthy but show some fluctuation.  ROE is also inconsistent, suggesting variability in profitability and capital efficiency.  Further analysis is required to identify the causes of these fluctuations.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $21.62B | 19.59% |
| 2024-09-30 | $20.09B | 20.08% |

| 2024-03-31 | $19.30B | 18.45% |
| 2023-12-31 | $19.93B | 20.12% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $60.16B | 2.46% |
| 2024-09-30 | $61.11B | 2.41% |
| 2024-06-30 | $58.98B | 0.19% |
| 2024-03-31 | $60.48B | 2.83% |
| 2023-12-31 | $59.80B | 2.38% |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

RTX's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly, despite periods of strong growth in the past.  Recent earnings data shows considerable volatility, and technical indicators present a mixed picture. The drastically negative expected return (-36.3%) necessitates a thorough review of the underlying assumptions and methodology.  Before making any investment decisions, a more comprehensive analysis of the company's fundamentals, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is crucial.  Addressing inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate earnings data) is also necessary for accurate analysis.
