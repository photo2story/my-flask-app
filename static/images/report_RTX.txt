**Analysis:** The stock price decreased slightly in the last market session. The 5-day and 20-day moving averages are close to the current price, suggesting a period of consolidation. The 60-day moving average is significantly lower, indicating an upward trend over the past two months, although recent performance suggests a potential stall or pullback.

### 3. Market Risk Indicators and Outlook

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.329 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 41.88
*   **PPO:** -0.4352
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_66%_Sell 5.8% of holdings (24 shares - Caution - MRI:0.33) Dividend_0.68 (Cash Ratio: 66% on 2025-08-15)
*   **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** -5.9 (Negative - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -198.4% (Compared to S&P 500, long-term)

**Analysis:** The MRI indicates a low-risk environment. However, the RSI is below 50, suggesting weak momentum, and the PPO is negative, indicating the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average. The hybrid signal suggests a cautious approach, recommending a high cash position and selling a small portion of holdings. The negative change in relative divergence confirms a short-term decline relative to the S&P 500. The very negative expected return suggests a highly unfavorable long-term outlook relative to the S&P 500.

The recent price change of -1.18, while not dramatically large, contributes to the overall negative short-term indicators.
