**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

RTX Corporation (formerly Raytheon Technologies) is a major aerospace and defense company.  Its cumulative return significantly lagged behind the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, showing a -23.4% difference.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $117.45
* **Previous Close:** $130.23
* **Change:** -$9.81 (Significant decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $129.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $131.33
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $127.37

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend. The significant one-day drop of -$9.81 warrants further investigation for underlying reasons.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 26.13 (Oversold)
* **PPO:** -1.06 (Bearish)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +14.0 (Short-term upward movement, but this is likely due to a rebound after a significant drop)
* **Expected Return:** -26.5% (Significant negative expected return compared to the benchmark)


The technical indicators point to a bearish outlook. The low RSI suggests the stock is oversold, which could signal a potential rebound, but the negative PPO and high MRI indicate continued risk. The -26.5% expected return suggests substantial underperformance relative to the market over a longer-term period (2 years or more).  The large negative price change (-$9.81) indicates a substantial drop.  This should be investigated to understand the reason for the significant drop before any investment decision is made.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1    | $20.09B        |
| 2024-07-25 | 0.08   | $19.72B        |

| 2024-10-22 | -0.68  | $13.46B        |

Earnings are volatile, with significant swings in EPS and a noticeable drop in revenue and a negative EPS in the 2023-10-24 and 2024-10-22 reporting periods. This volatility needs further investigation to determine the underlying causes.  There is also a duplication of data for 2024-10-22 which needs clarification.

| 2023-12-31 | $59.80B    | 2.38%        |

Equity fluctuates, and ROE (Return on Equity) is somewhat volatile.  The significant drop in ROE in 2024-06-30 requires further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

RTX has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, although the degree of underperformance relative to its historical performance is moderate.  The recent sharp price drop is concerning and needs further analysis to understand its cause.  Financial statements show some volatility in earnings and ROE, which requires deeper investigation.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook, with the stock being oversold but still showing significant risk.  The negative expected return (-26.5%) over the long term compared to the S&P 500 warrants caution.  Further investigation is needed to understand the recent drop in share price, the volatility in earnings and the reasons behind the drop in ROE.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough understanding of the underlying factors driving the recent performance is crucial.
