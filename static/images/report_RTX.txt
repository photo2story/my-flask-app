The earnings data shows significant volatility.  There are inconsistencies in the provided data (duplicate entry for 2024-10-22).

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue        |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 2024-10-22 | 1.1   | $20.09B        |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has been relatively consistent over the past year, with a noticeable increase from Q3 2023 to Q4 2023 and maintained high levels in subsequent quarters. Profit margins are generally strong, exceeding 18% in most quarters except Q3 2023, which shows a significant dip. Equity fluctuates and ROE shows volatility, likely correlating with the fluctuating profits. A deeper dive into the reasons behind the Q3 2023 downturn is necessary.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

RTX's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 over the period considered, but shows recent signs of recovery.  The price is currently trading slightly below its moving averages. Technical indicators present a mixed picture, with the RSI suggesting a neutral position and PPO indicating bullish momentum. However, the significant negative long-term expected return (-52.8%) is a major concern. Earnings show significant volatility, requiring further investigation into the underlying causes of the large fluctuations.  A thorough review of the -52.8% expected return projection is crucial, as such a drastic negative forecast necessitates careful scrutiny of the methodology and assumptions used to generate that figure.  Finally, the substantial drop in profit margin and negative ROE in Q3 2023 demands detailed analysis to understand its impact on future performance.  Further due diligence is recommended before making any investment decisions.
