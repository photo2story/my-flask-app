* This results in a significant underperformance of -103.0 compared to the S&P 500.

The 20-day moving average is also slightly above the closing price, indicating a potential continuation of the short-term upward trend.

The RSI is above 70, indicating overbought conditions. A lower PPO score suggests bearish momentum. The recent relative divergence is negative, further supporting a short-term decline. However, the expected return is positive, suggesting potential for future growth.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, KHC is currently experiencing a short-term upward trend, but the long-term performance remains weak. The company's recent earnings have been volatile, and the technical indicators suggest potential overbought conditions and a short-term decline.  While the expected return is positive, KHC's underperformance compared to the market and recent volatility suggest caution for investors.  Further research and analysis are required to understand the future trajectory of KHC and determine if it aligns with your investment goals.
