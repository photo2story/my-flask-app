**5. Overall Analysis:**

KHC has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) in recent years, despite showing consistent earnings growth.

**6. Conclusion:**

KHC is a large and established company with strong brands. However, its recent performance has been underwhelming, and it remains to be seen if the company can improve its relative performance against the market. While there are some positive signs, such as recent earnings growth and the potential for modest future returns, investors should proceed with caution. It is crucial to carefully assess the potential risks and rewards before making any investment decisions.
