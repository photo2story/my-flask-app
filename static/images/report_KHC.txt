However, the positive long-term expected return may present an opportunity for investors seeking value and growth.

**Recommendations:**

* **Investors should consider a cautious approach.** The stock's recent performance and technical indicators do not suggest immediate strong gains.
* **Further research is recommended.** Investors should carefully review KHC's financial statements and future outlook before making an investment decision.
* **A long-term perspective might be beneficial.**  Despite recent underperformance, the potential for a positive return in the future remains, but requires patience and careful monitoring of the company's performance.
