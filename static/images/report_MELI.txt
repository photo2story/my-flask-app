*   **60-day Moving Average:** 2405.1533

**Analysis:**

The stock price is slightly above the previous close, indicating a marginal positive change. However, the price is below all moving averages (5, 20, and 60 days), suggesting a short-term downward trend.

### 3. Technical Indicators

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.3233 (Low Risk)
*   **RSI:** 38.31 (Approaching oversold territory)

*   **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.2 (Positive, indicating short-term upward momentum)
*   **Expected Return (%):** 271.6% (Long-term, expected outperformance vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

The low MRI suggests a relatively low level of market risk. The RSI value near 30 could indicate that the stock is approaching oversold conditions, potentially signaling a buying opportunity. The negative PPO suggests that the short-term momentum is bearish. The recent positive change in relative divergence could be a sign of short-term recovery. Despite the short-term fluctuations, the high expected return suggests analysts anticipate substantial long-term growth relative to the S&P 500. The Hybrid Signal recommending buying 90% of available cash suggests a positive, albeit cautious, outlook based on the MRI. The very slight price increase from previous close doesn't suggest any major immediate impact or volatility.
