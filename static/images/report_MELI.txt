**7. Overall Assessment**

MercadoLibre (MELI) has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, but recent data presents a more mixed picture.

*   **Positives:** High expected return (long term), increasing revenue and equity, strong historical CAGR and alpha (in some periods).
*   **Negatives:** Recent stock volatility, a negative PPO, overbought RSI, short-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500 (Delta Previous Relative Divergence), variable EPS, and significant maximum drawdowns. The negative alpha during 2020-2024 is a concern.

**Recommendation:** Given the overbought RSI and recent price decline, caution is warranted. While the long-term expected return is attractive, the current technical indicators suggest potential for a further pullback. Monitoring upcoming news and earnings announcements will be critical. It is advisable to closely monitor the factors driving recent EPS and revenue growth. Consider that the recommendation system gave a cautious buy signal.
