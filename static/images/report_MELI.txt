**7. 종합 Analysis and Summary**

MercadoLibre (MELI) has historically demonstrated strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO). However, recent signals suggest a potential shift in momentum. The current stock price is below key moving averages, and technical indicators like RSI and PPO point towards a bearish outlook. Recent news suggests heightened volatility and scrutiny around the company.

Financially, MELI continues to show strong revenue growth, high-profit margins, and increasing equity. The high long-term expected return suggests continued potential for outperformance, but this must be balanced against the risks indicated by the technical analysis. The hybrid signal recommending increased cash holdings is a significant warning sign.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is advised. While MELI has strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential, the recent negative signals warrant careful consideration. Investors should closely monitor future earnings reports, news events, and technical indicators before making any decisions. The current Hybrid signal suggests reducing exposure may be prudent.
