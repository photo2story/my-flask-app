*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 101.31%
*   **Absolute Spread:** 107.6
*   **Spread Range:** (Min: -25.7, Max: 587.2)
*   **Relative Spread:** 21.7

**Analysis:** MELI has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period. The current spread of 107.6 suggests a substantial outperformance.
