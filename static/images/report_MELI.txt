MercadoLibre (MELI) has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but current performance is near the lower end of its historical range.

However, the stock exhibits high volatility (high MDD) and is influenced by recent news and market events. Technical indicators show weak price momentum and call for a cautious approach. While the long-term expected return is exceptionally high, the short-term outlook is uncertain. Investors should closely monitor market news, company announcements, and industry trends before making investment decisions.
