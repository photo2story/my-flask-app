* **Expected Return (131.7%):**  A significant projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance relative to the S&P 500, assuming consistent historical trends continue.  This is a *projected* return and not a guaranteed outcome.  The fact that the last market price is only slightly higher than the closing price doesn't indicate a significant price jump or drop.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

GOOGL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term, but short-term indicators show some bearish momentum.

However, a lack of recent news and analyst opinions hinders a complete assessment of current market sentiment and potential risks.  The high projected long-term return is promising, but investors should carefully consider the inherent risks associated with any investment. The slightly oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term rebound is possible, but the negative PPO and negative relative divergence indicate bearish momentum in the shorter term.
