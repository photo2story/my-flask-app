**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Alphabet Inc. Class A (GOOGL) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products, including online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.

The cumulative return for GOOGL is 205.11%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 128.86%.  The difference is 76.2%, placing it at the 57.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided min/max range. This suggests GOOGL's outperformance is notable but not exceptionally extreme compared to its historical behavior against the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows consistently high Beta values (above 1.3), indicating a higher volatility than the market.  Alpha, while fluctuating, generally indicates that GOOGL has outperformed the market, although this varies year to year.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $169.23 (Last Market: $169.28)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $167.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $173.69
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $165.94

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The 5-day average is closer to the current price, indicating some price stabilization.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (34.95):** This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.8):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence (-12.5):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (131.7%):** This implies a substantial long-term (2+ years) outperformance compared to the S&P 500 if a consistent investment strategy is employed.  This should be viewed with caution, as future performance is not guaranteed.  The slightly higher last market price of $169.28 compared to the closing price doesn't suggest a significant immediate price jump (neither a sharp upturn nor downturn).

**8. Overall Analysis:**

GOOGL has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 historically, but recent indicators suggest a potential short-term downturn.  While the stock is currently oversold (RSI), negative PPO and declining relative strength warrant caution. The long-term outlook, based on the provided expected return, remains positive, but this prediction relies heavily on maintaining past performance, which is not guaranteed.  A thorough analysis requires incorporating current news, analyst sentiment, and a detailed examination of the latest earnings report, including EPS estimates. The financial data displays healthy growth but warrants further investigation into growth rates and profit margins.
