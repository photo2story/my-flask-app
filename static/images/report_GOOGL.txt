## Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Stock Review

This report analyzes Alphabet Inc. Class A (GOOGL), a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

GOOGL's cumulative return is 204.60%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 130.06%.  The difference is 74.5%, placing it at the 56.1st percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates GOOGL has generally outperformed the market over the analyzed period, although the relative performance fluctuates significantly.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $168.95 (Last Market: $171.38)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $167.94
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $173.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $166.14

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.  The difference between the last market price and the closing price is minimal and likely not indicative of a major price swing.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 36.99 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.73 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** NaN (Insufficient data to analyze)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 134.7% (This is significantly higher than the S&P 500's projected return, suggesting substantial potential outperformance in the long term.  However, such a high projection should be viewed with caution and considered within the context of the market's overall volatility and potential unforeseen circumstances)

The RSI suggests the stock might be undervalued, while the negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.  The lack of data for the relative divergence prevents a conclusive assessment of short-term trends.  The high expected return needs further justification and should be interpreted cautiously.  A 171.38 closing price wouldn't significantly change the analysis, though it would suggest a minor recovery from the closing price.

The data suggests a fundamentally strong company with good financial health, though the short-term price action warrants close monitoring.
