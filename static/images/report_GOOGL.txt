**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Alphabet Inc. Class A (GOOGL) is a multinational technology company specializing in internet-related services and products.  The cumulative return of GOOGL is significantly higher than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last date in the provided data is 64.3%, placing it at the 58.1st percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates that GOOGL has outperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**  The provided data shows that GOOGL consistently exhibits a positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) with a beta of approximately 0.2, indicating lower volatility than the overall market. However, this alpha and beta are highly variable across the periods presented and should not be used to forecast future results.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $174.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $172.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $173.43
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $167.98

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although it's important to consider the context of the longer-term trends and overall market conditions. The recent closing price of $174.68 is only slightly below the provided closing price, thus no significant changes can be inferred.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 53.34 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** -0.0275 (Slightly negative, suggesting a potential slowing of upward momentum or a slight bearish signal)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +5.7 (Positive short-term momentum)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 105% (This represents a significant outperformance expectation compared to the S&P 500, but it's crucial to remember that this is a projected figure and carries inherent uncertainty)

The positive 20-day relative strength change and the RSI above 50 suggest some short-term upward momentum, although the slightly negative PPO suggests a cautionary note.  The high expected return should be viewed with skepticism given the inherent risk in long-term market projections.
