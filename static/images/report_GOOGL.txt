The relative divergence indicates GOOGL's performance is in the 74.3rd percentile relative to its historical performance compared to the S&P 500.

* **60-day Moving Average:** $168.54

The recent price is below the last market close, suggesting a recent price drop. The price is above all three moving averages, indicating potential upward momentum, although the significant drop from the last market close suggests some caution is warranted.

* **Expected Return:** 82.3% - This represents a significant expected outperformance of the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) assuming consistent past performance. This projection should be treated cautiously, as market conditions change, and past performance is not a guarantee of future returns.
