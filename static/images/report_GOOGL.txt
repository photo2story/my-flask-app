* **5-day Moving Average:** $173.90
* **20-day Moving Average:** $173.95
* **60-day Moving Average:** $165.39

The price is currently below its 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downward trend. However, it's above the 60-day moving average, indicating potential support.

The expected return of 6.0% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is a positive outlook.  However, the current price ($167.64) is close to the moving average values, not indicating a significant potential for immediate, sharp movements (up or down) based solely on these figures.  Further analysis of news and market conditions is needed for a complete picture.


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows a consistent increase in revenue and EPS over the past year.  However, comparing the Oct 30, 2024 data points shows repetition.  Detailed analysis requires access to full financial statements and analyst forecasts to determine if this is a reporting error or a delay in the financial data availability.  Comparing EPS and Revenue against expectations for the most recent quarter is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of performance. This analysis is currently impossible due to the incomplete data.


**5. Quarterly Financial Data Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows steady growth, but profit margins have been relatively consistent, showing slight fluctuations throughout the period.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Both equity and ROE have been gradually increasing, indicating growth and improved profitability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  The prompt requested analysis of recent news (within the last two days) concerning earnings, market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights from sources like Shacknews and Finbold. This information is not provided and is essential for a complete analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

GOOGL has demonstrated strong long-term performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  While recent short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend, the long-term outlook remains positive, with an expected return exceeding the S&P 500.  However, critical information regarding recent earnings reports, analyst sentiment, and news events is missing, hindering a complete assessment.  The technical indicators are neutral, implying caution. A more comprehensive analysis requires filling the gaps in data, especially regarding the most recent financial performance against expectations, and accessing up-to-date news and analyst opinions.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the incomplete data, a definitive recommendation is not possible.  More thorough investigation of the missing financial data, and inclusion of the requested news and analyst reports are necessary for a complete and accurate assessment of GOOGL's current investment potential.  The current data is positive for the long term, however the lack of recent data is a significant concern.  A wait-and-see approach while collecting more data may be prudent before making any investment decisions.
