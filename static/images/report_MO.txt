**Performance Summary:**

1. **Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**  Altria's cumulative return of -9.9% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's 133.28%. This underperformance is evident in the large negative divergence of -143.18, indicating that Altria has significantly underperformed the market over the period considered.

The stock is trading slightly below its 5-day moving average ($51.09) and 20-day moving average ($52.32), while it is slightly above its 60-day moving average ($50.76). This suggests a short-term downtrend, but a potential for a bounce back due to the proximity to the 60-day moving average.
3. **Technical Indicators:** The RSI of 23.89 suggests that the stock is currently oversold, indicating potential for a rebound. However, the PPO of -0.47 implies a weakening trend, suggesting that the rebound might be limited.

5. **News and Recent Issues:** Altria is facing challenges from declining tobacco consumption and increasing regulatory scrutiny. The company is actively looking for growth opportunities in alternative products like heated tobacco and oral nicotine products. In the recent market outlook, analysts are divided on Altria's future prospects. Some remain bullish on the company's strong brand portfolio and focus on growth strategies, while others are concerned about long-term sustainability in a shrinking market.

Altria Group Inc. is currently underperforming the market significantly and is facing a challenging environment. While the recent earnings report was positive, the stock remains in a short-term downtrend with a limited expected return. The technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term rebound, but the long-term outlook is uncertain due to regulatory pressure and declining tobacco consumption. Investors should monitor the company's progress in transitioning to alternative products and consider the potential impact of regulatory changes before making investment decisions.
