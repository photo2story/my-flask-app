    *   20-day: 148.35
    *   60-day: 146.03

**Analysis:** The recent price decrease (-2.16) and the fact that the current price is below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages suggest a short-term downward trend.  The price is hovering near the 60-day moving average.

**3. Market Risk Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 64.80
*   **PPO:** -0.10
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (14 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 0.8% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-10-01)
*   **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** -1.3 (Short-term Decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -98.7 (Projected underperformance vs. S&P 500 over the long term)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.9 suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The RSI of 64.80 is approaching overbought territory, but is not there yet.
*   The negative PPO suggests a slight downtrend in price momentum.
*   The negative Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence confirms the short-term decline.
*   Critically, the extremely negative Expected Return (-98.7%) is a major red flag, indicating the model projects significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 if a long-term accumulation strategy is pursued from the current price.
*   The large price change from the previous close (-2.16) indicates notable volatility and potential negative sentiment in the market regarding PEP.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Headlines:**
    *   Articles highlighting PepsiCo's dividend prospects.
    *   PepsiCo's corporate branding overhaul.
    *   Articles highlighting PepsiCo as a potential dividend growth stock.
*   **Negative Headlines:**
    *   Reports of PepsiCo insiders selling shares (US$19m).

**Analysis:** Mixed news sentiment.  The dividend-focused articles are a positive, but the insider selling raises concerns about internal expectations for the company's future performance. The branding overhaul could be seen as either positive (modernization) or negative (abandoning core identity) depending on investor perspective.
