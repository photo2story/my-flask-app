**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly. While the company shows consistent revenue growth, earnings and profitability fluctuate.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend, although the RSI is near neutral. The negative expected return highlights the potential for continued underperformance relative to the market.  Further investigation into the drivers of the significant negative CAGRs in recent years, the volatility in earnings and profitability, and the reasons behind the fluctuating ROE is crucial before making investment decisions.  The data provided is insufficient to definitively recommend buying or selling PEP. More comprehensive analysis, including consideration of qualitative factors and future projections, is necessary.
