The cumulative return for PEP is 35.70%, while the S&P 500's is 118.37%. This results in a substantial difference of -82.7 percentage points. The relative divergence of -82.7 places PEP at the 1.3 percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating consistent underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $148.25
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $145.80
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $149.08
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $157.74

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-to-medium-term trend.  The recent increase from the previous close ($146.54 to $148.25) is relatively small and doesn't indicate a significant rebound.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 39.32 – Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.12 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.7 – Shows a recent decline in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** -529.7% – This extremely negative value for expected return over a long-term horizon (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is highly unusual and needs further investigation.  It's likely an error in the provided data or an outlier result. The negative result indicates a significant underperformance prediction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There's no clear upward or downward trend readily apparent from this limited data.  A more detailed analysis, including year-over-year comparisons and analysis of factors driving revenue and profit changes would be necessary for a comprehensive assessment.  Note that the data contains a duplicate entry for 2024-10-08.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | 23.32        |
| 2024-07-11 | 2.24 | 22.50        |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.49 | 18.25        |
| 2023-10-10 | 2.25 | 23.45        |
| 2024-10-08 | 2.25 | 23.45        |


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

Revenue shows some seasonality but generally remains high. Profit margins are consistently high (above 50%), indicating strong profitability.  Equity has been relatively stable, while ROE fluctuates, suggesting some variability in profitability and efficiency.  A deeper dive into the underlying factors contributing to these changes is recommended.

**7. Overall Summary:**

PepsiCo (PEP) exhibits mixed signals. While its profitability is strong, indicated by consistent high profit margins and generally high revenue, its performance significantly lags the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest the possibility of a short-term bounce, but the long-term outlook, as indicated by the provided (questionable) expected return, is highly negative relative to the market.  Further investigation into the exceptionally low expected return figure is crucial.  A thorough analysis of the fundamental drivers of both revenue and profitability, as well as comparison to industry peers, is needed for a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of PEP's investment potential. The current data alone doesn't provide sufficient grounds to form a strong buy or sell recommendation.
