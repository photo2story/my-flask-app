**8. Overall Analysis:**

PEP currently shows signs of underperformance compared to the S&P 500. While its financial statements generally appear healthy, the recent price action and technical indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest a bearish trend.  The low RSI could indicate oversold conditions and potential for a rebound, but the negative PPO and persistent underperformance relative to the market present cause for concern.   A deeper dive into the recent earnings reports and analyst opinions is needed to ascertain whether the recent dip represents a buying opportunity or a continuation of the downward trend. The consistent negative or low alpha values in the historical data further reinforce the underperformance relative to the broader market. The lack of a positive expected return in a long-term horizon also points to a cautious outlook.
