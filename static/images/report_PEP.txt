* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -0.45 – Indicates a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% – The provided data suggests no significant expected excess return over the S&P 500 in a long-term (2+ years) buy-and-hold strategy.  This is a reflection of the historical underperformance relative to the index.  The 163.42 last market price is not significantly above the closing price, so no sharp upward movement is indicated.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows some fluctuation.  While the October 2024 EPS ($2.13) is slightly lower than July 2024 ($2.24), it's higher than April 2024 ($1.49). Revenue generally shows a trend of staying in the $22B - $23B range, except for a peak in December 2023 ($27.85B).  More details are needed to compare against analyst expectations for the October 2024 results.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While some technical indicators suggest potential short-term upward movement (RSI nearing oversold), the long-term outlook is questionable, with an expected return of 0% relative to the S&P 500.  Recent financial performance shows stable revenue and high profit margins, but some volatility in EPS and ROE.  Thorough review of the latest earnings reports and analyst predictions is needed before making investment decisions.  A deeper dive into the causes of the underperformance relative to the market is crucial.


**8.  Recommendations:**

Based on the provided data, a long-term buy-and-hold strategy in PEP, solely for the purpose of outperforming the S&P 500, doesn't appear promising.  Further research is required to understand the reasons for the underperformance and whether it represents a temporary setback or a longer-term trend. The current low RSI might suggest a short-term buying opportunity for a bounce, but a longer-term investment requires a more optimistic outlook regarding PEP's ability to outperform the market.  Always consult a financial advisor before making investment decisions.
