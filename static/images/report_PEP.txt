**Analysis:**  PEP's CAGR shows significant variability year-over-year, highlighting the volatility of its returns.  The alpha is generally positive, suggesting some degree of outperformance relative to the market, but this has been inconsistent and even negative in recent periods. Beta remains relatively low, indicating lower sensitivity to overall market movements compared to the S&P 500.  The most recent years show a concerning trend of negative CAGR.

* **Closing Price:** $150.69
* **Previous Close:** $151.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $151.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $148.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $155.05

**Analysis:** The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend. The recent price drop (-$0.79) further supports this.

* **RSI:** 69.68 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.61 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.4 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -155.7% (This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and needs further investigation. The methodology for calculating this needs clarification.)


**Analysis:** While the PPO suggests bullish momentum, the RSI is nearing overbought levels, indicating potential for a correction. The positive relative divergence change suggests a recent short-term upward swing but needs to be contextualized against the broader negative trend. The extremely low expected return requires further explanation and validation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's long-term performance lags significantly behind the S&P 500, though it exhibits periods of positive alpha.  Recent performance is concerning, showing negative CAGR and high MDD. Short-term price action indicates a downward trend.  While the company shows strong and relatively stable profitability and high profit margins,  the recent earnings and revenue data show substantial quarterly fluctuations.  The extremely negative projected return requires critical review of the methodology.  Before making any investment decisions, further analysis is necessary to understand the drivers behind the recent underperformance and the validity of the extremely negative expected return figure.  Consideration should be given to the potential impact of macroeconomic factors and competitive pressures on PEP's future performance.
