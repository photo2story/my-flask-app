**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $151.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $149.87
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $149.44
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $148.04

The price is slightly above the 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent positive trend, but not a strong upward momentum. The last day's change of $1.51 represents a small positive change that would not be considered a sharp move either upwards or downwards.

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.432 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.39 (Neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.1352 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum but relatively weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +6.0 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 3.5% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

The indicators suggest a relatively neutral to slightly positive outlook. The positive 20-day relative divergence suggests an upward momentum in the short term.  The relatively low MRI indicates a moderate level of risk. The 3.5% expected return is quite modest.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13  | $23.32 B      |
| 2024-07-11 | 2.24  | $22.50 B      |

| 2023-10-10 | 2.25  | $23.45 B      |
| 2024-10-08 | 2.25  | $23.45 B      | *(Duplicate Entry)*


There's a duplicate entry in the data.  Revenue shows some seasonality, with higher figures in Q4. EPS is volatile.  A more thorough analysis requires removing the duplicate and examining a longer historical trend to account for seasonality.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| 2024-12-31 | $27.78B | 52.56%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $23.32B | 55.42%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $22.50B | 55.92%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $18.25B | 54.81%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $27.85B | 52.97%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity   | ROE    |

| 2024-09-30 | $19.45B | 15.06% |
| 2024-06-30 | $19.45B | 15.85% |
| 2024-03-31 | $19.05B | 10.72% |
| 2023-12-31 | $18.50B | 7.04%  |

Profit margins are consistently high, suggesting good profitability.  However, ROE is volatile.  Further analysis is needed to determine the reasons for this variability.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 over the given period. While recent price movements are slightly positive, the longer-term trend shows some concerns.  Earnings show some seasonality but also volatility.  High profit margins are positive, but volatile ROE warrants further investigation. The expected return of 3.5% relative to the S&P 500 is modest.  More comprehensive data, including a longer time horizon and a detailed examination of the reasons behind the volatility in EPS and ROE, are necessary for a more robust conclusion.  Consideration of macroeconomic factors and industry trends is also crucial for a complete analysis.
