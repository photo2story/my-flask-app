**7. 종합분석 (Overall Analysis)**

PepsiCo (PEP) presents a mixed picture:

*   **Underperformance:** PEP has underperformed the S&P 500, with a significant negative divergence in returns and alpha.
*   **Technicals:**  Oversold RSI suggests a potential short-term rebound. However, negative PPO and Hybrid Signal indicate caution.
*   **News & Analyst Sentiment:** Recent news is positive, and analyst consensus is "Hold" with a slightly positive target price.
*   **Financials:**  Solid revenue and profitability, but recent declines in EPS and ROE are concerning.
*   **Dividend:** Consistently mentioned as a dividend-paying stock.

**Conclusion:**

While recent news and analyst sentiment are somewhat encouraging, the underperformance compared to the market, negative technical indicators, and declining ROE warrant caution. An oversold RSI could represent a short-term buying opportunity, but the overall picture suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook for PEP. Investors should monitor financial performance closely for signs of improvement.  The strategic partnerships and focus on growth in the savory snacks sector could be positive catalysts in the future.
