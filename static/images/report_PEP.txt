*   **60-day Moving Average:** 144.74

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below both its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

*   **Expected Return:** -25.5% (vs. S&P 500, Long-Term)

**Analysis:** The RSI indicates that PEP is currently oversold, which could suggest a potential for a price rebound.  The negative PPO and the recent negative change in relative disparity confirm the short-term downward trend. The MRI suggests low overall market risk. The expected return of -25.5% compared to the S&P 500 over the long term is a significant concern, suggesting potential underperformance even with long-term accumulation. The recent price increase ({'price': 131.68, 'previousClose': 130.44, 'change': 0.95}) is a small positive, but should be considered in context with the other indicators.
