The stock is trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short-to-medium term.  The relatively large gap between the current price and the moving averages indicates a potential for further downward pressure unless a significant bullish catalyst emerges.

**3. Technical Indicators & Relative Divergence:**

* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-4.58):** Shows a recent downward trend relative to the overall market.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The expected return is currently very low, implying a neutral to negative outlook for the near term.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated to be negative based on the current performance.

The current price of $158.61, being below all moving averages and with negative momentum, doesn't indicate a sudden reversal (sharp rebound).  Instead, it points towards a continuation of the bearish trend, unless strong supporting news or unexpected positive events occur.

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows some volatility. While revenue generally remains high, there's some fluctuation in earnings per share (EPS).  The latest reported EPS of 2.13 is lower than the previous quarters.  Missing is a comparison to analyst expectations for the most recent earnings, which is crucial for a thorough assessment.  Further data, such as gross profit margins, operating income, and free cash flow, are needed for a complete financial analysis.

**5. Financial Information Analysis (Revenue & Profitability & Capital & Profitability):**

The provided data indicates that PepsiCo maintains strong revenue and profitability, with consistent high profit margins. However, Return on Equity (ROE) shows some fluctuation, suggesting possible variations in capital efficiency throughout the year.  A deeper dive into the drivers of ROE changes is necessary to determine underlying factors contributing to these changes.

**7. Overall Analysis (Summary of Points 1-6):**

PepsiCo's recent performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, with the stock trading below key moving averages and showing negative momentum. While the company maintains high revenue and profit margins, recent EPS figures are somewhat concerning.  The lack of analyst expectations and specific recent news prevents a full evaluation.  A thorough analysis requires additional information, including the company's long-term strategy, competitive landscape, and any potential catalysts that could significantly influence its future performance.  Given the current situation, the long-term (2+ year) investment outlook relative to the S&P 500 appears negative at this time.  Significant improvements in underlying financial performance or favorable market shifts would be necessary to alter this outlook.

**8. Recommendation:**

Given the current market conditions, and based on the data provided,  a cautious approach is recommended.  Further investigation is needed, including accessing up-to-date financial data and news sources to make a well-informed investment decision.  The relative underperformance versus the market and the negative momentum warrant careful consideration before any investment action.
