## 2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations

*   **Current Close:** 143.52
*   **Previous Close:** 144.16
*   **Change:** -0.44
*   **5-day SMA:** 143.888
*   **20-day SMA:** 146.951
*   **60-day SMA:** 147.2718

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), suggesting a short-term downward trend. The 5-day SMA being lower than the 20-day and 60-day SMAs reinforces this. The small price change from the previous close doesn't indicate a particularly sharp rebound or decline.

## 3) RSI, PPO Index, and Expected Return

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 23.49
*   **PPO:** -0.4256
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (Very Safe - MRI: 0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.5 (+): Short-term rise
*   **Expected Return (%):** 0.0

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** While the overall market risk appears relatively moderate based on the MRI, it does not reflect the divergence relative to the S&P500 or the company-specific trends (negative alpha).
*   **RSI:** The RSI is significantly below 30, indicating that PEP may be oversold, and a potential price correction (rebound) could occur.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating bearish momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal is recommending a full buy.
*   **Divergence:** There has been a short-term rise.
*   **Expected Return:** The 0.0% expected return is concerning. It suggests that based on the models used, PEP is not expected to outperform the S&P 500 over the long term. This aligns with the negative Alpha.

**Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. Some analysts see potential in PEP, as evidenced by the price target increase and institutional buying. However, other articles suggest caution or propose alternative investment ideas. The dividend streak remains a positive factor.
