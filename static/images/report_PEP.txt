*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values consistently suggest significant potential losses during the analyzed periods, especially recently.

*   **Beta:**  Low Beta values (around 0.1 to 0.6) suggest PepsiCo is less volatile than the overall market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):**  Shows the company's market capitalization.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 148.16

    *   5-day SMA: 149.84
    *   20-day SMA: 147.95
    *   60-day SMA: 146.88

*   **Analysis:** The current price is below the 5-day SMA but above the 20-day and 60-day SMAs. This *might* suggest a short-term downward trend within a slightly longer-term upward trend. However, the difference between the SMAs is small, indicating that price action is not particularly strong in either direction.

    *   **PPO:** The PPO is close to zero, indicating that the stock price is relatively stable compared to its moving averages.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** A "Very Safe" buy signal contradicts the very low expected return. This should be scrutinized.
    *   **Divergence Change:** Recent divergence change of -2.0 indicates a short-term downward trend in comparison to S\&P500.
    *   **Expected Return:** The exceptionally low expected return (-241.5%) is a very strong negative signal. It suggests that the model predicts substantial underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.
