## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Performance Review

**0. Overview:**  PepsiCo Inc. is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo's cumulative return (18.00%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (55.50%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -37.5%, placing it at the 30.8th percentile of its historical range (max: +23.3%, min: -64.6%). This indicates that PepsiCo's performance has been relatively weak compared to the broader market.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant volatility in PepsiCo's performance across different timeframes. While some periods showed strong growth (e.g., 2019-2021 with 53% CAGR), others experienced substantial declines (e.g., 2022-2024 with -39% CAGR). Alpha consistently remains close to zero, suggesting that PepsiCo's performance has largely tracked the market (Beta near 0.4), except for some periods.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth despite the fluctuating returns.  Maximum Drawdown (MDD) shows significant risk, especially in 2022-2024.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $142.32
* **Last Market Change:** -$0.59 (a decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $147.82
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $148.35
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $148.03

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend in the short-to-medium term.  The recent price drop of -$0.59 reflects a minor negative change and should be monitored for further developments.  No significant signs of a sharp reversal are immediately apparent.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk) - indicating a relatively high level of market risk.
* **RSI:** 35.36 (Below 40, suggesting oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.2863 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +12.5% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -11.6% - This suggests a negative expected return compared to a benchmark (likely S&P 500) over a long-term investment horizon.  This negative projection should be considered with caution given the long investment horizon and the fact it doesn't inherently reflect PepsiCo's potential to recover from a period of underperformance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PepsiCo's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, indicated by a significant negative cumulative return difference.  While the company demonstrates strong profitability (high profit margins), recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-to-medium term outlook.  The high MRI and negative PPO further support this.  Long-term prospects are uncertain given the projected negative return relative to the S&P 500, but this is a long-term projection that needs to be interpreted with caution.  Further investigation into the causes of the recent underperformance and volatility is needed before forming a definitive investment opinion.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings) need resolution.
