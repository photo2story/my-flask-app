While specific dates aren't provided, the cumulative return of PEP is considerably lower than VOO, indicating a need for further analysis to understand the reasons behind this divergence.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **PEP Cumulative Return:** 26.37%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 71.02%
* **Return Difference:** -44.6%  This indicates PEP significantly underperformed VOO during the analyzed period.

Further investigation into market conditions and PEP's specific performance drivers is needed.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis across several years shows mixed results.  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market, indicated by Beta), others, particularly recently (2022-2025), show substantial negative returns and negative alpha. This highlights periods of underperformance against the market.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally increased over time, indicating continued size growth for PepsiCo.  Maximum Drawdown (MDD) consistently shows significant potential losses in some years.

* **20-Day Moving Average:** $149.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $148.08

The closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The significant negative change (-3.14) from the previous close highlights a recent price drop, which should be investigated further for any triggering events.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk) – Indicates a relatively high level of market risk.
* **RSI:** 38.65 (Below 50) – Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -0.0112 (Negative) – Shows a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +14.5% – Suggests short-term upward momentum; however, this is contradicted by the current price being below the moving averages.
* **Expected Return:** -26.9% – This projects a significant negative return, likely reflecting the recent underperformance against the S&P 500.  This figure needs clarification on the time horizon. The statement "long-term (2+ years) investment" suggests a potential for outperformance over the long run, but this remains uncertain given the negative return prediction.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PepsiCo's recent performance has underperformed the S&P 500, as indicated by negative alpha and a substantially lower cumulative return.  While the company shows strong profitability and consistent revenue (with seasonality), recent price action suggests a downward trend.  Technical indicators point towards an oversold condition but also high market risk.  The provided -26.9% expected return requires clarification, as it seems to contradict the statement about potential long-term outperformance.  More detailed information, such as the time period for the performance comparison and the methodology behind the expected return calculation, is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.  Further investigation into specific macroeconomic factors, competitive landscape, and company-specific news is recommended before making investment decisions.
