2024-12-25 - Analysis Report
## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The cumulative return of PEP (38.80%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (117.56%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -78.8%, placing it at the 0th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500.  This indicates considerable underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided Alpha values consistently show positive outperformance relative to the market, but the cumulative return data suggests the magnitude of alpha wasn't sufficient to overcome the market's larger overall gains.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $151.29
* **Last Market Price:** $152.81
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $153.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $157.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $163.77

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the last market price indicates limited recent volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 28.36 (Suggests oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -0.34 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** 0.0 (-) (Indicates a short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This suggests that over the long term (2+ years), with consistent investment, the return is expected to be comparable to the S&P 500.  Considering the current underperformance this is a cautious prediction.)

The low RSI and negative PPO, combined with the price being below its moving averages, signal a bearish outlook in the short term. The last market price of $152.81 is not significantly different from the closing price, so there's no evidence of a sharp rebound or decline.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistency. There's a duplication of the 2024-10-08 data point.  Analyzing the remaining unique data points:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates between quarters, showing no clear consistent growth trend.  There's a significant drop from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024.
* **EPS:** EPS also shows volatility. It dropped significantly from Q2 2024 to Q1 2024.
* **Notable Beats/Misses:** Without expectations data, it's impossible to assess whether earnings "beat" or "missed" expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue demonstrates significant volatility. Profit margins remain relatively stable, hovering around 55%, but there's a dip in Q1 2024.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable. Return on Equity (ROE) is volatile, fluctuating significantly between quarters.  There is a significant drop in ROE in Q4 2023, which partially recovered in subsequent quarters.

The financial data indicates variability in both revenue and profitability, highlighting a need for further investigation into underlying factors driving these fluctuations.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or market outlook/analyst opinions were provided.  This is critical information missing from the analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  Technical indicators suggest a short-term bearish trend, with the stock trading below its moving averages and displaying oversold conditions (RSI). While the company's profit margins are relatively stable, revenue and EPS demonstrate volatility.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a complete assessment of current market sentiment and potential catalysts for future price movements.  The expected return of 0% suggests the investment's potential future growth is in line with the overall market,  but this prediction lacks the granularity to be conclusive.  Further analysis, including more recent data and news, is necessary for a more thorough and informed investment decision.  The significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 warrants careful consideration.

Further research, including incorporating missing data points (news, analyst opinions, and expectations data for earnings) is crucial for a comprehensive assessment.
