## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a global food and beverage company producing a wide range of products.  Over the reviewed period, PEP's cumulative return was 37.64%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 119.94%. The difference is -82.3%, placing it at the 4.1 percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (meaning it's performed worse than approximately 96% of comparable periods).  This indicates substantial underperformance compared to the broader market.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) over different periods.  Alpha consistently remains around 0.1, suggesting slight outperformance compared to the market, but this is overshadowed by the significantly negative total return. Beta is consistently around 0.1, suggesting a lower than average market sensitivity during these periods.  Note however that the most recent periods show negative CAGRs and extremely high MDDs, indicating significant recent underperformance. The substantial market cap (Cap(B)) demonstrates PEP's position as a large-cap company.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $150.37
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $150.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $148.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $155.49

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average, suggesting a minor short-term downward trend.  It is above the 20-day moving average, but significantly below the 60-day moving average, which suggests a longer-term bearish trend.  The recent slight increase of $0.08 compared to the previous close might be seen as a minor bounce.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 60.92 – This indicates a relatively neutral market sentiment; neither overbought nor oversold.
* **PPO:** 0.6652 – A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, although its magnitude is modest.
* **Relative Strength (20-Day):** +4.1% - This shows a recent increase in relative strength, potentially indicating a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -166.3% - This extremely negative figure suggests a significantly lower expected return compared to the S&P 500 for long-term investors. This highlights the substantial underperformance risk relative to market benchmarks.  This number needs further context to be meaningful (e.g., what model produced this forecast?).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While there are some instances of high EPS, (e.g., 2.24 and 2.25) others are notably lower (1.49), indicating inconsistent performance. There's also duplicated data for 2024-10-08 (which needs clarification).  A more in-depth analysis would require a longer time frame and examination of trends beyond the given data.


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information reveals a generally stable Revenue, although there's a dip in Q1 2024.  Profit margins are consistently high, suggesting good profitability.  Equity has shown growth over time.  ROE (Return on Equity) is fluctuating, indicating variability in the company's efficiency in using shareholder's equity to generate profit.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying factors causing this variability.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. While some technical indicators suggest potential short-term upward momentum, the long-term outlook appears bearish, especially considering the projected significant underperformance relative to the market and recent negative CAGR and high MDD values. The inconsistent earnings and fluctuating ROE further underscore the need for caution. The extremely negative projected return emphasizes the potential risks associated with long-term investment in PEP relative to broader market indices. More comprehensive analysis, including a review of the methodology behind the -166.3% expected return figure, is necessary before reaching definitive conclusions.
