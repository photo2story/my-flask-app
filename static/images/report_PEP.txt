## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a global food and beverage company producing a wide range of snacks, drinks, and other food products.  While its cumulative return (40.16%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) (116.17%), its financial health shows strong profitability.  However, recent negative CAGR and a high MDD suggest increased risk, while RSI and PPO indicators suggest potential overvaluation.  A deeper dive into earnings and financial data is needed to determine its long-term investment potential.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PepsiCo's cumulative return of 40.16% significantly underperforms the S&P 500's 116.17% return.  The provided relative divergence (-76.0%) indicates PEP's performance is well below the S&P 500 historically, ranking in the 13.1th percentile of past performance relative to the S&P 500's range (-90.9% to 22.8%).

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed signals:

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 22.0% | 2.2% | -6.0% | 0.1 | 135.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 8.0% | 7.1% | -11.0% | 0.1 | 129.3 |
| 2017-2019  | 29.0% | 7.1% | -1.0% | 0.6 | 164.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 24.0% | 7.3% | -3.0% | 0.7 | 183.9 |
| 2019-2021  | 53.0% | 7.3% | -18.0% | 0.7 | 221.8 |
| 2020-2022  | 29.0% | 7.3% | 20.0% | 0.7 | 236.8 |
| 2021-2023  | 23.0% | 5.0% | 0.0% | 0.5 | 229.0 |
| 2022-2024  | -27.0% | 5.6% | -60.0% | 0.4 | 211.6 |
| 2023-2025  | -20.0% | 5.6% | -77.0% | 0.2 | 213.6 |

While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), recent years indicate negative alpha and a declining Beta, suggesting decreased market correlation and potentially higher risk.  The significant negative CAGR in the last two periods (-27% and -20%) is a major concern.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 153.47
* **Last Market Price:** 155.71 (1.46 increase)
* **5-day MA:** 153.45
* **20-day MA:** 148.09
* **60-day MA:** 150.80

The last market price shows a recent price increase, exceeding the 5-day MA but still below the 60-day MA, suggesting some upward momentum but not a strong trend reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 67.89 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term correction)
* **PPO:** 0.68 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but needs to be considered with RSI)
* **Delta_Previous_Relative_Divergence:** +1.8 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -50.8% (This is a significant negative projection; the reasons for this negative projection need further clarification and analysis.)

The recent price increase (1.46) might be interpreted as a small rally.  The significantly negative expected return (-50.8%) warrants serious investigation and may point to potential underlying issues not yet reflected in the other metrics.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue       |
|------------|------|----------------|

| 2024-10-08 | 2.25 | $23.45 Billion | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*


There's inconsistency and a possible duplicate entry in the provided earnings data.  A more reliable dataset is crucial for accurate analysis.  However, we see some volatility in both EPS and revenue.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PepsiCo demonstrates strong profitability and consistent high profit margins. However, its stock performance significantly underperforms the S&P 500, with recent negative CAGR and a concerning -50.8% projected return.  Technical indicators suggest potential overvaluation and a possible short-term correction.  The inconsistent earnings data needs clarification.  Before considering a long-term investment, a thorough review of the -50.8% expected return projection and a more comprehensive analysis of the company's long-term growth prospects are necessary.  The high MDD shown in the Alpha/Beta analysis also indicates a higher risk profile than the S&P 500.
