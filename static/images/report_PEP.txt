PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a global food and beverage company producing a wide range of snacks and drinks.  While PEP's cumulative return (40.47%) significantly lags the S&P 500's (108.99%), its recent performance indicators show mixed signals.  While profitability remains strong, valuation relative to the broader market is low, presenting a potential long-term investment opportunity despite near-term price volatility.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PepsiCo's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's, resulting in a large negative divergence (-68.5%).  The relative divergence (19.7%) indicates that the current underperformance is relatively low compared to the historical range of divergence between PEP and VOO.  

The provided alpha/beta analysis shows varying performance across different periods.  While Alpha values generally indicate some degree of outperformance (positive alpha),  the Beta consistently remains close to 1, suggesting relatively similar volatility to the market.  The substantial negative CAGR (-27%, -20%) in the most recent two-year periods reflects a period of underperformance.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) consistently shows PEP as a large-cap company.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $153.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $148.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $150.60

The price is slightly below the 5-day moving average and above the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term price consolidation or minor upward trend.  The recent price decrease (-1.15) indicates a small downward movement, showing recent volatility.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PepsiCo shows strong profitability and consistent revenue generation. However, its recent stock performance has lagged the S&P 500.  The negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 requires further investigation into the factors contributing to this projection.  Despite the recent underperformance, the strong fundamentals and relatively low valuation compared to its historical performance and broader market suggest that PEP might present a long-term investment opportunity, particularly for investors with a longer time horizon.  More detailed financial modeling and a comprehensive risk assessment are needed before making a definitive investment decision.  It is also crucial to monitor the company's performance closely and revisit this analysis regularly.
