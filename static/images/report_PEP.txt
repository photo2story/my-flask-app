The recent news about emerging market growth is a positive factor, but it needs to be weighed against the other negative indicators.

**Recommendation:**  Based on the provided data, a **cautious approach** is warranted. The hybrid signal recommends reducing holdings. Investors should closely monitor PepsiCo's future performance, particularly its ability to improve its returns relative to the S&P 500 and stabilize its ROE. The significant price drop reflects a concerning trend. Given the negative expected return and recent underperformance, it is difficult to recommend new investment at this time.
