**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $142.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $143.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $146.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $147.86

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential bearish trend.  The recent price increase (1.96) needs further context to determine if this is a meaningful trend reversal or a temporary fluctuation.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.42 (Approaching oversold territory, but not yet definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.32 (Bearish signal)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.8 (Short-term upward momentum)

The combination of a relatively low RSI, negative PPO, and the price being below its moving averages suggests a bearish outlook. However, the positive 20-day relative divergence indicates short-term upward pressure.  The recent price increase of 1.96% could signal a minor bounce, but further confirmation is needed.  The expected return of 1.2% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is modest.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While there's a high in October 2024, there were declines in April and July.  Further analysis is needed to determine the underlying reasons for this fluctuation.  Note that there's a duplicate entry for October 8th, 2024; it's unclear which value is accurate.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's recent performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly.  While the company shows consistent profitability, recent earnings show volatility, and the negative CAGR and high MDD in the most recent periods raise concerns.  Technical indicators paint a mixed picture, with short-term upward momentum but a generally bearish longer-term outlook.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the recent underperformance and the duplicate earnings data is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Further research is crucial to assess the long-term potential of PEP relative to its peers and the broader market.  The modest projected long-term excess return over the S&P 500 warrants cautious optimism.
