## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

This report analyzes PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), a global food and beverage company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo's cumulative return (44.92%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's (120.91%) over the analyzed period.  The provided data shows a considerable lag of -76.0%, placing it in the 2.2nd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market.  The alpha consistently around 0.2 suggests that PEP's performance is relatively in line with the market, with a slightly positive outperformance. The beta of 0.2 indicates lower volatility than the overall market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $157.97
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $158.59
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $159.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $165.30

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (41.82):**  Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (0.07):** A positive value suggests a bullish momentum, but relatively weak.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (+2.2):** Indicates short-term upward momentum relative to the S&P 500.  However, this needs to be viewed in the context of the overall significant underperformance.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):** The provided data indicates a 0% expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This suggests that, based on this data, long-term investment may not yield superior returns compared to the market.

The closing price of $157.97 is not significantly different from the moving averages to suggest a dramatic price shift (either a sharp rebound or decline) based solely on this information.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates, with a notable dip in Q1 2024.  There's no clear consistent upward trend.
* **EPS:**  Similar fluctuations, with a significant drop in Q1 2024.
* **Comparison:** No information on earnings expectations is available, making it impossible to assess whether earnings beat or missed forecasts.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some fluctuations, but generally remains relatively high. Profit margins are consistently strong (above 50%) but show slight variations across quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable. ROE is volatile, reflecting the swings in profitability.

The financial data reflects some variability in both revenue and profitability, but overall the company appears financially healthy.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions are provided.  Information about market outlook is also missing.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PepsiCo (PEP) has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some technical indicators hint at a potential short-term rebound (oversold RSI, positive PPO), the significant negative divergence relative to the market and the low expected return raise serious concerns about its long-term prospects compared to a broad market index fund. The recent earnings show volatility, with no clear upward trend in either revenue or EPS.  More information, especially concerning expectations versus actual results and current news, is needed for a more comprehensive assessment.  The relatively stable financial position offers some comfort but cannot offset the underperformance.


**8. Recommendation:**

Based solely on the limited data provided, a long-term investment in PEP does not appear attractive compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), given the consistent underperformance and the lack of strong signals for future outperformance. Further investigation into current market conditions, analyst opinions, and a deeper analysis of the reasons behind the underperformance are strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.  The lack of current news and analyst opinions is a significant limitation to a full and accurate assessment.
