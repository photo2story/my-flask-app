| 2023-2025  | -23.0% | 75.0% | -90.0% | 0.4 | 196.8 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows the average annual growth rate over the specified periods. The CAGR has varied significantly, with negative growth in the most recent periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. MDD is quite high (over 60%) for most periods, indicating significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Measures the stock's performance relative to its benchmark (presumably the S&P 500, although not explicitly stated). A negative alpha indicates underperformance, which is evident in many periods, especially the most recent ones. The alpha has been trending downwards over time.
*   **Beta:** Measures the stock's volatility relative to the market. A beta near 0.4 suggests that PepsiCo is less volatile than the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Shows market capitalization in billions. Market cap generally increased until recently, reflecting growth. The more recent decline corresponds to the negative CAGR.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

**Numbers:**

*   **Close:** 143.78
*   **Last-market:** Price: 143.78, Previous Close: 143.74, Change: 0.03
*   **5-day SMA:** 145.282
*   **20-day SMA:** 147.5647
*   **60-day SMA:** 147.1112

**Analysis:**

*   The stock is currently trading below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.
*   The very small change in the "Last-market" data (0.03) suggests only minimal fluctuation on the latest trading day.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

**Numbers:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 46.38
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.45
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-11)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.0 (단기하락 - Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -241.5

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 1.0 contradicts the other indicators. Generally, a high MRI suggests a favorable investment environment, but the *negative* expected return signals significant risk. This discrepancy needs further investigation. (Most likely a bug in the MRI calculation.)
*   The RSI of 46.38 is neutral. An RSI below 30 is generally considered oversold (potentially a buy signal), while an RSI above 70 is considered overbought (potentially a sell signal).
*   The negative PPO (-0.45) suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downtrend.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a full investment, labeling it "Very Safe." Again, this is highly suspect given the negative expected return and other negative indicators. It directly contradicts the expected return and should be disregarded.
*   The negative change in relative divergence over the past 20 days (-2.0) confirms a short-term decline relative to the comparison stock (VOO).
*   The exceptionally *negative* expected return of -241.5% is highly concerning. This indicates a very pessimistic outlook for PepsiCo's long-term performance relative to the S&P 500. This is a critical red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

**Summary of Headlines:**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** Multiple articles mention a lowered stock rating, sinking stock prices, and potential problems with PepsiCo's stock.
*   **Dividend Focus:** Some articles highlight PepsiCo as a dividend stock.
*   **2026 Outlook:** One article mentions investors weighing year-end trading and PepsiCo's 2026 outlook.

**Analysis:**

*   The recent news sentiment is predominantly negative. The articles point to concerns about PepsiCo's performance and future prospects.
*   The focus on dividends suggests that investors may be looking to PepsiCo primarily for its income-generating potential rather than growth.
*   The reference to the 2026 outlook suggests investors are concerned about medium-term performance.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

**Numbers:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 2.71 (~Hold)
*   **Number of Opinions:** 22
*   **Target Price:**
    *   Average: 155.91
    *   High: 172.00
    *   Low: 115.00

**Analysis:**

*   The analyst consensus is "Hold," indicating a neutral outlook on the stock.
*   The average target price of $155.91 suggests a potential upside from the current price of $143.78, but the wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty among analysts. The low target price of $115.00 is significantly below the current price.
*   The lack of recent rating changes marked as ( )  →  ( )  suggests no recent upgrades or downgrades.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**Numbers:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2025-10-09 | 1.9  | 23.94 B$     |
| 2025-07-17 | 0.92 | 22.73 B$     |

| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | 23.32 B$     |
| 2025-10-09 | 2.13 | 23.32 B$     |

**Analysis:**

*   The earnings data shows some fluctuation in both EPS (Earnings Per Share) and revenue.
*   There's no clear, consistent growth trend in either EPS or revenue.
*   The duplication of the 2024-10-08 entry on 2025-10-09 implies a potential error in the data.

PepsiCo (PEP) presents a mixed but largely concerning picture based on the provided data. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Negative Trends:** CAGR and Alpha have been declining, especially in recent periods.
*   **Short-Term Downtrend:** Stock price is below its moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend.
*   **Concerning Indicators:** The *negative* expected return of -241.5% is a major red flag, suggesting significant long-term risk. The Hybrid Signal indicating "Very Safe" investment is not trustworthy and likely the result of an error in the model or inputs.
*   **Negative News Sentiment:** Recent news headlines point to concerns about the stock's performance and outlook.
*   **Neutral Analyst Rating:** Analyst consensus is "Hold," but target prices have a wide range, reflecting uncertainty.

**Overall Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, investing in PepsiCo (PEP) at this time carries a significant risk. The underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative trends in key performance indicators, and the alarmingly negative expected return strongly suggest caution. The data inconsistencies (Hybrid Signal and MRI values) further raise concerns about the reliability of the analysis model and the accuracy of the information being analyzed.

**Recommendation:**

*   **Avoid investing in PepsiCo at this time.**
*   **Conduct further, independent research** to validate these findings.
*   **Investigate the discrepancies in the data.** A negative expected return of -241.5% warrants thorough scrutiny.
