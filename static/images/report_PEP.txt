**Analysis:** The MRI indicates low market risk. The RSI is neutral, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The PPO is also neutral. The hybrid signal suggests a cautious buy recommendation, allocating 80% of available cash, with caution due to the MRI. The positive change in relative deviation indicates a short-term upward movement, but the very negative expected return is a major concern. Given the significant change in price, recent positive trend can be considered as 급반등(rapid rebound).
