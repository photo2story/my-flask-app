2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, let's break down the analysis of PepsiCo (PEP) based on the provided data.

**1) Return Rate Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** PepsiCo Inc. is a global food and beverage company.
*   **PEP Cumulative Return:** 12.72%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 91.40%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: -92.4
    *   Max: 12.1
    *   Min: -95.1
    *   Relative Divergence: 2.5

**Analysis:** PepsiCo has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period represented by the cumulative return data.  The current divergence is close to the minimum divergence seen in the data, and the relative divergence of 2.5 suggests PEP's performance compared to VOO is near the bottom of its historical range.  This means PEP is performing much worse than VOO.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year      | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---- | ------ |

| 2023-2025 | -20.0% | 91.2% | -82.0% | 0.2  | 196.5  |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuates significantly, with recent periods showing negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Has been high, indicating significant potential losses.
*   **Alpha:**  Measures performance relative to a benchmark (S&P 500).  Recently, alpha is strongly negative, indicating underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Measures volatility relative to the market. Beta has decreased to a low value in the most recent period.
*   **Cap(B) (Capitalization in Billions):**  Shows the company's market capitalization. It has decreased over the most recent periods.

**Overall Analysis of Alpha and Beta:** The recent Alpha and Beta figures are concerning. The negative Alpha suggests significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, while the decreasing Beta suggests lower volatility relative to the market, but not necessarily positive returns. The negative CAGR values in recent years are also a red flag.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 143.52
*   **Previous Close:** 144.16
*   **Change:** -0.44
*   **5-day SMA:** 143.888
*   **20-day SMA:** 146.951
*   **60-day SMA:** 147.2718

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA), indicating a potential downtrend. The recent price decrease suggests short-term bearish momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - **Note:** This seems contradictory to other indicators. High MRI values generally suggest favorable market conditions but don't guarantee a good investment for *every* stock.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 23.50 - **Oversold** (below 30 is typically considered oversold).
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.43 - Negative, indicating bearish momentum.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-11) - The hybrid signal recommends buying with 100% of available cash.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 1.5 (+): 단기상승 - Short-term increase.
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0% - No expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 in the long term.

**Analysis:** The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, which *could* suggest a potential buying opportunity. However, the negative PPO and the low expected return are concerning. The MRI indicates favorable market conditions, but given the other indicators, this may not apply to PEP specifically. The recent increase in relative divergence may suggest a short-term increase, but the other signals should be carefully considered.

PepsiCo (PEP) shows a mixed picture.

*   **Underperformance:** PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial negative divergence.  Alpha is also strongly negative.
*   **Technical Indicators:** The stock is technically in a downtrend (price below SMAs). RSI is oversold, which *could* suggest a bounce, but the PPO indicates bearish momentum.
*   **News Sentiment:** Mixed, with some articles highlighting dividend appeal and potential analyst upgrades, while others suggest better investment alternatives.
*   **Analyst Opinion:** Neutral ("Hold"), but target prices suggest potential upside.
*   **Financials:** Revenue and ROE fluctuate. Profit margins are stable.
*   **MRI:** Contradictory as the value suggests high investment recommendation but other factors point downward.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, investing in PepsiCo at this moment is questionable. While the oversold RSI *might* suggest a short-term buying opportunity, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative Alpha, downtrending price, neutral analyst ratings, and lack of expected return warrant caution.  A potential investor would need to carefully consider their risk tolerance, investment goals, and conduct further research before making a decision. The MRI could be inaccurate, it could just be a general market recommendation, it does not change the fact that all the other factors point towards selling/avoiding the stock.
