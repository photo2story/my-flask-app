**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's recent performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500. While the company demonstrates strong profitability and consistent revenue generation, the stock's price action shows a bearish trend.  Technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce, but the significant underperformance against the market raises concerns.  The extremely negative expected return figure needs further investigation.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the recent underperformance, including macroeconomic factors and company-specific news, is necessary for a comprehensive assessment.  The provided expected return of -754.4% is highly implausible and requires review of the source and calculation method.
