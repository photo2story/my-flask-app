**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

While alpha is generally positive (indicating outperformance relative to the market), it's inconsistent and drops significantly in the most recent periods.

This might be a result of macro-economic factors.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

PEP's current price ($143.39) is below its 5-day ($144.39), 20-day ($147.59), and 60-day ($152.05) moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 25.20 indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce. However, the negative PPO (-0.17) points to bearish momentum.  The recent negative relative divergence (-1.4) confirms a short-term downward trend. The extremely negative expected return (-770.6%) is a significant red flag.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. There's a notable drop in EPS and revenue in Q1 2024 (April 23rd), followed by an increase in Q2 and Q3 (July 11th and October 8th).  Inconsistencies in the data (duplicate entry for 2024-10-08) require clarification.  A more detailed and consistent dataset is necessary for a robust analysis.


| 날짜       | EPS | 매출         |

| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | 23.32 B$    |
| 2024-07-11 | 2.24 | 22.50 B$    |

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial analysis.  This is a major limitation of the provided data.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some technical indicators (RSI) suggest potential for a short-term rebound, the overall picture is bearish. The negative PPO, negative relative divergence, and extremely negative long-term expected return raise significant concerns.  The lack of complete financial data further hinders a thorough assessment.  The inconsistent earnings data requires further investigation. More data is needed for a reliable long-term investment decision.  The current data strongly suggests that PEP is not a strong performer relative to the broader market.
