## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**0) Introduction:**  This report analyzes PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), a global food and beverage company, based on provided financial and market data.  We will compare its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), assess its recent price movements, and evaluate key financial indicators.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

PepsiCo's cumulative return is 35.85%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's 76.31% return.  The difference is -40.5%, placing it at the 24th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on a minimum difference of -62.6% and a maximum of 29.5%).  This suggests PEP underperformed the broader market over the measured period.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows variable performance across different periods.  While some periods exhibit positive alpha (outperformance), others show significant underperformance, particularly in 2022-2025.  The Beta generally hovers around 0.3-0.5, indicating lower volatility than the overall market. Market capitalization remains consistently high, fluctuating around $200B.

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $143.46
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $142.19
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $145.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $147.69

The current closing price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short-to-medium term.  The recent price increase (Last-market data showing a $1.22 increase) is a minor positive deviation from this trend, but further observation is needed to confirm any significant change.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.435 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 41.25 (Suggests the stock is possibly oversold, but not definitively)
* **PPO:** -0.20 (Negative PPO indicates bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** 2.5% increase (short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.8% (This is a very low expected return. The context for this number is needed to make any meaningful conclusion.)

The combination of a medium risk rating, oversold RSI, negative PPO, and low expected return indicates a cautious outlook.  The recent price increase, however, suggests some potential short-term buying interest.  The low expected return, however, significantly diminishes long-term appeal, especially in comparison to the S&P 500.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PepsiCo's performance relative to the S&P 500 has been underwhelming, showing significant underperformance. While the company maintains high profit margins and a large market capitalization, its recent price action indicates a bearish trend.  Technical indicators paint a mixed picture, with RSI suggesting potential oversold conditions, but PPO indicating bearish momentum.  The low expected return raises concerns about long-term investment potential.  A thorough examination of earnings data is needed to eliminate data errors and determine underlying trends.  Given the current data, a neutral-to-bearish outlook is warranted.  Further investigation into the macroeconomic factors influencing PEP's performance relative to the S&P 500 would be beneficial.  The low expected return, specifically, needs clarification as to its basis.
