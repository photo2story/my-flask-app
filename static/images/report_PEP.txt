**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), a global food and beverage company, based on provided financial data. We'll examine its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), recent price movements, technical indicators, earnings, and financial information.

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's.

* **PEP Cumulative Return:** 40.70%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 108.62%
* **Return Difference:** -67.9%

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals varying performance over different periods.  While positive Alpha indicates outperformance in several years (particularly 2017-2021), the negative Alpha in recent years (2022-2025) and relatively low Beta suggest lower volatility and less correlation with the overall market. The Market Capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuates around $200 Billion.  The consistently high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) indicates significant periods of price decline.

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $150.39

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting minor short-term bearish pressure.  However, it's above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend. The recent price increase of $0.77 (0.5%) from the previous close signifies a minor positive movement.

* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -30.5% (This suggests a significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.)

The combination of a relatively high RSI and a positive PPO indicates mixed signals. While momentum is positive, the market might be approaching overbought conditions.  The negative expected return requires careful consideration.
