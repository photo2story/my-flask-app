The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows significant volatility, with periods of strong growth and recent significant declines.

* **Closing Price:** $141.73
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $142.85
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $145.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $147.77

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-to-medium term trend. The recent price change (-$0.78) shows a minor decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 37.93 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.31 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** +6.4 (Short-term upward trend in relative divergence)
* **Expected Return:** 0.8% (This is a low expected return relative to the long term potential of the S&P 500, and may require a re-evaluation given the other indicators.)

The indicators present a mixed picture. While the RSI suggests potential for a bounce, the negative PPO and the price being below moving averages point to a bearish trend.  The small price drop in the provided `Last-market` data is not significant enough to indicate a sharp decline. The low expected return given the historical data suggests a critical evaluation of continued investment.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's recent performance has underperformed the S&P 500, showing a significant negative divergence. While the company displays strong fundamentals (high profit margins, consistent revenue), recent price action and technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term outlook.  The low expected return and negative alpha raise concerns regarding long-term outperformance compared to the market.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the recent earnings volatility and the sustained underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A long-term investment strategy may be viable if the underlying issues driving the underperformance are addressed and the expected return improves.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data should be corrected for a more accurate analysis.
