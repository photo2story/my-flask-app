2024-12-25 - Analysis Report
## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The cumulative return of PEP is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The difference in cumulative returns is 78.8%, indicating PEP underperformed VOO substantially.  The provided data shows a negative alpha (-6% to -63% depending on the period), suggesting the stock underperformed its benchmark even when accounting for market risk.  The beta consistently remains around 0.2, indicating low sensitivity to market fluctuations.  However, the high maximum drawdown (MDD) of up to 63% highlights significant periods of risk.  The company's market capitalization fluctuates between $128B and $233B.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $151.29
* **Last Market Price:** $152.81
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $153.22
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $157.94
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $163.77

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The relatively small gap between the closing price and the last market price indicates limited recent volatility.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (28.36):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.34):** Shows a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (0.0):** Suggests no recent significant divergence.  
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided data does not give a reliable expected return for future periods. The 0% given likely refers to the difference between PEP and VOO's expected returns and not PEP's expected return alone.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy with regular contributions would require a more sophisticated model incorporating future earnings forecasts and market expectations.  The fact that the current price is below the moving averages coupled with the low RSI and negative PPO indicate downside risk. The 0.0 value here, however, does not take this into account.  A negative return might be predicted given the current market conditions.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals inconsistencies, particularly with a duplicated entry for October 8th, 2024.  Discounting the duplication, we see the following:

* **Revenue:**  Revenue fluctuates considerably, with a high of $23.45B in Q4 2023 and a low of $18.25B in Q1 2024. While the company consistently reports high figures, there is a lack of clear and consistent growth trends across the presented quarters.
* **EPS:**  EPS also demonstrates volatility with significant fluctuations between quarters.  There is no clear trend.  A deeper dive into the market expectations for each quarter would be needed to determine "beats" or "misses".

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some seasonality, with lower revenues in Q1. Profit margins are consistently high, above 50%, though there’s minor fluctuation. The large drop in revenue from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024 warrants further investigation.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable.  ROE shows significant variability between quarters, potentially influenced by factors such as changes in net income and shareholder equity.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or analyst opinions were provided, making it impossible to comment on recent market outlooks or any significant issues affecting the company.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly, as indicated by a considerably lower cumulative return. The stock shows signs of a bearish trend based on its price relative to moving averages and negative technical indicators. While the company reports high revenue and profit margins, there is considerable volatility in both revenue and EPS, and clear trends aren’t immediately apparent.  Further investigation is required into the specifics of the revenue and EPS figures to gain a better understanding of PEP's performance. More information regarding the market expectations for the reported quarters is also crucial. The lack of recent news and analyst commentary limits the ability to provide a comprehensive assessment of current market sentiment toward PEP. The 0% expected return should be treated with caution given the current market conditions and technical indicators. A more detailed analysis with the missing information would provide a more complete and reliable assessment.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the underperformance compared to the S&P 500, negative technical indicators, and the volatility in earnings, a cautious approach is warranted. Additional research is needed before making any investment decisions.  This includes reviewing the missing information and comparing actual results against analysts' expectations for each quarter.  A long-term investment strategy should also be approached cautiously given the high volatility and high maximum drawdown.  More information is needed for a proper assessment of the risk-reward profile.
