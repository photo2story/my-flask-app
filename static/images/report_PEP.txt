* **Relative Divergence (20-day):** -2.7, signifying a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return (-287.6%):**  This extremely negative figure implies a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period, showing a substantial negative cumulative return.  Technical indicators suggest oversold conditions but also negative momentum.  Recent earnings data reveals revenue and EPS fluctuations, without clear upward trends. The projected long-term underperformance against the S&P 500 (-287.6%) needs to be viewed with significant caution given its magnitude and likely reliance on historical correlations.

A more thorough analysis requires additional data, especially concerning earnings expectations and market sentiment.
