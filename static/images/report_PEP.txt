*   **CAGR:** The Compounded Annual Growth Rate shows significant volatility, ranging from -27% to 37%, highlighting periods of strong growth and significant decline.  The recent negative CAGRs (-27% and -20%) are concerning.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown indicates the potential loss from peak to trough. MDD are relatively consistent, between 9% and 19.7% indicating moderate risk management during downturns.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures performance relative to a benchmark.  The negative and sharply decreasing Alpha values in recent periods (-47% and -82%) suggest significant underperformance compared to the market or its peers.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures volatility compared to the market.  The Beta values are consistently below 1, suggesting that PEP is less volatile than the overall market (S&P 500). The decrease in beta in recent periods (0.8 -> 0.2) can suggest low sensitivity to market movements.
*   **Cap(B):** Market Cap fluctuates, reflecting market valuation of the company.

**In summary:** The data indicates PepsiCo has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Recent performance metrics like CAGR and Alpha raise concerns.

**Analysis:**

*   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 100% of cash" signal with a high MRI (0.90) suggests a potentially safe entry point based on technical indicators, but this contradicts the negative expected return.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The short-term increase in relative divergence suggests a recent bounce, although small.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return (-787.9%) is highly concerning and suggests significant risk and potential for further decline.

*   **News:** Recent news is mixed, with some negative headlines related to institutional selling and stock dips.
*   **Financial Health:** While revenue fluctuates, profit margins remain strong. ROE varies across quarters.
*   **Significant Concern:** The extremely negative expected return (-787.9%) raises a major red flag.

**Overall Recommendation (based SOLELY on provided data):**

Based on the data provided, a cautious approach to PepsiCo is warranted. The negative expected return and underperformance relative to the market are significant concerns. While the oversold RSI and recent short-term divergence change may present a potential buying opportunity for a short-term trade, the fundamental and performance indicators suggest a need for further research and caution before considering a long-term investment. The conflicting signals (positive MRI, negative expected return) make a definitive recommendation difficult without additional context.
