*   **PPO:** Negative PPO confirms a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** This signal advocates buying, but it contradicts the negative expected return and underperformance.
*   **Divergence Change:** A short-term increase in relative divergence suggests that PEP might be starting to outperform VOO in the very near term, but it's a small change.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return is a major red flag, indicating significant predicted underperformance against the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.
