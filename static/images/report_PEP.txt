**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While the company shows generally positive revenue and profitability, there is noticeable short-term price fluctuation.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bullish short-term outlook, but the lack of clear upward trends in EPS, the long-term underperformance relative to the S&P 500, and the missing expected values for revenue and EPS limits any confident conclusions.

The provided data suggests limited potential for long-term outperformance against the S&P 500.
