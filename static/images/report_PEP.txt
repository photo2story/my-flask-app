## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures Overview:**

PEP's cumulative return significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Recent price action shows a downward trend, and several indicators suggest a bearish sentiment.  Earnings show some volatility but generally remain strong.

**1. Performance Comparison:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a global food and beverage company producing a wide range of snacks and drinks.

* **PEP Cumulative Return:** 35.40%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 76.08%
* **Return Difference:** -40.7%
* **Relative Divergence:** 23.8% (This indicates PEP's underperformance is in the lower 23.8% of its historical range of underperformance relative to the S&P 500.)


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance against the market (Beta) and excess return over the market (Alpha) across different periods. Notably, recent years (2022-2025) show negative CAGR, highlighting market volatility's impact on PEP.  The significant negative CAGR in the most recent periods (2022-2025) is a key concern.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $140.09
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $143.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $146.31
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $147.93

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, indicating a short-term bearish trend. The recent price drop (-$1.93) reinforces this downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 34.66 (Suggests oversold conditions, but not a strong buy signal alone)
* **PPO:** -0.38 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +2.6 (Short-term upward pressure, but insignificant compared to the overall trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 1.4% (This indicates a low expected return relative to S&P 500, suggesting the market does not anticipate significant outperformance over the long term)

The negative PPO and low RSI suggest bearish sentiment. While the recent relative divergence suggests a slight short-term upward trend, this is insufficient to counteract the dominant bearish signals.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's performance lags significantly behind the S&P 500, showing a substantial negative return difference.  Technical indicators and price action suggest a bearish short-term outlook. While the company exhibits strong profit margins, recent earnings data show some volatility, and the long-term expected return is low relative to the S&P 500. The significant negative CAGR in recent years is a major concern.  Further investigation is needed to determine the causes of the Q2 2024 revenue decline and the ROE fluctuation.  Given the current data, a long-term investment in PEP requires careful consideration of its underperformance relative to the market and the need to address the identified concerns.
