**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, showing a substantial negative alpha and concerning long-term expected return.  While the company demonstrates strong revenue and profitability, the inconsistent earnings data and fluctuating ROE raise some concerns.  The negative long-term expected return (-53%) is a significant red flag and demands further investigation into the underlying assumptions of this projection.  The current price is above its moving averages suggesting a recent short-term upward trend.  However, the substantial underperformance relative to the market and the projected long-term underperformance suggest caution.  Further analysis is needed, including a deeper dive into the -53% projected long-term underperformance to justify this significant prediction.  A review of the companyâ€™s strategic positioning, competitive landscape, and macro-economic factors would help inform a more robust analysis.  The provided dataset has some inconsistencies (duplicate data entries), affecting the reliability of certain quantitative analyses.  A clean and comprehensive dataset would allow for a more accurate and insightful review.
