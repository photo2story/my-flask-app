## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  As of the last data point, PEP's cumulative return is 32.27%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 112.47%.  The difference is -80.2%, placing it at the 3.3rd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500 (-83.7% to 22.8%).  This indicates consistent underperformance compared to the broader market.

The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows fluctuating performance over the years, with periods of strong growth followed by periods of underperformance or even decline, especially recently (-27% and -28% CAGR in the last two periods).  The relatively low beta (around 0.1 consistently) suggests low correlation with overall market movements, implying that PEP's price movements are less sensitive to broader market fluctuations. However, this low beta doesn't explain the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $144.50
* **5-day Moving Average:** $145.07
* **20-day Moving Average:** $151.31
* **60-day Moving Average:** $159.56

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 32.77 - Suggests the stock is in oversold territory.
* **PPO:** -0.412 - Indicates bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +1.9 - Shows a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return:** -199.1% - This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term is highly concerning and requires further investigation.  The source and calculation method of this figure need clarification, as it is improbable.  A negative return of this magnitude implies severe underperformance over a two-year or longer time horizon.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP shows significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, despite relatively stable profit margins.  Recent price action suggests a bearish trend, supported by technical indicators (RSI and PPO). The extremely negative projected long-term return (-199.1%) needs further investigation to verify its source and validity.  The volatility in earnings and ROE indicates inconsistent performance.  Before making any investment decisions, a deeper dive into the reasons for underperformance and the accuracy of the -199.1% expected return figure is crucial.  Consider reviewing macroeconomic factors, competitive pressures within the food and beverage industry, and PEP's specific strategic initiatives to better understand its current trajectory.
