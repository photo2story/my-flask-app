**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed. While profit margins are healthy, recent revenue figures and earnings show volatility.  Technical indicators suggest a potential near-term bounce, but the overall trend appears bearish. The highly negative expected return (-529.7%) is clearly an error and requires correction.  Further investigation is needed into the reasons for the revenue and earnings volatility and the significant underperformance relative to the market.  The data inconsistencies (duplicate entry in earnings) highlight the need for careful data validation before drawing strong conclusions.  A deeper dive into the company's fundamentals and industry trends is warranted before making any investment decisions.
