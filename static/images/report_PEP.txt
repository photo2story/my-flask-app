| 2023-2025  | -19.0% | 75.0%  | -84.0% | 0.4   | 202.8   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate shows varied performance, with strong growth periods followed by more recent declines.
*   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown indicates significant potential losses in some periods. High drawdowns (e.g., 81.0%) suggest considerable volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, representing performance relative to a benchmark (likely the S&P 500), is frequently negative, suggesting underperformance compared to the benchmark. The recent values are sharply negative.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are low, indicating PEP's price is less sensitive to market movements (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization generally increased over the years but has declined in recent periods.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 148.16
*   **Previous Close:** 149.37
*   **Change:** -0.81
*   **5-day SMA:** 149.84
*   **20-day SMA:** 147.95
*   **60-day SMA:** 146.88

**Analysis:** The stock price has slightly decreased in the most recent trading session. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, and the 20-day SMA is above the 60-day SMA, which might have indicated a short-term upward trend. However, the recent price decrease could signal a weakening of this trend.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** 0.7 (Medium Investment Recommendation)
*   **RSI:** 50.36 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** 0.09 (Close to zero indicates that the moving averages are close)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 5.3 (+), indicating a short-term increase in relative performance compared to VOO.
*   **Expected Return (%):** -161.8%, suggesting a significantly negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. The RSI is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The hybrid signal recommends buying, but this contradicts the very negative expected return. The recent increase in relative divergence provides a glimmer of hope for short-term improvement. The negative expected return is a serious concern.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Lawsuit Headlines, Elliott-Backed Turnaround, 2026 Outlook, and Analyst Forecasts:** Suggests some potential challenges and opportunities, including potential activist investor influence.
*   **Has PEP Stock Been Good for Investors?** Indicates scrutiny regarding historical investor returns.
*   **Addenda Capital Inc. Has $15.41 Million Stock Holdings:** Shows continued institutional investment, but the scale is relatively modest.
*   **Should Passive-Income Investors Buy PepsiCo Stock Before 2026?:** Implies consideration for income-focused investors, possibly due to dividend yield.
*   **Organizational Changes to Accelerate Growth:** Suggests internal efforts to improve performance.
*   **Analysts Warn Shifting Consumer Trends Are Reshaping PepsiCo’s (PEP) Outlook:** Highlights external challenges impacting the company.

**Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. Organizational changes and potential for activist investor involvement could be positive. However, shifting consumer trends and scrutiny over past returns are concerning.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 2.71)
*   **Target Price:** 155.91 (avg), 172.00 (high), 115.00 (low)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** Not specified in the provided data.

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a "Hold" rating on the stock. The average target price suggests a potential upside of around 5% from the current price, but there's a wide range of opinions, as indicated by the difference between the high and low target prices.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출         |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2025-10-09 | 1.9  | 23.94 B$     |
| 2025-07-17 | 0.92 | 22.73 B$     |
| 2025-04-24 | 1.34 | 17.92 B$     |
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | 23.32 B$     |
| 2025-10-09 | 2.13 | 23.32 B$     |

**Analysis:**

*   **EPS:** Earnings Per Share have fluctuated, with the latest value at 1.9, slightly lower than the comparable quarter of the previous year (2.13).
*   **Revenue:** Revenue has also fluctuated.

The duplication of the 2024-10-08 data point is an error that makes drawing accurate conclusions difficult. It looks like the table is reporting the data for the most recent quarters in 2025 and one value from 2024 (also, the dates are inconsistent with the revenue/profitability data further below).

**6) Financial Information:**

**Analysis:** Revenue exhibits seasonal patterns, with Q4 (December 31) typically being the strongest. Profit margins have been relatively stable, fluctuating in a narrow range.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity     | ROE       |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $19.39B    | 13.43%    |
| 2025-06-30   | $18.42B    | 6.86%     |

| 2024-12-31   | $18.04B    | 8.44%     |
| 2024-09-30   | $19.45B    | 15.06%    |

**Analysis:**  Equity has remained relatively stable. ROE (Return on Equity) shows variability, indicating fluctuations in profitability relative to shareholder equity. ROE peaked in Q3 2024 and has since declined.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

*   **Underperformance:** PepsiCo has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, with a substantial negative divergence in cumulative returns and negative alpha values.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators provide conflicting signals. The MRI suggests medium investment risk, while the hybrid signal recommends buying, but the expected return is very negative.
*   **Analyst Uncertainty:** Analysts have a Hold rating with a wide range of target prices, indicating uncertainty about the stock's future performance.
*   **Financial Health:** The company appears financially stable, but recent performance indicates a potential need for improvement.
*   **News Concerns:** News headlines highlight both opportunities (organizational changes, potential activist involvement) and challenges (shifting consumer trends, scrutiny over past returns).
*   **Key Concern:** The drastically negative expected return (-161.8%) is a major red flag and suggests significant risks associated with a long-term investment in PEP at the current time.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, an investment in PepsiCo appears risky at this time. The significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, combined with negative expected returns, should give investors pause. While some positive aspects exist (stable financial health, potential for activist investor influence), the overall picture suggests caution. Further research and monitoring of PepsiCo's progress in addressing its challenges are warranted before considering a long-term investment. A further look at why Alpha has been so low in recent years would be prudent.
