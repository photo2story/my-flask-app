2024-11-29 - Analysis Report
## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The cumulative return of PEP (53.75%) significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (128.86%) over the analyzed period. The difference is -75.1%, placing it at the 2.4th percentile of its historical range of divergence (max: 22.9%, min: -77.5%).  This indicates PEP's underperformance relative to the broader market.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows a Beta consistently around 1.1, suggesting PEP's price movements are slightly more volatile than the market.  Alpha values generally hover around 1.0, implying slightly above-market returns in some periods, but these are inconsistent and not sufficient to offset the overall underperformance versus VOO.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $162.72
* **5-day Moving Average:** $162.05
* **20-day Moving Average:** $163.04
* **60-day Moving Average:** $169.67

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (46.64):** Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.  However, this should be considered in conjunction with other factors.
* **PPO (0.22):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although it's relatively low.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+2.4):** Shows short-term upward momentum relative to the S&P 500, but this is weak given the substantial overall underperformance.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided 0.0% expected return suggests that, based on available data, long-term (2+ years) investment in PEP is not anticipated to significantly outperform the S&P 500.  The considerable underperformance to date supports this.  The $162.72 closing price doesn't signal a sudden price spike or drop (neither extreme volatility).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals some inconsistencies and requires clarification (duplicate entry for 2024-10-08).  Assuming the duplicate is an error, and focusing only on unique entries:

* **Revenue:** Revenue fluctuates but shows a general upward trend, except for a notable dip in Q1 2024.
* **EPS:** EPS also fluctuates, showing some decline in Q1 2024 compared to Q4 2023.  There is no consistent pattern.
* **Beats/Misses:**  Without expectations data, it's impossible to determine whether these results exceeded or fell short of analysts' forecasts.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue & Profitability:**  Revenue shows some seasonality. Profit margins generally remain high and relatively stable, though slightly decreasing recently.
* **Capital & Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable.  ROE fluctuates significantly, indicating variability in profitability.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or analyst opinions are provided in the initial prompt.  More information is needed here to adequately assess current market sentiment and analyst perspectives on PEP.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, showing a considerable negative divergence.  While some technical indicators hint at potential short-term upside (RSI nearing oversold, positive PPO), the overall trend is bearish based on the price action relative to moving averages.  Earnings show some volatility but no clear alarming trends without more context and comparative data.  The low expected return suggests that outperforming the market with PEP requires a significant shift in its performance. Further investigation into recent news, analyst opinions, and comparison to expected earnings is needed for a more comprehensive assessment.
