**1) Return Rate vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** PepsiCo Inc. is a global food and beverage company.
*   **PEP Cumulative Return:** 20.54%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 100.88%

**Analysis:**

The relative divergence of 6.4 suggests this underperformance is near its worst level historically, implying potential for future catch-up, but no guarantees.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR  | MDD   | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 25.0% | 12.4% | -3.0% | 0.1  | 162.9  |
| 2016-2018  | 8.0%  | 64.1% | -7.0% | 0.0  | 150.1  |
| 2017-2019  | 27.0% | 64.1% | 4.0%  | 0.4  | 185.7  |
| 2018-2020  | 19.0% | 81.0% | -5.0% | 0.4  | 201.5  |
| 2019-2021  | 40.0% | 81.0% | -7.0% | 0.6  | 236.0  |
| 2020-2022  | 5.0%  | 81.0% | 6.0%  | 0.5  | 245.5  |
| 2021-2023  | 9.0%  | 79.7% | 8.0%  | 0.4  | 230.8  |
| 2022-2024  | -28.0%| 73.0% | -49.0%| 0.3  | 206.6  |
| 2023-2025  | -19.0%| 75.0% | -84.0%| 0.4  | 201.3  |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuates significantly, indicating variable growth periods.  Recent years (2022-2025) show negative CAGR.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high, especially in recent periods, suggesting significant price volatility and potential for loss.  MDD appears exceptionally high, which is unusual for a stable company like Pepsi.  This warrants investigation into the data source.
*   **Alpha:**  Generally negative, indicating underperformance relative to its benchmark (likely the S&P 500). The large negative alpha in the last two periods is concerning.
*   **Beta:** Relatively low (around 0.3-0.6), suggesting lower volatility than the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in billions of dollars.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Close:** 148.16
*   **Last Market:** Price = 147.05, Previous Close = 148.16, Change = -0.75
*   **5-day SMA:** 149.84
*   **20-day SMA:** 147.95
*   **60-day SMA:** 146.88

**Analysis:**

*   The current price (147.05) is below the 5-day SMA (149.84), suggesting a recent downtrend.
*   The 20-day SMA (147.95) is slightly above the 60-day SMA (146.88), suggesting a potential longer-term uptrend, but the 5-day being above both complicates the picture. Overall, recent price action suggests a mild downtrend.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 50.36 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.09 (Positive, suggesting slight upward momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** -2.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -241.5% (Very Negative)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
*   The neutral RSI indicates no strong momentum in either direction.
*   The slightly positive PPO hints at some upward momentum, but it is not strong.
*   The Hybrid Signal suggests a buy recommendation, but this conflicts with the highly negative expected return.  This conflict needs further investigation. The Hybrid Signal is labelled "Very Safe," which seems questionable given the rest of the data.
*   The negative divergence change confirms the recent downtrend.
*   The **extremely negative expected return (-241.5%) is a major red flag.**  It indicates a strong expectation of significant losses if investing from this point. This must be carefully scrutinized as it could be an error or an indicator of serious problems.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Exchange Traded Concepts LLC Lowers Stock Position:** Indicates some institutional investors are reducing their stake.
*   **Chip Stock Recommendation:** Irrelevant to PepsiCo.
*   **Protein and Prebiotic Push:** Suggests PepsiCo is innovating in health-conscious areas.
*   **Lawsuit Headlines, Elliott-Backed Turnaround, 2026 Outlook:** Indicates potential challenges (lawsuit) and possible activist investor involvement (Elliott), along with future outlook discussions.
*   **PepsiCo (PEP) Stock in 2026 - What to Watch:** Signals forward-looking analysis and potential key areas of focus for investors.
*   **Matrix Asset Advisors Inc. NY Sells Shares:** Another instance of institutional selling.

**Analysis:**

The news is mixed.  The institutional selling is a negative signal. The protein and prebiotic push is positive, indicating innovation.  The lawsuit and turnaround suggest potential uncertainty and possible restructuring.  The focus on 2026 indicates investors are looking ahead to see if the company can improve its performance.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (2.71)
*   **Target Price:** 155.91 (Average)

**Analysis:**

Analysts, on average, have a "Hold" rating on PepsiCo. The average target price (155.91) is slightly above the current price (around 147), suggesting potential upside, but it is not a strong buy signal.  The lack of recent rating changes indicates no strong recent shift in analyst sentiment.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

Overall, the analysis paints a mixed picture for PepsiCo:

*   **Underperformance:** PepsiCo has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the recent relative divergence suggests this is near its historical worst.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The **extremely negative expected return (-241.5%) is highly concerning and requires validation and further investigation.** This is a major red flag.
*   **Mixed Signals:** Technical indicators provide mixed signals. The Hybrid Signal suggests a buy, but this conflicts strongly with the expected return.
*   **Institutional Selling:** Recent news reveals institutional investors are reducing their positions, which is a negative signal.
*   **Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts have a "Hold" rating, suggesting no strong conviction.
*   **Solid Fundamentals:** Revenue and profit margins are generally strong, though ROE has fluctuated.
*   **High MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is unusually high which could be an indicator of high volatility or a data error.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this data, I would be **very cautious** about investing in PepsiCo at this time. The negative expected return and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 are serious concerns. The conflicting signals from the technical indicators and the institutional selling further strengthen the negative outlook.  The high MDD could suggest some sort of volatility or even data issues.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Verify the Expected Return:**  Double-check the calculation and data sources for the extremely negative expected return. This value is critical to understand.
2.  **Investigate MDD Data:** The very high MDD data is unusual for a well established company. Verify the data sources and look into the causes of any drawdown of more than 60% (as seen in the data set).
3.  **Further Research:** Conduct further research to understand the reasons behind the institutional selling and the potential lawsuit mentioned in the news.
4.  **Monitor the Turnaround:** Pay close attention to any news regarding the potential turnaround efforts, especially if Elliott Management becomes involved.
5.  **Wait and See:** Unless there are significant positive developments, it may be best to wait and see how the situation unfolds before making an investment decision.
