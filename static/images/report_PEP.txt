## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The cumulative return for PEP is 34.11%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 116.43%.  The difference is -82.3%, placing it at the 1.7th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500. This indicates PEP's considerable underperformance compared to the broader market.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows that PEP's alpha consistently remains around 0.1, suggesting a slightly positive return relative to the market benchmark over various periods. However, the beta is consistently near 1 across all years, implying it exhibits similar volatility to the overall market. This doesn't explain the considerable underperformance noted above.  Further investigation into specific market factors affecting PEP during each period is needed.  The high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values in recent years (e.g., -48% and -101%) are particularly concerning and warrant attention. The negative CAGR in 2022-2025 is alarming.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $146.51
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $144.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $149.47
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $158.16

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a possible downtrend. The distance from the 60-day MA is significant, hinting at a more substantial correction.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 32.73 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound. However, the negative PPO and MDD values should be considered.
* **PPO:** -0.082 – Negative PPO shows weakening momentum.
* **Relative Strength Divergence:** -0.6 – Indicates a recent downward trend.

The expected return of -400.9% is extremely negative and unrealistic. This likely represents a calculation error or a misleading metric. It's crucial to revise this calculation. The statement "if 146.51 is large" is unclear and needs clarification.  Given the low RSI and negative momentum, a sharp rebound seems unlikely without significant market shifts or positive company-specific news.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility.  While revenue generally remained relatively stable or increased, EPS fluctuated significantly, particularly showing a considerable decline in Q1 2024.  Further analysis is required to determine the causes of these EPS fluctuations.  There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-10-08.  Data cleaning is needed before drawing definitive conclusions.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | 23.32        |
| 2024-07-11 | 2.24 | 22.50        |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.49 | 18.25        |
| 2023-10-10 | 2.25 | 23.45        |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has remained relatively stable in the past year. Profit margins have been consistent above 50%, suggesting healthy profitability. However, the equity fluctuates, and ROE indicates periods of strong and weak profitability. More context and analysis are needed to determine whether this is a cyclical issue, a structural shift, or related to external economic conditions.  The 2023-12-31 ROE of 7.04% is a significant drop.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce, the negative PPO, high MDD, and negative CAGR indicate underlying concerns.  The recent earnings data highlights EPS volatility and requires further analysis to identify contributing factors. The financial information shows a generally healthy profit margin but inconsistent ROE.  Overall, further investigation is required to understand the causes of PEP's underperformance.  The alarmingly high negative expected return should be thoroughly investigated and corrected.  Before recommending any investment strategy (especially long-term), a deeper dive into the company's fundamentals, macroeconomic factors affecting the industry, and competitor analysis is warranted.  The high MDD values warrant close attention to risk management strategies.
