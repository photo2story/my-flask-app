## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures at a Glance:**

* **Cumulative Return (PEP):** 35.76%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 76.18%
* **Return Difference (PEP vs. VOO):** -40.4%

**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

PepsiCo Inc. is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  Over the period reviewed, PEP significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), lagging by 40.4 percentage points. While this suggests underperformance, the relative divergence of 24.1% indicates this underperformance is not exceptionally unusual within the historical context of the two assets' relative performances.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different periods.  While alpha is generally positive or near zero indicating periods where PEP outperformed or matched the market after accounting for risk, it's important to note that the most recent period (2023-2025) shows a significant negative CAGR and a high MDD (Maximum Drawdown), which is concerning. Beta generally hovers around 0.3-0.4, suggesting relatively lower sensitivity to market movements than the overall market.  However, more context around the data (e.g., risk-free rate) is needed to fully interpret these values.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 31.0% | 2.3% | -2.0% | 0.0 | 132.7 |
| 2016-2018  | 15.0% | 62.1% | -6.0% | 0.0 | 126.3 |
| 2017-2019  | 39.0% | 62.1% | 5.0% | 0.5 | 160.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 41.0% | 62.1% | 11.0% | 0.4 | 179.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 63.0% | 61.1% | 3.0% | 0.3 | 216.6 |
| 2020-2022  | 17.0% | 61.1% | 8.0% | 0.3 | 231.3 |
| 2021-2023  | 15.0% | 61.6% | -6.0% | 0.4 | 223.7 |
| 2022-2024  | -39.0% | 61.6% | -59.0% | 0.3 | 206.7 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $142.84
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $143.39
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $146.10
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $147.86

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The recent price increase of $1.96 compared to the previous close suggests a potential short-term bounce back, but further observation is necessary to confirm.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 40.42 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** -0.32 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** 1.8 (+), indicating a recent short-term upward movement.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** 1.2% This is a long-term, relative S&P 500 outperformance prediction. It is important to note that this prediction might not be accurate.


The combination of RSI near oversold levels and the positive relative strength change suggests a potential short-term price rebound. However, the negative PPO and the fact that the price is below its moving averages indicates bearish momentum. The MRI suggests a medium risk level, requiring further due diligence.  The relatively small price increase needs to be viewed within the context of market volatility to assess its significance.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility. Revenue has been relatively consistent, while EPS fluctuates notably, indicating potential inconsistency in profitability. There appears to be a duplicate entry for Oct 8, 2024.  Further investigation is needed to clarify the discrepancy.

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출         |
|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | $23.32B       |
| 2024-07-11 | 2.24 | $22.50B       |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.49 | $18.25B       |
| 2023-10-10 | 2.25 | $23.45B       |
| 2024-10-08 | 2.25 | $23.45B       |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability show relatively healthy figures.  Profit margins are consistently high, demonstrating strong operational efficiency. However, there is some volatility in the Equity and ROE figures, suggesting potential changes in the company's financial structure or operational performance.  Further analysis would be needed to determine the causes of these fluctuations.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $27.78B   | 52.56%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $23.32B   | 55.42%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $22.50B   | 55.92%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $18.25B   | 54.81%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $27.85B   | 52.97%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE    |
|---------|------------|--------|
| 2024-12-31 | $18.04B   | 8.44%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $19.45B   | 15.06% |
| 2024-06-30 | $19.45B   | 15.85% |
| 2024-03-31 | $19.05B   | 10.72% |
| 2023-12-31 | $18.50B   | 7.04%  |


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, showing a significant negative return difference. While financial statements indicate healthy revenue and profit margins, there is volatility in EPS and ROE.  Technical indicators suggest a potential short-term bounce, but the longer-term outlook is uncertain, particularly considering the negative CAGR in the most recent periods. The long-term expected return of 1.2% against the S&P 500 needs further validation and may be subject to significant variation depending on market conditions. Further investigation into the inconsistencies within the provided data (duplicate earnings data) and a deeper dive into macroeconomic factors affecting the company are recommended before making any investment decisions.
