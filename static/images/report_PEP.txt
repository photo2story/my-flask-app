## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The provided data shows PEP's cumulative return at 37.49% significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) at 113.65%. The difference is -76.2%, placing it at the 4.4th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500's range (-80.8% to 22.8%).  This indicates underperformance relative to the broader market.  The alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting slight outperformance above the market benchmark (beta of approximately 1), though this is contradicted by the significant cumulative return difference.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values in recent years indicate significant periods of underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $150.21
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $151.86
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $155.15
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $162.21

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (32.09):** Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.115):**  Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (+4.4):** Shows short-term upward momentum relative to the S&P 500, although this is inconsistent with the overall trend.
* **Expected Return (-143.4%):** This extremely negative figure suggests a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  This result needs further investigation as such a high negative return is unusual.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows inconsistencies and potential errors.  Specifically, 2024-10-08 has two entries with different EPS values. Assuming only one entry is correct, there is:

* **EPS Trends:**  Inconsistent quarter-to-quarter, with no clear upward or downward trend.  There is a significant drop in EPS from Q2 2024 to Q1 2024.
* **Revenue Growth Trends:** Revenue shows some fluctuation, but not a clear consistent upward trend.  There's a noticeable drop in Q1 2024 revenue.
* **Comparison to Prior Quarters:** There's significant volatility in both EPS and Revenue, without an easily identifiable pattern.  Inconsistencies require clarification for meaningful analysis.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates; profit margins are relatively stable but show a slight decline over the last year.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity remains relatively stable, ROE shows substantial volatility, suggesting inconsistent profitability and challenges in maintaining return on investment.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Recent Earnings News (within last 2 days):** Not provided.
* **Recent Market Outlook:** Not provided.
* **Analyst Opinions and Performance Highlights:** Not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  Technical indicators suggest potential short-term upside, but the overall trend is bearish, supported by the negative expected return (though this number requires further review as it's unusually high).  Earnings data shows inconsistency and needs clarification to provide a comprehensive analysis. The high maximum drawdown figures indicate substantial risk.  The large discrepancy between the reported long-term expected return and short-term indicators warrants a thorough investigation of the data sources and calculation methodology. Further information regarding recent news, analyst opinions, and market outlook is essential for a complete assessment.


**8. Recommendations:**

Given the current data,  a deeper investigation is necessary before making any investment decisions.  Inconsistencies in the financial data require clarification.  It is crucial to obtain up-to-date news, analyst reports, and a more thorough explanation of the -143.4% expected return calculation.  The current data does not support a positive outlook for PEP relative to the S&P 500.
