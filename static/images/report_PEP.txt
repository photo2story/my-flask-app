**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

PepsiCo (PEP) appears to be facing challenges. It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and recent news headlines reflect some concerns. The stock is currently in a short-term downward trend, as indicated by the moving averages. The RSI suggests it may be oversold, which *could* signal a potential rebound. However, the negative Alpha values and the extremely negative expected return are significant red flags. While analyst consensus is a "Hold," the target price range is wide, reflecting uncertainty. The recent decrease in equity and volatile ROE may also contribute to investor hesitancy.

**In summary:** While the oversold RSI and "Hold" rating offer some potential hope, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, negative news sentiment, and negative expected return suggest caution is warranted. Further investigation into the reasons behind the negative Alpha and long-term expected return is essential before making any investment decisions. Investors should carefully weigh the potential risks and rewards before considering PEP.
