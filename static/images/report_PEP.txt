**1) Return Rate Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

*   **Company Overview:** PepsiCo Inc. is a global food and beverage company.
*   **Return Rate Comparison:**
    *   PEP Cumulative Return: 11.61%
    *   VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return: 91.00%
    *   Divergence: -78.7 (Relative Divergence: 2.8)

    **Analysis:** PepsiCo has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period. The divergence of -78.7% means that PepsiCo's returns lagged substantially.

*   **Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR    | MDD   | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|---------|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| 2016-2018  | 5.0%    | 11.7% | 2.0%    | 0.5    | 151.3  |
| 2017-2019  | 25.0%   | 11.7% | 8.0%    | 0.5    | 187.1  |
| 2018-2020  | 18.0%   | 11.7% | -3.0%   | 0.8    | 203.0  |
| 2019-2021  | 37.0%   | 9.0%  | -6.0%   | 0.8    | 237.8  |
| 2020-2022  | 4.0%    | 13.5% | 6.0%    | 0.7    | 247.3  |
| 2021-2023  | 9.0%    | 14.5% | 8.0%    | 0.5    | 232.5  |
| 2022-2024  | -27.0%  | 15.6% | -47.0%  | 0.4    | 208.2  |
| 2023-2025  | -20.0%  | 19.7% | -82.0%  | 0.2    | 196.5  |

    **Analysis:**

    *   **CAGR:** The Compounded Average Growth Rate shows periods of strong growth (e.g., 2019-2021) followed by recent negative growth (2022-2025).
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during each period, showing increasing volatility.
    *   **Alpha:**  Alpha measures the investment's performance relative to the market (S&P 500) taking into account the risk (beta).  Negative Alpha in recent periods (2018-2021, 2022-2025, 2023-2025) indicates underperformance compared to the S&P 500 on a risk-adjusted basis. The recent figures (-47% and -82%) are concerning.
    *   **Beta:** Beta measures the stock's volatility compared to the market. A Beta consistently below 1 (0.2-0.8) suggests PEP is less volatile than the S&P 500. However, this also means it may not capture as much upside during bull markets.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market Capitalization in Billions. Shows a general increase then a decline.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   Close: 142.23
*   Previous Close: 143.52
*   Change: -0.9
*   5-day SMA: 143.586
*   20-day SMA: 146.6595
*   60-day SMA: 147.2958

    **Analysis:** The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This suggests a short-term downtrend. The last day's price decrease implies continued negative momentum.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   Market Risk Indicator (MRI): 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   RSI: 22.29
*   PPO: -0.4531
*   Hybrid Signal: cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   Recent (20 days) relative divergence change = 1.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   Expected Return (%): -581.0

    **Analysis:**

    *   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk.
    *   **RSI:**  An RSI of 22.29 indicates that the stock is oversold.  This often suggests a potential for a price rebound, but should be considered with other indicators.
    *   **PPO:** A negative PPO (-0.4531) suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, confirming the downtrend.
    *   **Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy 100% of cash" signal, coupled with "Very Safe" and a high MRI of 0.9, contradicts the other data. This signal should be heavily scrutinized and potentially disregarded, as it doesn't align with the negative returns and other bearish indicators.
    *   **Recent relative divergence change:** Although this indicates a short-term rise, the overall divergence is still significantly negative.
    *   **Expected Return:** A very negative expected return (-581.0%) is extremely concerning.  This suggests that, based on the model, a long-term investment from this point is projected to significantly underperform the S&P 500.  This is the most critical red flag.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Negative Sentiment:** The news headlines point towards a mixed to negative sentiment surrounding PepsiCo. Concerns about upcoming earnings, U.S. data, and a stock sale by an investment firm are present.
*   **Analyst Activity:** The Barclays price target lift is a positive signal, but needs to be weighed against other negative news.
*   **Contradictory Signals:** Some articles suggest potential upside (e.g., dividend streak, surprising stock pick), while others highlight potential challenges.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Analyst Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean:** 2.71
*   **Opinions:** 22
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 155.91 / 172.00 / 115.00

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is "Hold", suggesting a neutral outlook. The average target price suggests a moderate potential upside from the current price. The wide range between the high and low target prices indicates uncertainty among analysts.

*   **Downtrend:**  The stock is in a short-term downtrend, trading below its key moving averages.
*   **Oversold:** The RSI indicates the stock is oversold, potentially signaling a short-term bounce.
*   **Negative Outlook:** The overwhelmingly negative "Expected Return" is a major red flag.
*   **Mixed Sentiment:** News headlines and analyst opinions present a mixed picture, but with an emphasis on a Hold rating.
*   **Solid Fundamentals:** PepsiCo maintains strong profit margins and generally stable equity, but ROE fluctuates.
*   **Questionable Hybrid Signal:** The "Buy" signal from the Hybrid Signal appears to be an outlier and should be investigated.

**Overall Recommendation:**

The data suggests caution. While the oversold RSI might present a short-term trading opportunity, the deep underperformance compared to the S&P 500, the negative expected return, and recent negative Alpha figures raise serious concerns about PepsiCo's future performance. It would be prudent to investigate the reasons for the negative expected return, to do further due diligence, and to compare PEP with its peers. Unless some of these red flags are addressed, it would be difficult to recommend a long position in PEP at this time.
