PepsiCo (PEP) has shown significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the period analyzed.

The large fluctuations in MDD in the recent years also points to a need for further risk assessment.  Further investigation into the reasons for the underperformance and the unusually high MDD values in recent years is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A deeper dive into industry trends, competitor analysis, and macroeconomic factors would enhance the understanding of PEP's current situation and future outlook.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data also needs clarification.
