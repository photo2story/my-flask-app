## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 30.57% for PEP, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.20%.  The difference is -81.6%, placing it at the 2nd percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500.  This indicates PEP's underperformance relative to the broader market over the period analyzed. The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data shows significant variability in performance across different periods, ranging from substantial gains to considerable losses in recent years, suggesting market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $142.64
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $146.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $151.92
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $160.06

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 22.36  (Indicates oversold conditions)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.46 (Suggests bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -2.5% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -333.6% (This extremely negative figure warrants further investigation; it likely represents a significant error or misunderstanding in the calculation methodology.  The negative sign confirms the underperformance relative to the S&P 500.)

The low RSI suggests the stock might be oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity, but the negative PPO and the strong downward trend counteract this. The extremely negative expected return is a major concern and needs clarification.  A 142.64 closing price is not significantly different from the moving averages to suggest a sudden, large price shift (like a sudden jump or drop).
