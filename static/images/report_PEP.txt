**1. Performance Comparison & Company Overview:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  PEP's cumulative return of 34.77% significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) with a return of 82.57%, resulting in a difference of -47.8%.  The relative divergence of 16.1% suggests that this underperformance is within the historical range of variability between the two, but still notably lower.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed results across different periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others show negative alpha, and the Beta generally hovers around 0.3-0.4, implying moderate market sensitivity.  The CAGR is also highly variable between time periods, which could reflect the cyclical nature of the consumer staples sector and the impact of economic conditions.  The maximum drawdown (MDD) also varies across the years, reaching significantly high values in recent periods (-59%), indicating substantial risk.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 31.0% | 2.3% | -2.0% | 0.0 | 132.7 |
| 2016-2018  | 15.0% | 62.1% | -6.0% | 0.0 | 126.3 |
| 2017-2019  | 39.0% | 62.1% | 5.0% | 0.5 | 160.9 |
| 2018-2020  | 41.0% | 62.1% | 11.0% | 0.4 | 179.7 |

| 2020-2022  | 17.0% | 61.1% | 8.0% | 0.3 | 231.3 |
| 2021-2023  | 15.0% | 61.6% | -6.0% | 0.4 | 223.7 |
| 2022-2024  | -39.0% | 61.6% | -59.0% | 0.3 | 206.7 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $135.31
* **Last Market Price:** $133.75
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $141.12
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $144.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $147.28

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent small price increase ($0.15) is not substantial enough to indicate a significant reversal.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 30.33 (Oversold, potential bounce but not guaranteed)
* **PPO:** -0.44 (Negative momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -7.7% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** 0.6% (This is a very low expected return and significantly lower than a typical S&P 500 return. This indicates that the expected return will need to substantially increase before an investment recommendation would be viable. It is recommended that the investor investigate the expected return further.)

The MRI suggests a medium risk level.  The RSI indicates the stock may be oversold, suggesting a potential bounce, but the PPO confirms the negative momentum and the small recent price increase is insufficient to suggest an immediate upward reversal of trend. The low expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a cause for concern.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-04-24 | 1.34 | $17.92B     |

| 2025-04-24 | 1.49 | $18.25B     |

Earnings show some volatility.  There's a noticeable drop in both EPS and revenue in the most recent quarter reported (2025-04-24) compared to the previous quarters. This requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.  The repetition of data for 2025-04-24 needs clarification – it’s possible this is a data entry error.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP currently underperforms VOO significantly. While the company shows relatively stable profit margins and high revenue in some quarters, recent earnings show a notable decline.  Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but negative momentum persists. The low expected return compared to VOO is a serious concern.  The large MDD figures highlight the risk associated with this stock.  Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for the recent earnings decline and to assess the long-term prospects of the company before making any investment decisions.  The data inconsistencies (repeated data entry for 2025-04-24) also require clarification.
