**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Overall, the analysis presents a mixed picture for PepsiCo.**
*   **Negative Signals:** Significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500, high MDD, and a *very* negative expected return that raises serious concerns. The negative alpha values over several recent periods indicate a failure to outperform based on risk-adjusted expectations. News about potential regulatory scrutiny is also a concern.
*   **Positive Signals:** Recent short-term upward price movement, medium MRI, analyst price target increases. The consistently low Beta offers some protection against overall market downturns.
*   **Neutral Signals:** Analyst consensus "Hold," fluctuating revenue and profitability.
*   **Key Takeaway:** The extremely negative expected return is a significant red flag and needs further investigation. The underperformance compared to the S&P 500 is also concerning. While there are some positive signs, the negative aspects outweigh them.

**Recommendation:**

Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is warranted. The negative expected return and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 are strong reasons to avoid investing in PepsiCo at this time. Further research into the reasons for the extremely negative expected return is crucial before making any investment decision. The analyst upgrades are encouraging but need to be weighed against the broader negative indicators.
