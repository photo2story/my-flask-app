* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** +2.78 (Indicates short-term upward momentum)

**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided financial data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue.  While some quarters exhibit strong revenue and EPS figures, others show a decrease.  Note that the data includes a duplicate entry for October 8th, 2024. The absence of estimated figures for the most recent quarter makes it hard to compare it with actuals.  A comprehensive analysis requires access to the actual earnings reports to assess against expectations.

**6. Financial Ratios:**

The provided data on Revenue, Profitability, Equity, and ROE indicates a generally healthy financial picture for PepsiCo.  Profit margins are consistently high (above 50%), suggesting strong profitability.  ROE fluctuates, which is expected given the cyclicality of the consumer goods sector.

*(This section requires access to real-time news sources like Shacknews, Finbold, etc.  Please provide recent news articles or summaries for a complete analysis.

**8. Summary:**

PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period, despite exhibiting relatively stable financials. While some technical indicators suggest potential short-term upward momentum, the overall outlook remains neutral to slightly bearish, primarily due to the lower-than-market returns, low expected returns (relative to S&P 500), and uncertainty surrounding the future performance.  The significant gap between PEP's performance and the S&P 500's return calls for a thorough examination of market-specific factors and company-specific challenges.  The lack of specific earnings expectations makes thorough analysis of current performance impossible. Additional data, including recent news and analyst sentiment, is crucial to paint a more complete picture.
