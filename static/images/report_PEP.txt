## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  Over the review period, PEP's cumulative return (36.49%) lagged behind the S&P 500's return (52.12%).  The difference is -15.6%, placing it at the 1.1 percentile of its historical relative performance range (-16.6% to 71.5%).  While PEP's performance was below that of the broader market in this specific period, the provided alpha values (around 1.0) suggest that it tends to match market movements with potentially some periods of outperformance in the past.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha and beta values are inconsistent and require further clarification. All alpha values are 1.0 suggesting neutral outperformance. The beta values and varying CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) indicate fluctuating market sensitivity across the different time periods.  The negative CAGR values in the later periods suggest underperformance during those specific years. Further investigation into the methodology used to calculate alpha and beta is needed.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $149.12
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $148.53
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $148.30
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $156.23

The price is slightly above the short-term moving averages (5 and 20-day) but significantly below the 60-day moving average.  This suggests a recent price decline after a potential prior uptrend.  The small positive change from the previous close ($0.34) indicates a minor recent price increase, not a significant reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 46.90 - Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, leaning slightly towards bearish territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.49 - A positive value indicates that the short-term momentum is stronger than the long-term momentum.  However, a further interpretation would need the specific time frame of the PPO.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** -1.0 - Indicates a recent downward trend in relative performance compared to the market.
* **Expected Return:** 4079.1% - This exceptionally high expected return requires significant clarification.  The timeframe and methodology for this calculation are crucial for a valid interpretation. Without details on the calculation, this figure is unreliable.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some variability in EPS and revenue.  While Q4 2023 and Q1 2024 showed strong EPS and Revenue, the following quarters show a decrease in both.  A more in-depth analysis would require consideration of seasonality, industry trends, and any external factors impacting PepsiCo's performance. Note that there is duplicated data for 2024-10-08.


| Date       | EPS  | Revenue (B$) |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | 23.32        |
| 2024-07-11 | 2.24 | 22.50        |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.49 | 18.25        |
| 2023-10-10 | 2.25 | 23.45        |


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial data shows relatively stable revenue with some fluctuation. Profit margins have remained fairly consistent, suggesting efficient operations.  Equity has shown a modest increase, and ROE (Return on Equity) varies, indicating fluctuating profitability.  A deeper dive into the financial statements is needed to assess the long-term financial health and stability of the company.

| Quarter    | Revenue (B$) | Profit Margin (%) | Equity (B$) | ROE (%) |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| 2024-09-30 | 23.32          | 55.42            | 19.45          | 15.06   |
| 2024-06-30 | 22.50          | 55.92            | 19.45          | 15.85   |
| 2024-03-31 | 18.25          | 54.81            | 19.05          | 10.72   |
| 2023-12-31 | 27.85          | 52.97            | 18.50          | 7.04    |
| 2023-09-30 | 23.45          | 54.48            | 18.81          | 16.44   |


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's recent performance has lagged the S&P 500. While the company shows consistent profitability and relatively stable revenue, recent earnings show some decline.  Technical indicators provide a mixed signal. The exceptionally high projected return figure lacks transparency and should be disregarded until properly explained. Further analysis, including a review of the methodology for calculating alpha and beta, and a more thorough examination of the financial statements and market conditions is necessary to formulate a complete investment recommendation. The inconsistent and potentially erroneous data presented requires further investigation.  The data provided is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions about PEP's investment potential.
