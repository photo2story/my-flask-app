## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**0) Summary Statistics:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a global food and beverage company producing a wide range of snacks, drinks, and other food products.  The analysis below uses provided data to assess PEP's performance relative to the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PEP's cumulative return is significantly lower than VOO's (35.69% vs 78.93%). This places it at the 21.1th percentile of its historical range relative to VOO (-43.2% from the peak difference).  The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals mixed results. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates considerably from year to year, often exceeding VOO's implied return, the alpha (excess return relative to the market) is generally low and sometimes negative. The beta (volatility relative to the market) remains relatively stable around 0.3-0.4, indicating lower volatility than the broader market.  The substantial negative CAGR in 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 is a key concern.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) generally shows growth, however.

**2) Recent Price Movements:**

PEP's closing price is $142.26.  The price has recently decreased ($-0.84 from the previous close).  Moving averages suggest a downward trend: the 5-day MA (142.08) is below the 20-day MA (145.60) and 60-day MA (147.51).

**3) Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4174 (Medium Risk) suggests moderate market volatility.
* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 40.50 indicates the stock is approaching oversold territory.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.166 signifies a bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:**  A negative change of -0.4 reflects a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return:** A 0.7% expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is relatively low and might not compensate for the added risk. The recent price drop (-$0.84) shows a slight downward trend but does not indicate a significant sell-off.

**6) Overall Conclusion:**

PEP shows strong revenue and profitability, but its stock performance lags behind the S&P 500 significantly.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish short-term trend. While the long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 is positive, it's modest.  The significant negative returns in the 2022-2025 CAGR forecasts are concerning.  Further investigation is needed to understand the causes of the recent underperformance and the duplicated earnings data.  A more in-depth analysis of the company's competitive landscape, growth prospects, and risk factors would be necessary before making any investment decision.  Investors should consider these factors alongside their own risk tolerance and investment goals.
