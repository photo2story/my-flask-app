## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

This report analyzes PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), a global food and beverage company producing a wide range of snacks, drinks, and other food products.

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo's cumulative return of 54.44% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's 130.06% over the analyzed period.  The provided data shows a -75.6% divergence from the S&P 500, placing it in the 1.9th percentile of its historical range of divergence (from -77.5% to 22.9%).  While the alpha is consistently around 0.1, indicating slight outperformance compared to the market, the beta of around 0.1 suggests low correlation with the S&P 500's movements.  This, combined with the significant underperformance, suggests a strategy that's not necessarily benefiting from market trends.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $163.45
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $162.68
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $162.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $169.43

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a bearish trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 45.56 (Slightly below neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.30 (Positive, suggesting a bullish momentum, although weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** NaN (-)  This is missing data and can't be evaluated. The absence of this data prevents a complete evaluation of the divergence.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (The provided expected return is 0%, meaning no significant outperformance is expected over the S&P 500 in the long term. This contradicts the alpha which shows slight outperformance. This conflict needs further investigation using a more comprehensive model.)

The provided data lacks crucial details to confidently evaluate the potential for a substantial price increase or decrease given the closing price.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals some inconsistencies:  The 2024-10-08 entry is duplicated.  Ignoring the duplicate entry, we can observe:

* **Quarterly Revenue:** Shows some volatility, with a significant drop in Q1 2024, followed by recovery in subsequent quarters. However, a year-over-year decline can be noted from Q4 2023 to Q3 2024.
* **EPS:** Fluctuations are observed, with a notable drop from Q2 2024 to Q1 2024.  EPS for Q3 2024 is quite similar to Q4 2023.
* **Overall:** Without further context (like analyst expectations), it's challenging to definitively determine if the results beat or missed expectations. However, there is noticeable revenue variability and EPS fluctuations that require further analysis for accurate assessment.

**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:** Demonstrates seasonality and fluctuation.  Year over year, revenue for Q3 2024 has slightly decreased compared to Q3 2023.
* **Profit Margin:** Relatively stable and high, hovering around 55%, though it showed a decrease in Q4 2023.
* **Equity & ROE:**  Equity has shown consistent growth, though ROE fluctuates, highlighting potential operational inefficiencies or one-time events impacting profitability.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires the input of any recent news concerning PepsiCo and market outlook from recent sources to provide a complete assessment.  The lack of information on analyst opinions or performance highlights hampers the review's completeness.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PepsiCo's recent performance has lagged the S&P 500 considerably, raising concerns. Although the alpha suggests slightly better performance than the market in some periods, the substantial underperformance in the cumulative returns and negative divergence from the S&P 500 raise concerns.  Technical indicators provide a mixed signal, not clearly indicating an overbought or oversold condition. Earnings data reveals fluctuations in revenue and EPS, requiring further investigation into whether these fluctuations are normal seasonality or indicators of deeper issues. The company's financial health appears stable based on the provided data, but profitability is inconsistent.  Missing information on recent news, analyst opinions, and the full relative divergence data prevents a conclusive assessment. A comprehensive analysis needs more data points regarding recent news, the 20-day relative divergence, and a comparison to analyst expectations on earnings. The provided expected return of 0% conflicts with the data showing alpha and therefore needs reconciliation.

**8. Recommendations:**

A more detailed analysis incorporating recent news, complete technical indicators, a full earnings analysis, and additional market context is required before any specific investment recommendations can be made. The current data presents a complex picture requiring further study to determine if the current underperformance reflects temporary market conditions or underlying issues within PepsiCo.
