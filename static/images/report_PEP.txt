## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo Inc. is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 36.04% for PEP, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 122.83% over the same period. The difference is a substantial -86.8 percentage points.  The relative divergence indicates PEP's performance is at the lowest percentile compared to its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

**Analysis of Alpha and Beta:**

The provided alpha and beta values (0.1) suggest PEP has slightly outperformed the market in some periods (positive alpha), but it's relatively consistent with market movements (beta close to 1, although not explicitly stated here). However, the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values show significant volatility and periods of substantial underperformance, especially in recent years.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $148.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $148.01
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $148.41
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $156.58

The price is slightly above the 5 and 20-day moving averages, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it's significantly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a longer-term downtrend.  The recent price change of $0.36 (from the previous close) does not represent a significant jump.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 40.92 - This suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.43 - A positive value, but relatively low, signifying neutral to slightly bullish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence:**  0.0 (-) - Shows recent short-term downward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** -711.6% - This extremely negative expected return over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is concerning and needs further investigation. The extremely negative prediction should be considered unreliable.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While there were strong quarters (e.g., 2024-07-11 and 2023-10-10), there are also signs of weakening performance. There's a duplicate entry for 2024-10-08.  Further clarification on which data point is correct is needed.  A more comprehensive analysis requires a longer time horizon to establish trends.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has fluctuated, with a notable drop in Q1 2024. Profit margins have remained relatively stable, suggesting good cost control.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable, but ROE (Return on Equity) shows considerable fluctuations, indicating variations in profitability over time.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500.  While some short-term indicators suggest a potential bounce, the long-term outlook, indicated by the heavily negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 and consistently negative CAGR values from the last few years, is concerning. The companyâ€™s financial performance shows some inconsistencies, requiring further investigation into the reasons for revenue fluctuations and the cause of the dramatically negative projected return.  Before making any investment decision, a thorough review of the reasons behind the negative expected return and a deeper dive into the company's financial health and future growth prospects are crucial.  The provided -711.6% expected return should be regarded as highly suspect and unreliable.  Further investigation is needed.

**8. Disclaimer:** This analysis is based on the limited data provided. It is not financial advice.  Conduct your own thorough research before making any investment decisions.  The negative predicted return should be scrutinized carefully for its methodology and underlying assumptions.
