*   RSI: 67.78
*   PPO: 0.2182

*   Expected Return (%): -283.8

**Analysis:**

*   **PPO:** The Positive Phase Oscillator (PPO) being slightly positive suggests a minor uptrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommendation for 100% investment and a 0% cash position is inconsistent with the other negative indicators, making the reliability of the signal suspect.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative divergence change confirms recent underperformance relative to the comparison stock.
*   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return is a major red flag, suggesting poor future performance if held long-term.

*   **Consensus:** Hold
*   **Mean Rating:** 2.75 (~Hold)
*   **Target Price:** 153.91 (Average)
