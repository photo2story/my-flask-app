2024-12-25 - Analysis Report
## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The provided data shows PEP's cumulative return at 40.19% significantly lags behind the S&P 500 (VOO) at 120.69%, resulting in a large negative divergence (-80.5%). This places it at the 0% percentile of the historical range of divergence.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals consistently positive alpha (0.1) across the periods, suggesting PEP outperformed the market slightly in terms of risk-adjusted return.  However, the beta values near 0.1 indicate low sensitivity to market movements.  Noteworthy is the significantly negative CAGR of -26% in 2022-2024, which heavily influenced the overall cumulative return.  High Maximum Drawdowns (MDDs), particularly in 2022-2024, point to substantial periods of price decline.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $152.81
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $152.56
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $157.49
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $163.51

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (35.61):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce back.
* **PPO (-0.28):** A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-1.0):** Shows a recent downward trend in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The provided data suggests no significant expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).  Given the past underperformance, further underperformance is a significant possibility.

The current price of $152.81, below all moving averages and with negative technical indicators, doesn't suggest an immediate sharp rebound.  A gradual recovery is more likely given the oversold condition (RSI).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data reveals some volatility.  Revenue has fluctuated but generally maintained a relatively high level.

* **EPS:** Shows significant variation, with a notable drop in Q1 2024 (1.49) compared to previous quarters.  However, this was followed by a recovery in subsequent quarters.  Without expected values it's impossible to judge whether these were beats or misses.
* **Revenue:**  Generally strong and has displayed some cyclical variation but no significant downward trend.  Q4 2023 shows a significant revenue spike that was not maintained in following quarters.
* **Overall:**  Earnings show inconsistencies quarter to quarter, making it difficult to establish a clear trend without further context (e.g., market conditions, one-off events).

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some volatility, but profit margins remain relatively stable and high, ranging from 52.97% to 55.92%.  This suggests strong pricing power and efficiency.  The significant revenue drop in Q1 2024 is concerning.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity has generally increased, while ROE fluctuates considerably.  The lower ROE in Q1 2024 aligns with the lower profit margin and needs further analysis to determine the cause.

Overall, the financial health appears robust, but the recent quarterly results require deeper investigation to explain variations.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent market outlook information was provided.  This would be crucial for a more comprehensive analysis.  Analyst opinions are also missing.


**7. Overall Analysis Summary:**

PEP's stock performance significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently. While it exhibits positive alpha, suggesting slightly better risk-adjusted returns, its recent performance and negative CAGR raise concerns. Technical indicators point to an oversold condition but a negative momentum. Financials reveal overall strong profitability but inconsistent quarterly results that need further clarification.  The absence of recent news and analyst opinions limits a complete evaluation.  More in-depth analysis, including sector comparisons and future growth projections, is crucial for a confident investment recommendation.  Given the recent significant underperformance, caution is advised.
