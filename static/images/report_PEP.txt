**7. Overall Summary and Conclusion**

PepsiCo (PEP) is currently showing signs of underperformance compared to the S&P 500 (VOO). While the Market Risk Indicator is low, and the short-term price movement is slightly positive, the negative Alpha, high Maximum Drawdown, and, most importantly, the extremely negative Expected Return of -192.9% are serious concerns. Recent news indicates volatility and significant company events requiring investor monitoring. While revenue remains significant, the recent decrease in EPS and the lower ROE compared to previous periods indicate potential challenges.  Based on this analysis, caution is warranted. The negative expected return suggests that, based on the model's assumptions and historical data, an investment in PEP is predicted to significantly underperform the broader market over the long term.
