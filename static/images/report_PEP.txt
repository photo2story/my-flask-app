**6) Overall Conclusion:**

PEP shows consistent profitability and high profit margins. However, its recent performance lags behind the S&P 500, with negative CAGR in the recent two years.  While short-term indicators suggest a slightly bearish trend, the long-term outlook appears more positive, given the projected 5.1% outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the reasons for recent underperformance and the duplicated earnings data is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The relatively low beta suggests that PEP is less volatile than the overall market, a factor to consider in risk assessment.  Investors should carefully consider the risk tolerance and long-term investment horizon before making any decision regarding PEP.
