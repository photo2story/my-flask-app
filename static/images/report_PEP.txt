**1. Performance Comparison:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  Over the analyzed period, PEP significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a cumulative return of 34.77% compared to VOO's 82.57%.  This represents a difference of -47.8%. While the relative divergence of 16.1% suggests this underperformance is not entirely unprecedented historically, it still indicates a notable lag behind the broader market.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows inconsistent alpha (ranging from -2.0% to 0.5%) and a relatively stable beta (around 0.3-0.4), suggesting a moderate sensitivity to market movements, but limited ability to outperform the market consistently over the different periods.  Noteworthy is the significantly negative CAGR (-39% and -31%) in the most recent periods (2022-2024 and 2023-2025), which significantly impacted the overall performance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

PEP's current price ($135.31) is below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a bearish short-term trend.  The price is significantly below the moving averages, suggesting downward momentum.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 30.33 suggests the stock is oversold, potentially indicating a bounce is possible. However, the negative PPO (-0.44) points to bearish momentum. The recent negative relative divergence (-7.7%) reinforces the short-term bearish trend. The MRI of 0.4053 suggests medium risk.  The expected return of 0.6% over the long term is relatively modest compared to the historical S&P 500 returns, suggesting limited outperformance is expected.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2025-04-24 | 1.34  | 17.92 B$      |
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13  | 23.32 B$      |
| 2024-07-11 | 2.24  | 22.50 B$      |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.49  | 18.25 B$      |
| 2025-04-24 | 1.49  | 18.25 B$      |


Earnings show some volatility.  There's a noticeable dip in EPS and revenue in Q1 2025 compared to the previous quarters, which warrants further investigation into the underlying causes.  The duplicated entry for 2025-04-24 needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  This missing information significantly hinders a complete assessment of PEP's financial health and future prospects.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some technical indicators suggest oversold conditions, the negative PPO and recent price action point to a continued bearish trend in the short term.  The inconsistent alpha and missing key financial data prevent a conclusive long-term outlook. The relatively modest expected long-term return (0.6% above S&P 500) suggests caution.  Further investigation into the Q1 2025 earnings dip and the acquisition of complete financial data are crucial for a more thorough assessment.  Investors should consider the significant underperformance relative to the market before making any investment decisions.
