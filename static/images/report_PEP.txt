While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market, indicated by values greater than 0), suggesting periods of strong manager skill or favorable sector conditions, others show negative alpha.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)  This suggests a relatively high level of market risk.
* **RSI:** 38.65 (Below 40, indicating oversold conditions)

A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy might still be considered if the fundamental business remains strong despite the current negative outlook.  However, the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 raises serious questions.

**6.  Overall Analysis:**

PepsiCo's recent performance has been underwhelming compared to the S&P 500. While it shows consistent profitability and a relatively stable market capitalization, the significant underperformance, high market risk indicators, and negative expected return raise serious concerns. The recent price decline and negative technical indicators further fuel bearish sentiment.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind the underperformance, especially during 2022-2024,  and a careful examination of the duplicated data points are necessary before making any investment decisions.  Despite the historically high profit margins, the current market conditions suggest a cautious approach.  Further analysis of industry trends and competitive pressures is recommended before assessing long-term investment potential.  The -26.9% expected return is a significant red flag requiring careful consideration and potentially deeper analysis of the company's strategic positioning and future prospects.
