**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals a mixed picture for PepsiCo.

* **Latest Quarterly Results Comparison:** The most recent quarter (ending 2024-10-08) shows a decrease in both EPS ($2.13 vs $2.24 in the previous quarter) and revenue ($23.32B vs $22.50B).

* **EPS Trends and Significant Changes:**  EPS also shows volatility. There's a decrease from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024. The significant drop from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024 warrants further investigation, although the data doesn't offer sufficient context for determining the cause of fluctuations. The duplication of Oct 2024 data obscures the trend.

* **Beats or Misses:** The provided data lacks information on expected EPS and revenue figures; therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the reported results beat or missed expectations.

The lack of recent news, market outlook, and analyst opinions prevents a complete picture of the current situation. More complete data is needed to reach a more robust conclusion.

To improve this analysis, the following information is needed:

* **Clarification of duplicated data:** The identical data points for October 2024 need clarification.
