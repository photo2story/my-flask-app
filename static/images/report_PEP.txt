PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The provided data shows PEP's cumulative return at 39.19%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) at 115.96%.  The divergence is -76.8%, placing it at the 3.9th percentile of its historical range (max: 22.8%, min: -80.8%).

Alpha consistently hovers around 0.1, suggesting slight outperformance relative to the market's beta (which is roughly 1), but this is overshadowed by the overall cumulative underperformance.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $151.72
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $152.23
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $156.13
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $162.71

The stock is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 30.20 (Suggests the stock is in oversold territory)
* **PPO:** -0.13 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.8 (Indicates short-term upward momentum, despite the longer-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return:** -161.8% (This extremely negative value requires further clarification, specifically its calculation method and timeframe.  As is, it suggests a very high risk investment and is likely unrealistic for a long-term investment horizon.)

The current price of $151.72, being below the moving averages, doesn't indicate a significant sudden movement (neither a sharp rebound nor a sharp drop) *based solely on this data*.  The -161.8% expected return needs further context to be interpreted meaningfully.

* **EPS:** Similar volatility exists in EPS, with no clear upward or downward trend.  EPS was highest in Q2 2024 ($2.24) and Q4 2023 ($2.25). There's no clear pattern of beats or misses against expectations without additional data.
* **Overall:** The quarterly data suggests inconsistency in both revenue and EPS performance.  A more thorough analysis needs comparison with analyst estimates and industry benchmarks.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

This section requires additional information.  The prompt mentions "recent earning news" but does not provide details on any news items, analyst opinions, or market outlook within the last two days.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly, showing a substantial negative divergence.  Recent price action indicates a downtrend.

The exceptionally low (-161.8%) expected return needs significant clarification before interpretation.  Overall, the data paints a picture of a company with inconsistent performance, currently underperforming the market and requiring further investigation to determine the reasons for its recent struggles before a sound investment decision can be made.  Additional news and market analysis are crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.
