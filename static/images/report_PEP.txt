**PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Analysis Report**

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo Inc. is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The cumulative return of PEP over the analyzed period is 39.04%, significantly lagging the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 121.09%.  The difference is a substantial -82.1%, placing it at the 4.3rd percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500 (based on the provided minimum and maximum divergence).  This indicates underperformance compared to the broader market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $151.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $151.25
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $148.17
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $155.28

The recent price is slightly above the 5-day moving average, suggesting some short-term upward momentum. However, it is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-to-medium term downtrend.  The price shows a recent slight increase from the previous close (+$1.02).  This isn't a significant jump and doesn't indicate a rapid rebound.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 61.58  - This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a relatively neutral position.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.68 - A positive value suggests upward momentum, although the magnitude is modest.
* **Recent Relative Strength:** 4.3 (+) - This signifies short-term upward momentum, aligning with the slight price increase.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -158.8% - This exceptionally negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern and warrants further investigation into the underlying assumptions. This projection needs significant scrutiny; it's highly improbable unless extremely bearish market conditions are anticipated.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PepsiCo shows strong profitability and relatively stable revenue, although recent earnings data is inconsistent and requires clarification.  The stock's performance significantly lags the S&P 500, raising concerns. The extremely negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 is alarming and requires further examination.  Technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly positive short-term outlook, but the long-term outlook is heavily dependent on the accuracy of the -158.8% expected return projection, which is highly questionable based on typical market behavior.  More thorough investigation is necessary to understand the reasons behind the significant underperformance and the highly negative long-term return projection.  Inconsistent earnings data should also be addressed to allow for an accurate and comprehensive assessment of PEP's performance.
