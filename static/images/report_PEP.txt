**7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)**

PepsiCo (PEP) is currently facing several challenges. While it is a well-established dividend stock, it has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently. Technical indicators suggest a short-term downtrend, although the RSI indicates it may be oversold. Analyst consensus is neutral ("Hold").

The mixed news flow, decreasing EPS and ROE, and a potentially oversold state require careful consideration. Recent earnings and capital data indicates decreased ROE and inconsistent revenue.

**Recommendation:**
Given the information and the caution from the Hybrid Signal, a conservative approach is warranted. Further research is recommended to assess the factors contributing to the underperformance and declining ROE before making any investment decisions.
