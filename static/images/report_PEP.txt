## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Report

**0) Introduction:** This report analyzes PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), a global food and beverage company, based on provided financial data.  We will compare its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO), examine recent price movements, and assess key financial indicators.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's.

* **PEP Cumulative Return:** 38.83%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 112.87%
* **Return Difference:** -74.0%  This indicates PEP underperformed the S&P 500 significantly over the period considered. The relative divergence of -14.9% places its performance in the lower 14.9% percentile compared to the historical range of its underperformance relative to the S&P500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying Alpha and Beta values across different periods.  While Alpha generally suggests some degree of outperformance (positive Alpha) relative to the market (Beta), the highly variable results and occasionally negative CAGR suggest that these outperformance periods weren't consistent.  The high Max Drawdown (-75%) in recent years highlights significant risk.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 22.0% | 2.2% | -6.0% | 0.1 | 133.9 |

**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $152.02
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $153.46
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $148.01
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $150.94

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a recent pullback.  It's above the 20-day moving average, indicating some short-term support.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 63.8 -  Indicates neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
* **PPO:** 0.72 - Suggests a positive momentum.
* **Recent Relative Strength Change:** +10.5% - Shows short-term upward momentum.


The recent price change of $0.34 (0.22%) is not significant enough to classify as a sharp move. The expected return of -43.3% is concerning and suggests potential underperformance compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term investment (2+ years).  This significant negative expected return needs further investigation to ascertain if this is justified and if it warrants further risk aversion.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue. While there's an overall trend of relatively stable revenue, EPS fluctuates, possibly due to seasonal effects or strategic changes.  Further detailed financial statements are required to interpret the nature and sustainability of this fluctuation.

| 날짜 | EPS | 매출 |
|---|---|---|
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | 23.32 B$ |
| 2024-07-11 | 2.24 | 22.50 B$ |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.49 | 18.25 B$ |
| 2023-10-10 | 2.25 | 23.45 B$ |
| 2024-10-08 | 2.25 | 23.45 B$ |


**5) Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability sections reveal inconsistent data in terms of trends and ratios. There is a noticeable peak in Revenue and a dip in equity mid-year, which requires additional information (e.g., industry benchmarks, economic factors) to understand the volatility. Further deep dive analysis into the reasons behind these fluctuations is needed.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $27.78B | 52.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $23.32B | 55.42% |
| 2024-06-30 | $22.50B | 55.92% |
| 2024-03-31 | $18.25B | 54.81% |
| 2023-12-31 | $27.85B | 52.97% |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $18.04B | 8.44% |
| 2024-09-30 | $19.45B | 15.06% |
| 2024-06-30 | $19.45B | 15.85% |
| 2024-03-31 | $19.05B | 10.72% |
| 2023-12-31 | $18.50B | 7.04% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

PepsiCo (PEP) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period. While some quarters show positive momentum and profitability, the overall picture reveals volatility and inconsistency in earnings, revenue, and key financial ratios. The negative projected long-term return and historical drawdowns highlight substantial risk.  Further investigation into the reasons behind this underperformance, including macroeconomic factors and company-specific strategies, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The provided data alone does not offer sufficient justification for long-term investment in PEP based on the given projections.
