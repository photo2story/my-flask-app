**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  PEP's cumulative return of 33.99% significantly lags behind the S&P 500's 87.98% return. The difference of -54% places it in the 9.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, indicating substantial underperformance.  This underperformance is consistent across the provided CAGR data (points 2).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying Alpha and Beta values across different periods.  While Alpha is generally positive (indicating some outperformance), Beta values hover around 0.3-0.5, suggesting lower volatility than the market (lower correlation with VOO movement). However, the recent negative CAGR, especially in 2022-2025 (-39% and -32%), significantly impacts the overall performance.  Note that MDD (Maximum Drawdown) is consistently high, suggesting potential significant losses during periods of market downturn.  Market cap has relatively fluctuated, yet shows an overall upward trend prior to 2022-2025.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $131.43
* **Last Market Price:** $130.44 (-0.75 change)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $131.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $137.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $145.13

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent price drop of $0.75 reflects a short-term negative pressure.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (24.10):**  Indicates oversold conditions, suggesting potential for a rebound.
* **PPO (-0.32):** Shows a bearish signal, confirming the downward trend.
* **Relative Divergence (-2.6):**  Shows a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (-5.6%):**  Suggests a negative expected return, likely due to recent underperformance.  The long-term (2+ years) expected return relative to the S&P 500 is unclear but likely to be underperforming given the recent trends.  The -5.6% should be taken within the context of this short-term observation.

The relatively large negative change in the last market data (-$0.75) highlights a short-term negative price movement but doesn't necessarily indicate a significant crash or rapid decline.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출        |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2025-04-24 | 1.34 | $17.92B     |
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | $23.32B     |

| 2024-04-23 | 1.49 | $18.25B     |
| 2025-04-24 | 1.49 | $18.25B     |

EPS and revenue fluctuate quarterly. The most recent data (2025-04-24) shows a decline in both EPS and revenue compared to the previous quarters, which might contribute to the current negative sentiment in the market.  There appears to be a duplication of data for 2025-04-24.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $17.92B  | 55.77%        |
| 2024-12-31 | $27.78B  | 52.56%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $23.32B  | 55.42%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $22.50B  | 55.92%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $18.25B  | 54.81%        |

Profit margins are consistently high, suggesting strong profitability. However, revenue shows significant quarterly fluctuations.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE     |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| 2025-03-31 | $18.39B  | 9.97%   |
| 2024-12-31 | $18.04B  | 8.44%   |
| 2024-09-30 | $19.45B  | 15.06%  |
| 2024-06-30 | $19.45B  | 15.85%  |
| 2024-03-31 | $19.05B  | 10.72%  |

Equity and ROE also show fluctuations.  High ROE values suggest effective use of capital.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's recent performance has been underwhelming compared to the S&P 500.  While the company boasts strong profitability and high profit margins, recent declines in EPS and revenue, coupled with bearish technical indicators (low RSI and negative PPO), suggest a negative short-term outlook. The substantial underperformance relative to the broader market needs further investigation.  The high MDD values in the CAGR table further suggest risk.  Long-term investors should carefully consider the recent underperformance and volatility before making investment decisions.  Further analysis of macroeconomic factors and industry trends is needed for a more comprehensive assessment.  The duplicated data point for 2025-04-24 needs clarification.
