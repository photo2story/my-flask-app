**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly, despite exhibiting relatively stable profit margins and some signs of positive momentum in some technical indicators.

More comprehensive data, including a comparison with expected earnings and analyst opinions, is needed for a thorough evaluation.  The provided expected return of 0% relative to the S&P 500 suggests that, currently, long-term investment in PEP may not significantly outperform a diversified market investment.
