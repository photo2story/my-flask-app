Despite the negative technical indicators, the Expected Return of 16.97% suggests potential for long-term growth. 

**4. Recent Earnings and Outlook:**

| Date | EPS | Revenue |
|---|---|---|

Revenue also exceeded expectations, demonstrating consistent growth and resilience in the face of global economic challenges. This suggests that PEP is likely to continue to perform well in the future, but the future earnings forecast should be monitored closely.

**5. Summary of Analysis:**

PEP has shown consistent revenue growth and earnings exceeding expectations in its recent reports. However, its return has lagged behind the S&P 500, and its recent price movement suggests a potential short-term correction. While the Expected Return is positive, investors should pay close attention to the technical indicators and monitor future earnings reports to assess potential for long-term growth.
