2025-12-29 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive report on PepsiCo (PEP) based on the data provided, broken down into the requested sections:

**1) Return Rate Comparison (PEP vs. VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** PepsiCo Inc. is a global food and beverage company.
*   **PEP Cumulative Return:** 16.97%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 103.21%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current: -80.3
    *   Relative Divergence: 6.4 (This indicates PEP's relative performance compared to VOO is near the lower end of its historical range)

**Analysis:** PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period considered. The substantial negative divergence suggests that an investment in PEP would have yielded considerably lower returns than a simple index fund tracking the S&P 500. The very low relative divergence reinforces the idea that the underperformance is near its worst levels within the provided timeframe.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha  | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|------|--------|
| 2015-2017  | 25.0%  | 12.4%  | -3.0%  | 0.1  | 164.2  |
| 2016-2018  | 8.0%   | 64.1%  | -7.0%  | 0.0  | 151.3  |
| 2017-2019  | 27.0%  | 64.1%  | 4.0%   | 0.4  | 187.1  |
| 2018-2020  | 19.0%  | 81.0%  | -5.0%  | 0.4  | 203.0  |
| 2019-2021  | 40.0%  | 81.0%  | -7.0%  | 0.6  | 237.8  |
| 2020-2022  | 5.0%   | 81.0%  | 6.0%   | 0.5  | 247.3  |
| 2021-2023  | 9.0%   | 79.7%  | 8.0%   | 0.4  | 232.5  |
| 2022-2024  | -28.0% | 73.0%  | -49.0% | 0.3  | 208.2  |
| 2023-2025  | -23.0% | 75.0%  | -90.0% | 0.4  | 196.8  |

*   **CAGR:** Shows the compound annual growth rate over the respective period. Significant variability exists, with some periods showing strong growth and recent periods showing negative growth.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) indicates the largest peak-to-trough decline during the period. The consistently high MDD values suggest significant volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha measures the investment's performance relative to a benchmark (presumably the S&P 500). Negative alpha values indicate underperformance relative to the benchmark.  The recent severe negative alpha of -90% is particularly concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta measures the investment's volatility relative to the market. Beta values close to 0 suggest low correlation with the market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization in Billions.

**Analysis:** The Alpha/Beta analysis paints a mixed picture, particularly in recent years. While PEP has demonstrated strong growth in some periods, the recent negative CAGR and extremely negative Alpha figures are worrying. The relatively low Beta values suggest that PEP's price movements are not strongly correlated with the overall market, and its current low Alpha suggests a big drop in performance compared to the market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 143.78
*   **Previous Close:** 143.74
*   **Change:** 0.03
*   **5-day SMA:** 145.282
*   **20-day SMA:** 147.5647
*   **60-day SMA:** 147.1112

**Analysis:**  The current price is slightly up from the previous close, but below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This *could* suggest a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, further supporting this idea.

**3) Indicators**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 46.38 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.45 (Bearish)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -241.5 (Very negative expected return)

**Analysis:** The indicators present a conflicting picture:
    *   The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, seemingly contradictory to the other data.
    *   The RSI is neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions.
    *   The negative PPO suggests a downtrend.
    *   The Hybrid signal, despite recommending buying, acknowledges the "Very Safe" MRI of 0.90.
    *   The negative divergence change further signals a short-term downtrend.
    *   The extremely negative Expected Return is a major red flag, suggesting very poor future performance.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Headlines:** The articles mentioning "Dividend Stocks to Buy" could be seen as a positive signal for income-seeking investors, even though its about sector, not specific stock.
*   **Negative Headlines:** The articles highlighting risks ("What Could Go Wrong," "Even Pepsico Stock Has Big Risks," "Stock Sinks") suggest caution is warranted. The article about PineStone Asset Management selling shares adds to the negative sentiment.
*   **Overall Impression:** The news is mixed to negative, with a clear emphasis on potential risks and concerns about the stock's performance.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (2.71)
*   **Target Price:** 155.91 (suggests a potential upside from the current price)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:**  No information on changes provided.

**Analysis:** Analysts, on average, have a "Hold" rating on PEP. The average target price is higher than the current price, suggesting they anticipate some appreciation. However, without knowing the recent rating changes, it's difficult to assess the strength of their conviction.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis**

Overall, the data suggests a cautious outlook for PEP.

*   **Underperformance:** PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500.
*   **Conflicting Signals:**  The MRI gives a high investment recommendation, but this contradicts many other indicators, especially the extremely negative expected return and declining Alpha.

*   **Analyst Opinion:** Analysts have a Hold recommendation with a slightly higher target price.
*   **Fluctuating Financials:** Revenue, EPS, and ROE are variable.

**Conclusion:** While PepsiCo is a large and established company, the data suggests potential challenges. A significant concern is the expected return compared to the S&P 500 in the long-term. The very negative expected return signals caution in investing in the company. The recommendation would be to proceed with extreme caution and conduct further due diligence before investing.
