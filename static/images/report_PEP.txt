* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.12 - Suggests a bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +5.8 - Short-term upward momentum.  Given the low RSI this could indicate short term upward movement but may not be sustainable.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% - The provided expected return of 0% indicates that over the long term (2+ years) assuming consistent investment this stock is not expected to provide significant outperformance against the S&P 500. This is consistent with the observed underperformance.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. While some technical indicators (RSI) suggest potential for a short-term bounce, the overall picture remains bearish based on its price movement relative to moving averages and the PPO.  Recent earnings show some volatility, but generally positive revenue with relatively stable profitability metrics.  More information is needed, particularly regarding analyst expectations and recent news, to form a more complete and informed opinion. The expected return of 0% against the S&P 500 over a long period suggests a re-evaluation of the investment strategy is in order.  Given this the stock should only be considered if its industry specific fundamentals are expected to outperform the market significantly over a longer time horizon.
