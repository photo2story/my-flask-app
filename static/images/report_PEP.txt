**0. Summary Statistics:**

* **Ticker:** PEP
* **Company:** PepsiCo Inc. (a global food and beverage company)
* **Cumulative Return (PEP):** 34.77%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 82.57%

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PepsiCo's cumulative return significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. The -47.8% difference highlights this underperformance.  The relative divergence of 16.1% suggests this underperformance is not an extreme outlier within the historical context of PEP's performance relative to VOO, although it's still substantially below average.

The provided alpha and beta data show mixed results. While CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates across years, reaching impressive highs (63% in 2019-2021),  the recent period (2022-2025) shows significant negative growth.  Alpha generally hovers around 0, suggesting that PEP's performance hasn't consistently outperformed the market (as reflected by the underperformance compared to VOO). Beta, generally around 0.3-0.4, indicates moderate market sensitivity; PEP's price tends to move in line with the broader market, but less dramatically.  The significant MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values in the later years are concerning and warrant further investigation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $135.31
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $141.12
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $144.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $147.28

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend.  The recent price drop of $4.89 (-3.43%) compared to the previous close indicates a significant short-term decline.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 30.33 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential for a rebound, but not confirming it)
* **PPO:** -0.44 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -7.7% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 0.6%  This suggests a low projected long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  The recent price drop significantly contributes to this low expectation.  Further analysis of the underlying reasons for this price drop would be crucial.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

There appears to be an error in the data with the duplicate entry for 2025-04-24.  Excluding this, there's noticeable fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  A more in-depth analysis would be needed, including a comparison to previous years and an investigation into the underlying reasons for the variations.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PepsiCo's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500.  While the company demonstrates strong profitability and consistent revenue, the recent price decline and negative growth projections raise concerns.  The technical indicators suggest an oversold condition, but this doesn't guarantee a price rebound.  The low expected return relative to the S&P 500 and the high maximum drawdowns in the historical data present a less optimistic outlook for the short term. A deeper dive into the reasons for the recent underperformance (e.g., macroeconomic factors, competitive pressures, changes in consumer behavior) is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data inconsistencies require clarification before drawing definitive conclusions.
