This report analyzes PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), a global food and beverage company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's.  The difference as of the last data point is -77.4%, placing it at the 10th percentile (relative divergence of 0.1) compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.  While the provided CAGR data shows periods of outperformance, the long-term cumulative return lags considerably behind the market benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 161.70
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 162.62
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 162.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 168.92

The stock price is currently trading below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  It's also significantly below its 60-day moving average, indicating a more pronounced downward trend. The last market price of 159.79 is not significantly different from the closing price, and doesn't indicate a sharp movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 43.23 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** 0.30 (Positive, but relatively low, indicating weak bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** NaN (-), indicating a recent short-term downward trend.

The low RSI and relatively low PPO, along with the negative recent relative divergence, all point towards a bearish outlook in the short term. The expected return of 0.0% indicates that, based on the currently available data, the model projects no significant excess return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). This should be viewed cautiously, as any model is limited by the data it's fed and external market conditions are not accounted for.
