PepsiCo's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500, with negative alpha and concerning recent CAGR figures. While the company shows relatively stable profitability,  a high Market Risk Indicator, negative PPO, and a projected negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 raise significant concerns.  Before recommending an investment, a more in-depth analysis, including a thorough examination of the company's competitive landscape, future growth prospects, and macroeconomic factors, is crucial. The current data suggests caution regarding long-term investment in PEP.
