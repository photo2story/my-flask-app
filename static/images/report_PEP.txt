**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta  | Cap(B)  |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|-------|---------|
| 2015-2017  | 25.0%  | 12.4%  | -3.0%   | 0.1   | 159.3   |

| 2018-2020  | 19.0%  | 81.0%  | -5.0%   | 0.4   | 197.0   |
| 2019-2021  | 40.0%  | 81.0%  | -7.0%   | 0.6   | 230.7   |
| 2020-2022  | 5.0%   | 81.0%  | 6.0%    | 0.5   | 240.0   |

| 2022-2024  | -28.0% | 73.0%  | -49.0%  | 0.3   | 202.0   |
| 2023-2025  | -19.0% | 75.0%  | -84.0%  | 0.4   | 196.8   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Fluctuating, with negative growth in the most recent periods (2022-2024, 2023-2025).
*   **MDD:** High Maximum Drawdown figures, particularly in recent years, indicating significant price volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:** Predominantly negative, especially in the last two periods.  Negative alpha suggests that PEP is underperforming relative to its risk (Beta).  The steep decline in recent periods suggests increasing underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Relatively low, indicating that PEP's price movements are less correlated with the overall market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has generally increased but has recently decreased, reflecting poor investor sentiment and/or company performance.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 148.16
*   **Last Market:** Price: 143.74, Previous Close: 143.68, Change: 0.04
*   **5-day SMA:** 149.84
*   **20-day SMA:** 147.95
*   **60-day SMA:** 146.88

**Analysis:** The current price (143.74) is below the 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), but above the 60-day SMA.  This *could* suggest a short-term downward trend, but the current price being very close to the 20-day SMA means that this downtrend has potentially come to a halt. The very small 'change' in the 'Last Market' data suggests a very stable price.

**3. Market Risk Indicators, RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.8 (Medium Investment)
*   **RSI:** 50.36 (Neutral - neither overbought nor oversold)
*   **PPO:** 0.09 (Close to zero, indicating price is stable)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI: 0.90)
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** -2.0 (Short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -241.5% (Expected Excess Return Compared to S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   The MRI of 0.8 suggests a "Medium Investment" recommendation, but the Hybrid Signal pushes towards a buy.
*   The RSI indicates neutral momentum.
*   The PPO suggests that the price is stable.
*   The negative relative divergence change confirms the short-term decline.
*   The VERY negative expected return is extremely concerning. It projects significant underperformance versus the S&P 500 over a long-term investment horizon.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **PepsiCo (PEP) Stock Sinks As Market Gains:** Indicates underperformance relative to the market.
*   **Elliott-Backed Cost Cuts, 2026 Outlook and Dividend Growth Take Center Stage:** Suggests activist investor pressure for improved performance and potential restructuring or efficiency measures.
*   **PepsiCo: Offering Value Amid Domestic Struggles:** Hints at challenges in the domestic market but potential value proposition.
*   **1 Surprising Chip Stock Every Investor Should Own In 2026:** Unclear if PepsiCo is the chip stock.
*   **PepsiCo Stock (PEP) Drops After the Close on Dec. 23, 2025:** Reinforces recent negative price action.
*   **3 Dividend Growth Stocks Analysts Are Upgrading for 2026:** May or may not include PepsiCo.

**Analysis:** The news headlines are generally negative, focusing on underperformance, cost-cutting, and domestic struggles. The Elliott Management involvement suggests a potential catalyst for change, but the immediate impact appears to be negative. Dividend growth focus could be a positive point for investors seeking income.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Hold (Mean: 2.71)
*   **Target Price:** 155.91 (Avg) / 172.00 (High) / 115.00 (Low)
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes indicated in the data.

**Analysis:** Analysts are, on average, neutral on PEP (Hold rating). The average target price suggests potential upside from the current price (143.74), but the wide range (115.00 - 172.00) reflects uncertainty.

**5. Recent Earnings Analysis**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2025-10-09 | 1.9  | 23.94 B$     |
| 2025-07-17 | 0.92 | 22.73 B$     |
| 2025-04-24 | 1.34 | 17.92 B$     |
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | 23.32 B$     |
| 2025-10-09 | 2.13 | 23.32 B$     |

**Analysis:** The earnings data reveals fluctuating EPS and revenue, with some inconsistencies (the duplicated 2025-10-09 entry). This data alone doesn't tell a clear story without comparing it to previous periods or analyst expectations. However, given the other negative data, it is likely that earnings have not been impressive.

**6. Financial Information**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Revenue   | Profit Margin |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| 2025-09-30   | $23.94B   | 53.57%         |
| 2025-06-30   | $22.73B   | 54.66%         |
| 2025-03-31   | $17.92B   | 55.77%         |
| 2024-12-31   | $27.78B   | 52.56%         |
| 2024-09-30   | $23.32B   | 55.42%         |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter      | Equity    | ROE       |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2025-09-30   | $19.39B   | 13.43%    |
| 2025-06-30   | $18.42B   | 6.86%     |
| 2025-03-31   | $18.39B   | 9.97%     |
| 2024-12-31   | $18.04B   | 8.44%     |
| 2024-09-30   | $19.45B   | 15.06%    |

**Analysis:**

*   **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue fluctuates, with the highest revenue in Q4 2024 ($27.78B) and the lowest in Q1 2025 ($17.92B). Profit margins are consistently high, hovering around 52-56%. However, the recent decline in profit margin could be a concern.
*   **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable. ROE (Return on Equity) is also fluctuating, with a recent decrease. A declining ROE can signal decreased profitability and efficiency in utilizing shareholder equity.

**7. Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Based on the provided data, PepsiCo (PEP) is currently facing several challenges:

*   **Significant Underperformance:**  PEP has drastically underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.
*   **Negative Alpha:** Suggests that PEP is underperforming relative to its risk (Beta).
*   **Recent Price Weakness:** The stock price is below short-term moving averages.
*   **Negative Expected Return:** The expected return is extremely negative, forecasting significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 in the long term.
*   **Mixed Analyst Sentiment:** Analysts are neutral ("Hold" rating) with a wide range of price targets, reflecting uncertainty.
*   **Activist Investor Pressure:** Elliott Management's involvement suggests a potential for change but may also indicate underlying issues.
*   **Fluctuating Financials:** Fluctuations in revenue, EPS, and ROE, with potential recent declines in profit margin and ROE, are areas of concern.

**Overall Recommendation:**

Based on the analyzed data, a **SELL** or **AVOID** recommendation seems most appropriate at this time. The significant underperformance, negative expected return, and negative news flow suggest a need for caution. While activist investor involvement could lead to positive changes, the near-term outlook appears challenging. More in-depth research is necessary to assess the potential impact of Elliott Management's plans and the company's ability to address its domestic struggles. Further analysis of future earnings reports and company guidance will be crucial to reassess the investment outlook for PEP.
