**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is concerning, particularly given the projected extremely negative expected return.  While the company shows reasonable profitability,  recent price trends are bearish. The negative alpha suggests the stock has not generated returns above what would be expected based on its beta (market risk).  The high relative divergence in underperformance indicates this is a relatively extreme situation compared to past performance.  Before considering any investment, a deeper dive into the reasons for underperformance (e.g., industry headwinds, company-specific issues) is necessary.  The extremely negative long-term expected return strongly suggests this investment should be approached with extreme caution.
