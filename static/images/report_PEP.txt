**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR   | MDD    | Alpha   | Beta   | Cap(B)  |
|------------|--------|--------|---------|--------|---------|

| 2019-2021  | 54.0%  | 81.0%  | -22.0%  | 0.8    | 237.8   |
| 2020-2022  | 27.0%  | 81.0%  | 8.0%    | 0.7    | 247.3   |

| 2023-2025  | -16.0% | 81.0%  | -84.0%  | 0.2    | 196.5   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Fluctuates significantly, indicating periods of strong and weak growth. The most recent periods (2022-2024 and 2023-2025) show negative growth.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** High MDD values across all periods suggest significant volatility and potential for large losses.
*   **Alpha:** Primarily negative, meaning PEP has underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500) on a risk-adjusted basis. The recent Alpha figures are especially concerning.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally below 1, indicating PEP is less volatile than the overall market. However, this also contributes to its underperformance during market upswings.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Cap in Billions):** Generally increased until recently, but has declined in the latest periods, likely due to poor performance.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 143.52
*   **Previous Close:** 144.16
*   **Change:** -0.44
*   **5-day SMA:** 143.888
*   **20-day SMA:** 146.951
*   **60-day SMA:** 147.2718

**Analysis:** The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA being the closest suggests some recent stabilization, but the overall trend is downward.  The slight price decrease from the previous close indicates continued negative pressure.

**3) Indicator Analysis:**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (Medium to High Investment Recommended) - Contradictory indicator given the recent performance data.
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 23.49 (Oversold) - Suggests the stock may be undervalued and due for a rebound.
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.42 (Negative) - Confirms the downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (1 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) - The hybrid signal is recommending a buy despite the negative indicators due to the MRI score, which is heavily influenced by fundamental analysis.
*   **Recent Relative Divergence Change:** 1.5 (+) (Short-Term Increase) - A short-term upward movement in the relative divergence suggests some recent positive change compared to the S&P 500, but it needs to be seen in the context of the overall underperformance.
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0% - No expected excess return compared to the S&P 500.

**Analysis:** The indicators present a mixed picture. While RSI suggests a potential rebound due to being oversold, PPO confirms the current downtrend. The Market Risk Indicator seems out of sync with the recent performance and negative alpha. The recent uptick in relative divergence offers a glimmer of hope, but its sustainability is questionable. The expected return of 0% is concerning for long-term investors.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis:**

PepsiCo is currently facing challenges. While the company has a strong brand and history, its stock has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. Negative alpha, recent negative CAGR, and high MDD highlight the stock's risk and underperformance.

Technicals paint a mixed picture. RSI suggests a potential short-term rebound, but the price is below key moving averages, and PPO confirms the downtrend. The Market Risk Indicator is surprisingly high given the recent performance, but the Hybrid Signal is still providing a buy signal.

Analyst sentiment is neutral ("Hold"), and the target price range indicates uncertainty. News is a mix of positive and neutral/negative headlines.

While revenue and profit margins have been relatively stable, ROE fluctuations are concerning.

**Overall, the data suggests caution. While there may be short-term trading opportunities, the long-term outlook is uncertain, and the stock currently offers no expected excess return compared to the S&P 500. The significant underperformance and high volatility warrant careful consideration before investing in PEP.**
