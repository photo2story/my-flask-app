**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  While some periods show strong growth (e.g., 2019-2021), recent years (2022-2025) have experienced significant negative CAGR.
*   **MDD:** Maximum Drawdown is high across all periods, indicating substantial potential for loss from peak to trough. The MDD figures are very high, indicating a significant risk element.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is generally negative, particularly in recent periods, suggesting PepsiCo has consistently underperformed its benchmark on a risk-adjusted basis.  The last two periods show significantly negative Alpha.
*   **Beta:** Beta is relatively low (around 0.3-0.6), meaning PepsiCo's price is less volatile than the overall market.
*   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has fluctuated, indicating changing investor sentiment and market conditions.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 143.78
*   **Last Market:** {'price': 144.24, 'previousClose': 143.78, 'change': 0.32}
*   **5-day SMA:** 145.28
*   **20-day SMA:** 147.56
*   **60-day SMA:** 147.11

**Analysis:**

The current closing price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMAs). This suggests a recent downward trend. The 5-day SMA is below the 20-day and 60-day SMAs, reinforcing the short-term bearish signal. The slight price increase in the last market is not substantial enough to change the general view.

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 46.38
*   **PPO:** -0.45
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (2 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.0 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -241.5%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite other bearish indicators, the MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, possibly based on a longer-term outlook.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 46.38 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions.
*   **PPO:** A negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a downward trend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Despite the MRI, the hybrid signal suggests a strong buy signal, which is confusing in the current context.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:**  The negative change in relative divergence confirms the recent short-term decline.
*   **Expected Return:** The extremely negative expected return suggests a very pessimistic outlook for PepsiCo over the next two years compared to the S&P 500.

The significant underperformance, negative technical indicators, and uncertain outlook suggest that it may not be the most attractive investment opportunity at this time.

Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment goals before making any decisions. The conflicting signals from MRI and other indicators suggest a need for further research and caution.
