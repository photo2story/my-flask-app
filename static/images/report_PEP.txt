**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's recent performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500. While some technical indicators suggest potential oversold conditions, the negative expected return and consistent underperformance raise concerns.  The significant historical maximum drawdowns highlight the inherent risk in investing in PEP.  Further investigation into the reasons for underperformance, such as industry-specific headwinds or company-specific issues, is warranted before making any investment decisions. The high profit margins and consistent revenue suggest underlying strength, but the considerable underperformance against the market necessitates caution.  Long-term investors should carefully consider the negative expected return in comparison to the S&P 500 before committing capital.
