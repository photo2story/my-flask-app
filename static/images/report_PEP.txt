* **Closing Price:** $145.45

* **Change:** -$1.16 (a 0.79% decrease)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $148.21

* **60-Day Moving Average:** $148.17

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The recent negative change is relatively small, but it is important to look for an overall pattern.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 – This indicates a low to medium risk level.
* **RSI:** 30.02 – This is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce but not a guaranteed upward movement.
* **PPO:** -0.54 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence:** -3.3 – This shows a recent short-term decline.
* **Expected Return:** -41.3% – This signifies a significant negative expected return compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term period (2+ years).  This is very concerning and should be investigated further.  The fact that it is a negative value implies PepsiCo is expected to significantly underperform the S&P 500 over the long term.

The recent price drop of -$1.16, while not drastically large, confirms the downward momentum and aligns with the other technical indicators.
