Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of PepsiCo (PEP) based on the data provided.

**0) Report Format:**

*   First, simple numbers are presented.
*   Then, a simple analysis of those numbers is provided.

**1) Return Rate Comparison:**

*   **PepsiCo (PEP) Overview:** PepsiCo is a global food and beverage company with a wide portfolio of brands.
*   **PEP Cumulative Return:** 17.28%
*   **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 102.21%
*   **Divergence:**
    *   Current Divergence: -84.9
    *   Relative Divergence: 2.3

**Analysis:** PEP has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period examined. The divergence is substantial (-84.9), placing it near the bottom of its historical divergence range (2.3 relative divergence).

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2024-2026  | 23.0% | 81.0% | -83.0% | 0.1 | 197.0 |

**Analysis:** This table forecasts for 2024-2026.  It shows a positive CAGR (23.0%), but a very high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 81.0%. The negative Alpha (-83.0%) reinforces the underperformance relative to the market. A Beta of 0.1 suggests the stock is far less volatile than the market. The market cap is at 197 Billion USD.
This is a strange combination: high volatility + low volatility + negative alpha. The analyst/algorithm probably expects very short term fluctuations, but expects PEP to underperform the wider market over this time period.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Close:** 144.16
*   **Last Market Data:** Price 143.9151, Previous Close 144.16, Change -0.17
*   **5-day SMA:** 143.92
*   **20-day SMA:** 147.1462
*   **60-day SMA:** 147.1798

**Analysis:**  The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a short-term downtrend. The 5-day SMA being the lowest suggests the recent decline is accelerating slightly. The latest market data indicates a small further decline on the last trading day.

**3) Indicators Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 48.51 (Neutral)
*   **PPO:** -0.4298 (Bearish)

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -2.7 (Negative - short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -744.0 (Significantly Negative)

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a high investment recommendation, contradicting much of the other data. The RSI is neutral, not providing a clear buy or sell signal. The PPO is bearish, supporting the downtrend observed in the moving averages. The hybrid signal is recommending to use all cash to buy. The recent relative divergence change confirms short-term underperformance. The extremely negative expected return is a *strong* negative indicator.

**Conclusion:**

Based on this data, **PepsiCo does not appear to be a strong investment at this time.** The significant underperformance relative to the market, the short-term downtrend, and the negative expected return are all significant concerns. While the company has stable financials and high profit margins, the mixed news and analyst opinions don't provide enough positive signals to outweigh the negatives. The MRI is an outlier, contradicting much of the other data. Further investigation is warranted to understand the discrepancy between the MRI and other indicators.
