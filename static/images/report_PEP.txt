**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PEP's cumulative return of 32.74% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return of 120.63% over the analyzed period. The difference is a substantial -87.9%. The provided relative divergence of 0.0 indicates PEP's performance is at the lowest percentile compared to the S&P 500's performance across the historical data considered in the calculation of the relative divergence.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values over different periods.  While Alpha (which measures excess returns compared to the market) is generally positive indicating some outperformance, Beta (which measures the volatility relative to the market) is relatively stable around 0.5-0.7, suggesting moderate market sensitivity. The significant negative CAGR of -27% in the most recent 2-year periods is alarming.  This needs further investigation into the market conditions during this period to fully understand these low returns. The market capitalization (Cap(B)) fluctuated but generally increased over the years.  High Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) in recent periods (up to -89%) highlight the risk associated with PEP during this timeframe.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  While there are some high revenue quarters,  there's also considerable fluctuation, and revenue in Q3 2024 dropped significantly compared to previous quarters. The EPS is relatively stable.  Further analysis is required to determine the drivers behind this revenue fluctuation. There's also a duplicated entry for 2024-10-08.


| 날짜       | EPS | 매출       |
|------------|-----|------------|
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | 23.32 B$   |
| 2024-07-11 | 2.24 | 22.50 B$   |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.49 | 18.25 B$   |
| 2023-10-10 | 2.25 | 23.45 B$   |

**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue has been relatively strong, though Q2 and Q3 2024 show some softening. Profit margins are consistently high (above 50%), indicating strong profitability. ROE (Return on Equity) is also volatile, ranging from a low of 7.04% to a high of 15.85% over the given period. This suggests inconsistent profitability relative to equity.  Further investigation is needed into the drivers of this variation in ROE.

|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $27.78B | 52.56%       |

**6.  Summary:**

PEP's performance has lagged significantly behind the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, with a substantial negative return difference. While the company shows consistent high profit margins,  recent earnings data reveals revenue volatility and a considerable decline in recent quarters. Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend, and the unusually low expected return requires further investigation.  The substantial negative CAGR for the most recent two-year periods raises serious concern.  Before investing, a thorough examination of the macroeconomic environment impacting PEP during these periods and the reasons behind the recent underperformance is crucial.  The high MDD figures highlight the risk associated with this stock.  A deeper dive into the company's specific strategies and future plans, along with a review of the calculation methodology used for the expected return, is necessary to fully assess the investment potential of PEP.
