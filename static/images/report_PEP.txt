## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The cumulative return of PEP is significantly lower than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  While PEP showed a cumulative return of 36.49%, VOO achieved 122.16%.  The provided data shows a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500,  with a substantial negative divergence of -85.7%, placing it at the 1st percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided alpha values consistently hover around 0.1, suggesting a slight outperformance relative to the market benchmark (after adjusting for risk), though the impact is limited. The Beta values are generally stable around 1, implying that PEP's price movements tend to correlate with the overall market. However, the CAGR and MDD (Maximum Drawdown) figures fluctuate considerably year over year, highlighting significant volatility and periods of both strong growth and considerable losses.  The recent negative CAGR (-27% and -24%) is a cause for concern.

* **Expected Return:** -704.2% – This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) is a major red flag and needs further investigation to understand the basis of this projection.
