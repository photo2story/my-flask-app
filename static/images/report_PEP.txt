**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No specific news or recent market outlook is provided for analysis. Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing.  This significantly limits the scope of the review.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's performance has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period. Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition and bearish momentum.  Earnings data shows some revenue growth, but EPS is inconsistent. Profit margins are high, but ROE fluctuates.  Without access to current news, analyst opinions, and a clarified expected return calculation, a conclusive assessment is difficult. The provided -664.5% expected return is highly improbable and cannot be relied upon for decision-making. Further investigation into the data sources and calculation methods is strongly recommended.  The significant underperformance versus the market, along with the bearish technical indicators, should be carefully considered.
