## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Performance Review

**0) Overview:** PepsiCo Inc. is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  This report analyzes PEP's recent performance against the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Performance Comparison:**

PEP's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500's.

* **PEP Cumulative Return:** 35.89%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 89.44%
* **Return Difference:** -53.55%

This places PEP's performance at the 17.9th percentile relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided minimum and maximum divergence (-72.1% to 32%).  This indicates underperformance compared to the benchmark.


**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows varying alpha and beta values across different periods.  While alpha is generally positive (indicating outperformance), the magnitude is small and inconsistent.  Beta values are consistently around 0.2-0.4, suggesting relatively low sensitivity to market movements compared to the S&P 500.  Note that the negative CAGR values in the last two years indicate significant underperformance.  The MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values indicate considerable risk in holding PEP during those times.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 16.0% | 5.9% | -1.0% | 0.2 | 131.8 |
| 2016-2018  | 7.0% | 8.8% | 0.0% | -0.2 | 125.4 |
| 2017-2019  | 29.0% | 8.8% | 10.0% | 0.2 | 159.8 |
| 2018-2020  | 30.0% | 16.8% | -4.0% | 0.2 | 178.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 57.0% | 16.8% | -16.0% | 0.2 | 215.1 |
| 2020-2022  | 34.0% | 50.4% | 23.0% | 0.2 | 229.7 |
| 2021-2023  | 23.0% | 50.4% | 5.0% | 0.4 | 222.1 |
| 2022-2024  | -27.0% | 50.4% | -49.0% | 0.3 | 205.2 |
| 2023-2025  | -24.0% | 50.3% | -65.0% | 0.2 | 203.8 |


**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $149.67
* **Last Market Price:** $148.61 (a decrease of $0.71)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $149.44
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $149.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $147.92

The price is slightly below the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a mild short-term downtrend.  It's above the 60-day moving average, indicating longer-term support. The recent drop of $0.71, while not dramatic, points to a potential short-term correction.


**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.44 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 54.56 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.02 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum, but weak)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +4.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** 5.1% (long-term, relative to the S&P 500)

The indicators present a mixed picture.  The relatively low PPO suggests the bullish momentum may be weakening.  The positive relative divergence suggests a temporary short-term uptrend despite the recent price drop.  The 5.1% expected return, while positive, needs to be considered in light of the significant underperformance compared to the S&P 500 observed over the last two years.


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows some fluctuation in EPS and revenue.  There's a notable dip in Q1 2024. Further analysis would be needed to determine the causes of these fluctuations.  The seemingly duplicated entry for 2024-10-08 needs clarification.


| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출 (B$) |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 2024-10-08 | 2.13 | 23.32      |
| 2024-07-11 | 2.24 | 22.50      |
| 2024-04-23 | 1.49 | 18.25      |
| 2023-10-10 | 2.25 | 23.45      |
| 2024-10-08 | 2.25 | 23.45      |


**5) Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability show a strong and stable performance, with the exception of a dip in Q1 2024.  Capital and profitability figures suggest a generally healthy financial position, although ROE fluctuates considerably.


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $27.78B | 52.56% |
| 2024-09-30 | $23.32B | 55.42% |
| 2024-06-30 | $22.50B | 55.92% |
| 2024-03-31 | $18.25B | 54.81% |
| 2023-12-31 | $27.85B | 52.97% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity (B$) | ROE |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $18.04     | 8.44% |
| 2024-09-30 | $19.45     | 15.06% |
| 2024-06-30 | $19.45     | 15.85% |
| 2024-03-31 | $19.05     | 10.72% |
| 2023-12-31 | $18.50     | 7.04% |


**6) Overall Analysis:**

PEP's recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500, despite generally healthy financial fundamentals. While the company shows solid revenue and profitability, the stock price has underperformed the market significantly in the last two years.  The technical indicators present a mixed signal, and the 5.1% projected long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500 needs to be viewed cautiously in light of recent underperformance.  Further investigation into the causes of the Q1 2024 earnings dip and the significant negative CAGRs in the last two years is needed before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated data entry also requires clarification.
