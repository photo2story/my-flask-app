## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The cumulative return for PEP is 33.89%, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) which had a cumulative return of 117.62%.  The difference is a substantial -83.7%, placing it at the 0th percentile of its historical performance range relative to the S&P 500.

The provided Alpha/Beta analysis shows varying CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over different periods, ranging from a high of 53% to a low of -27%, highlighting significant volatility. The consistently low Alpha (around 0.1) suggests PEP's performance is largely tracking the market, with limited outperformance. The relatively low Beta values suggest lower than average market volatility.  However, the recent negative CAGR is concerning.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $146.27
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $149.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $154.05
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $161.47

The stock is trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, indicating a downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 19.53 (Significantly oversold, suggesting potential for a bounce, but also vulnerability)
* **PPO:** -0.27 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Strength Divergence:** -2.6 (Short-term bearish divergence)
* **Expected Return:** -679.4% (This extremely negative figure needs clarification. It's likely an error or misinterpretation of the data.  Further investigation is needed to understand this value's calculation and meaning.)

The current price of $146.27 is below all moving averages and coupled with the low RSI and negative PPO, signals a bearish market sentiment.  The extremely low RSI does hint at potential oversold conditions and a possible bounce, but the broader trend remains bearish.  The negative expected return requires further investigation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some inconsistencies (duplicate entry for 2024-10-08).  Focusing solely on the unique data points:

* **Revenue:** Fluctuates across quarters, with a noticeable decline in Q1 2024 ($18.25B) compared to previous quarters. The most recent quarter shows a recovery to $23.32B. There's no clear consistent upward or downward trend.
* **EPS:** Shows some volatility, with a decline from Q2 2024 ($2.24) to Q1 2024 ($1.49). The most recent quarter saw a recovery to $2.13.  Again, no clear consistent trend.
* **Comparison:** Without expected earnings data, it's impossible to determine if the results "beat" or "missed" expectations.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue shows some volatility, with the highest revenue observed in Q4 2023. Profit margins are relatively stable, hovering around 55%, though showing some slight fluctuation between quarters.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity is relatively stable, with minor fluctuations. ROE (Return on Equity) exhibits more volatility, suggesting varying profitability over the reported periods.  The high ROE in several quarters suggests PepsiCo is using its equity effectively.

The financial information reveals some volatility in revenue and ROE.  Long-term financial health will require further data points and analysis.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.

The earnings data shows some volatility in both revenue and EPS, but no clear long-term trends are easily discernible from the limited data.  The financial information highlights stable profit margins and some volatility in ROE.  Further information is needed to assess recent news and market outlook to provide a more comprehensive assessment.  The extremely negative expected return requires urgent clarification and further investigation.  More data, particularly longer-term trends and comparison against analyst expectations, is needed for a more robust analysis.
