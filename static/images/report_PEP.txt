**5. Financial Statements Analysis:**

(There appears to be a labelling discrepancy in the provided data.  The table labelled "Revenue and Profitability" shows profit margins significantly exceeding revenue figures which is not possible.   The equity figures in the "Capital and Profitability" section also seem unexpectedly stable.  This data needs review for accuracy before a robust financial analysis can be conducted).  Further investigation into the accuracy of these figures is needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn.

**8. Overall Analysis:**

PepsiCo (PEP) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period measured.  While some technical indicators (RSI, divergence) hint at a potential short-term rebound, the longer-term trend suggests underperformance.  The recent financial data requires additional context (analysts' estimates) for a robust evaluation.  The accuracy of the provided financial statements should be verified before further analysis.
