*   **Change:** -0.47
*   **5-day SMA:** 150.338
*   **20-day SMA:** 147.8452
*   **60-day SMA:** 146.742

*   **PPO:** 0.2029 (Positive, but low - indicating potential for further movement)

*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 5.3 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term Increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -161.8%

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium level of investment risk. RSI is neutral. The PPO indicates the price is slightly increasing. The Hybrid Signal is recommending a "Buy." The recent positive change in relative divergence suggests a recent short-term increase. The exceptionally low expected return (negative) is a significant concern, indicating a potential for large negative return if invested long-term from this point.

    *   Some articles suggest potential for PepsiCo ("Best Stock to Buy", "Passive-Income Investors Buy Before 2026").
