## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

This report analyzes PepsiCo Inc. (PEP), a global food and beverage company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo's cumulative return of 44.76% significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return of 122.19% over the measured period.  The difference is -77.4%, placing it at the 0th percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently around 0.2 suggests that the stock's performance has been marginally better than would be expected based solely on its beta (market risk exposure). However, this marginal outperformance is dwarfed by the S&P 500's overall gains.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $157.79
* **5-day Moving Average:** $159.55
* **20-day Moving Average:** $160.35
* **60-day Moving Average:** $166.65

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The relatively small difference between the averages suggests a mild downtrend rather than a sharp decline.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.67 (Slightly above neutral, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** 0.095 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum, though weak)
* **20-day Relative Strength Change:** -1.9% (Indicates recent weakness)
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% (This is a statement of the current expected return and not an assumption about future performance.  The model uses current market data to make this determination)


The current price of $157.82 is close to the reported closing price, so no significant price jumps (sharp increase or decrease) need to be highlighted. The 0.0% expected return reflects the past underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and current market conditions. This does not imply that future performance will remain flat; it is a statement reflecting the historical context of the data provided.  Long-term (2+ years) investment with regular contributions could potentially mitigate some of the underperformance risk.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility.  Revenue fluctuates considerably from quarter to quarter, although in general, the last two years show consistent revenue numbers.  EPS also shows variability, with the highest EPS in Q2 2024 and lower figures in Q1 2024 and Q4 2023. The data lacks context (analyst expectations) which would be needed for a full assessment of beats or misses.  However, the provided data does reveal inconsistent performance in reported earnings.

* **Equity:** Equity is relatively stable, although there is some quarter-to-quarter variation.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** ROE shows substantial fluctuation, suggesting variability in the company's efficiency in using shareholder equity to generate profit. The high ROE in some quarters is offset by lower figures in others.
