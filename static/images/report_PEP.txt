**1. Performance Comparison:**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a global food and beverage company producing a wide range of products.  Over the analyzed period, PEP significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), showing a substantial negative return difference of -90.9%. This places its performance at the 0th percentile relative to the historical range of its underperformance against the S&P 500.  The provided alpha and beta analysis shows mixed results, with alpha varying significantly between periods,  suggesting inconsistency in outperformance relative to the market (beta).  While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance), others display negative alpha, indicating underperformance. The high negative alpha in the most recent periods indicates substantial underperformance against the market.


**2. Recent Price Action:**

The current price of PEP ($143.39) is below its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The proximity of the price to the 5-day MA suggests that the downtrend may be moderating slightly, but confirmation is needed.


**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI of 25.20 indicates that PEP is currently in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce. However, the negative PPO (-0.17) and the negative relative divergence point to continued bearish momentum in the short term. The significant negative expected return (-770.6%) suggests substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 is expected in the long term, which needs further investigation to determine the source of this prediction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |

| 2024-10-08 | $2.13 | $23.32 Billion |

There's a discrepancy in the October 8th, 2024 data entry.  EPS and revenue figures fluctuate, but a clear trend is not readily apparent from this limited dataset. More data points are necessary for a comprehensive earnings analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a thorough financial analysis.  Further data is crucial for understanding PEP's profitability and financial health.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  While the oversold RSI suggests potential for a short-term rebound, the negative PPO and relative divergence, coupled with the substantial price being below its moving averages and a significantly negative long-term expected return, paints a bearish picture. The lack of comprehensive financial data hinders a deeper analysis.  Before making any investment decisions, thorough investigation into the reasons for the significant underperformance and securing complete financial data is essential.  The -770.6% expected return is particularly concerning and requires more detailed justification.
