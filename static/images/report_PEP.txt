## PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) Stock Review

**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) is a multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation.  The provided data shows PEP's cumulative return is significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last day in the dataset is -75.3%.  This places PEP in the 3.3rd percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided min/max range.


**Alpha & Beta Analysis:**

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis indicates that PEP has consistently shown a positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), albeit modest (around 0.2),  across various periods.  The beta remains consistently around 0.2, suggesting low volatility relative to the overall market.  However, the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) fluctuates significantly, highlighting periods of strong growth alongside periods of decline, especially the significant -27% CAGR in 2022-2024.  Market capitalization (Cap(B)) has generally increased over time.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $151.47
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $155.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $158.71
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $164.32

The stock price is currently below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 23.25  - This indicates the stock is in oversold territory, suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** -0.28 - A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +0.2 - Short-term upward movement.
* **Expected Return:** 0.0% -  The provided 0% expected return is concerning and needs further clarification, especially given the long-term investment horizon. A 0% expected return suggests no outperformance relative to the market over the 2-year timeframe.  This needs further investigation. Given the current price is below moving averages and the negative PPO, a 0% expectation may be overly optimistic. This analysis should be reviewed with a greater understanding of the underlying model used to project this expectation.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility. While revenue generally remains strong (except for Q1 2024), EPS fluctuates considerably.  There's no clear consistent trend in either revenue or EPS growth, and no contextual information to assess whether these figures met or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows fluctuation, with a significant drop in Q1 2024.  Overall, however, PEP consistently maintains considerable revenue in the billions of dollars.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins remain relatively consistent, generally above 50%, with some slight quarter-to-quarter variation.
* **Equity & ROE (Return on Equity):** Equity is relatively stable. ROE fluctuates significantly indicating variations in the company's profitability relative to its shareholder equity.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No news or recent market outlook, analyst opinions, or performance highlights are provided.  This is crucial missing information for a comprehensive analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

PEP's performance lags behind the S&P 500 significantly. While the company shows consistent revenue, EPS and ROE fluctuate. Technical indicators suggest the stock is oversold, potentially signaling a short-term rebound. However, the long-term outlook is unclear due to a lack of market outlook information and the concerning 0% expected return.  The significant negative CAGR observed in the most recent period (2022-2024) raises serious concerns about the company's future performance.  Crucially, the absence of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a full assessment of the current market sentiment and future prospects.  Further investigation is required into the provided 0% expected return to understand the basis of this prediction and its validity given the present indicators.

**8. Recommendations:**

Due to the significant underperformance relative to the market, the unclear long-term growth outlook (especially in light of the recent negative CAGR), and the lack of key information such as recent news and analyst opinions, a thorough review of PEP's fundamentals and future market expectations is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The provided 0% expected return needs additional justification, and the lack of explanation around the reported data makes a full, reliable analysis impossible.
