The current closing price is $268.32, slightly down from the previous close of $269.16 (-$0.31).  The stock is trading below its 5-day ($273.99), 20-day ($275.34), and 60-day ($294.68) moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The Market Risk Indicator (MRI) of 0.42 suggests a low to medium risk level.  The RSI of 47.57 is close to the neutral level (50), indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The PPO of 0.41 suggests a potential bullish momentum, although this needs to be considered alongside other factors. The recent relative divergence of -2.5 points towards short-term bearish pressure. The -0.31 change in price from the previous close is a minor downward movement, and doesn't suggest a significant event.
