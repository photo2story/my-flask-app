* **5-Day Moving Average:** $263.65
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $282.93
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $304.80

The stock is trading below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downtrend.  The recent price drop of -$0.84 suggests some downward pressure but doesn't represent a dramatic shift.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 29.12 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +7.5% (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** 43.9% (Long-term, relative to S&P 500)

The combination of a high MRI, low RSI, and negative PPO indicates a relatively high-risk profile, and while the recent price action suggests short term upward potential, the overall picture remains cautious. The relatively high expected return is encouraging for long-term investors.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Eaton Corporation PLC (ETN) has demonstrated strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500.  However, current technical indicators suggest a potentially bearish short-term outlook. The company's financial health appears solid, with stable revenue and healthy profit margins.

Further investigation into the duplicate earnings data entry and the recent downward price movement is recommended before making any investment decisions.  Consideration of macroeconomic factors and industry trends would also enhance the analysis.
