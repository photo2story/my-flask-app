## Eaton Corporation PLC (ETN) Investment Review

This report analyzes Eaton Corporation PLC (ETN), a power management company providing energy-efficient solutions.  The analysis incorporates historical performance, recent price movements, technical indicators, financial statements, and projected returns.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Eaton's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500.  The provided data shows a cumulative return of 308.81% for ETN versus 116.43% for VOO.  The difference is 192.4%, placing it at the 83.6th percentile of the historical maximum and minimum divergence between the two.  This suggests strong historical outperformance.

The CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) from the provided table also indicates superior returns for ETN across multiple periods, ranging from 20% to a remarkable 199% in the 2023-2025 period.  However,  it's crucial to note that higher CAGRs are often associated with higher maximum drawdown (MDD), as seen in the later years. The relatively consistent beta of 0.3 suggests lower volatility compared to the overall market. The alpha consistently above zero indicates outperformance relative to the market benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 345.14
* **5-day Moving Average:** 342.04
* **20-day Moving Average:** 339.83
* **60-day Moving Average:** 352.52

The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a relatively positive short-term trend.  However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term pullback from a higher price level.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 54.27 – Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions, indicating a neutral momentum.
* **PPO (Price Oscillator):** 0.34 – A positive value suggests upward momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.4 – Indicates a slight weakening in the recent relative outperformance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** 27% – This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) outperformance against the S&P 500, assuming consistent historical trends.  However, future returns are never guaranteed.  The current price of 345.14 doesn't suggest any extreme price movement (sudden surge or crash) based on the provided data.
