**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:**  ETN is projected to have a strong Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 98.0% over the 2024-2026 period. This indicates a high potential for growth.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of 80.4% is substantial. This means that from peak to trough, the investment could lose a significant portion of its value. This high MDD suggests high volatility and risk.
