More detailed financial statement analysis and analyst forecasts are necessary for a thorough evaluation.

News and analyst sentiment regarding the long-term outlook will further inform the investment decision.  The current indicators suggest a cautiously optimistic view, but further due diligence is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions. The expected return of 10.95% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500 is promising but dependent on maintaining its competitive advantage and favorable economic conditions.
