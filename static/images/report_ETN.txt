* **20-day Moving Average:** $273.54
* **60-day Moving Average:** $292.84

The price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The recent price drop of $3.3 (from $268.32 to $259.47) might be contributing to this bearish trend.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4082 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 45.12 (Approaching oversold territory, but not decisively so)
* **PPO:** 0.1467 (Positive, but relatively low, suggesting weak momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -5.8% (Short-term downtrend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, >2 years):** 64.2%  (This represents an expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 over the long term.)

The combination of a medium risk indicator, RSI approaching oversold levels, and negative relative divergence suggest a potential short-term downturn. However, the positive PPO and high long-term expected return should be considered. The significant recent price drop warrants further investigation into potential underlying market factors.
