Eaton's cumulative return (327.24%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (120.40%).  The raw difference is 206.8%, placing it at the 89.3rd percentile of historical divergence based on the provided min/max range.  This indicates strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided CAGR data further supports this consistent outperformance over various periods.
