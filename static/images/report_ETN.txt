## Eaton Corporation PLC (ETN) Investment Report

This report analyzes Eaton Corporation PLC (ETN), a power management company providing energy-efficient solutions worldwide.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Eaton's cumulative return (323.26%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (121.78%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 201.5%, placing it at the 87.2nd percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong outperformance, but the relative percentile should be considered in context of the historical volatility of this relative performance.

The provided CAGR data further supports this strong outperformance, consistently exceeding the implied S&P 500 returns.  The alpha consistently shows positive excess returns above the market (Beta = 0.3 indicating lower than average market sensitivity).  However, note that past performance is not indicative of future results.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $355.15
* **Last Market Price:** $349.20
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $358.04
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $367.59
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $350.63

The stock price is currently below its 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bearish trend.  However, it's above its 60-day moving average, implying potential support.  The significant difference between the last market price and closing price suggests a potential event impacting price (further information needed to assess).

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (27.29):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.88):** Negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-4.5%):**  Shows a recent short-term decline.

The reported expected return of 156.7% over a long-term (2+ years) horizon relative to the S&P 500 is extremely high and should be treated with significant caution.  This projection needs further validation and should not be solely relied upon for investment decisions.  The substantial difference between the closing price ($355.15) and the last market price ($349.20) requires investigation to understand the cause and its potential impact on future performance.
