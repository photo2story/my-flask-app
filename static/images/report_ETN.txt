|------------|------|---------------|
| 2024-10-31 | 2.54 | 6.34 B$       |
| 2024-08-01 | 2.49 | 6.35 B$       |

| 2023-10-31 | 2.23 | 5.88 B$       | *(Duplicate Entry)*


Revenue has shown slight growth. EPS fluctuates.  More data points are needed for a conclusive trend analysis.  The duplicate entry for 2023-10-31 suggests a data error which needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a thorough financial analysis.  This is a critical data gap.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

ETN has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500.  However, recent price action and technical indicators (PPO, moving averages) suggest a potential short-term downward trend. The high expected long-term return is promising, but the lack of crucial financial data (revenue, gross profit) and potential data errors hinder a comprehensive assessment. Further investigation into the missing financial data and the duplicate earnings entry is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The high historical alpha and strong revenue growth signals potential but requires a deeper dive into the financial statements and a careful consideration of the current market environment.  It is recommended to consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decision.
