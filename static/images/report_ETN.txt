Eaton Corporation PLC (ETN) has shown significantly higher returns than the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  Positive Alpha values consistently suggest outperformance. However, the high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to a short-term correction.  While the long-term outlook, supported by a positive expected return and strong financial indicators (profit margins and ROE), appears promising, investors should monitor the RSI closely and consider diversification to mitigate risk.  Further investigation into the quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in EPS and Equity would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the company's performance.
