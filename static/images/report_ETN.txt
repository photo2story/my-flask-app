## Eaton Corporation PLC (ETN) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:** Eaton Corporation PLC, a power management company, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods. While recent price action shows a decline, strong historical CAGR, and positive financial indicators suggest long-term potential. However, current RSI and PPO levels indicate oversold conditions, warranting caution.

**1) Performance Comparison:**

Eaton Corporation PLC's cumulative return (250.13%) drastically exceeds the S&P 500's (118.31%).  The current divergence of 131.8 points sits at the 59.7th percentile of the historical divergence range (max: 233.8, min: -19.1).  This highlights significant outperformance relative to the broader market, but this also indicates the potential for regression towards the mean.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows consistently positive alpha values across all periods, indicating that Eaton has generated returns above what would be expected based on its beta (market risk exposure). Beta values fluctuate between 0.2 and 2.7, suggesting varying levels of market sensitivity throughout the observed periods.  Market capitalization also shows a steady increase.
