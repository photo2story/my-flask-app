## Eaton Corporation PLC (ETN) Investment Report

This report analyzes Eaton Corporation PLC (ETN), a power management company specializing in electrical components and systems.  The analysis is based on the provided data and does not incorporate external information beyond what's given.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Eaton's cumulative return (296.13%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (115.96%) over the measured period. The difference is 180.2%, placing it at the 78.8th percentile of historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided range.  This indicates strong relative performance. The provided alpha consistently above zero further supports this outperformance.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $332.38
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $337.28
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $353.12
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $352.13

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend in the short-term.  This is consistent with the negative relative divergence.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (19.64):** Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is due.
* **PPO (-0.76):** Shows a negative momentum, aligning with the downward trend observed in the moving averages.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-2.3):**  Confirms a short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (29.9%):**  Suggests a significant potential for outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming current trends continue. The current price of $332.38, being below the moving averages, doesn't necessarily indicate a dramatic price movement (sudden surge or crash) but rather a consolidation or potential further decline before a potential rebound given the oversold RSI.
