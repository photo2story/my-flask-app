*   **Divergence:** -75.4 (Relative Divergence: 0.8)

**Analysis:** Aave has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The large negative divergence indicates a substantial difference in returns. The very low relative divergence suggests the performance is near the worst observed in the historical range considered.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR     | MDD     | Alpha     | Beta   | Cap(B) |
|------------|----------|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -31.0%   | 79.7%   | -20.0%    | -0.1   | 0.8    |
| 2021-2023  | -267.0%  | 79.7%   | -269.0%   | -0.0   | 1.7    |
| 2022-2024  | 82.0%    | 79.7%   | 61.0%     | -0.0   | 4.7    |
| 2023-2025  | -33.0%   | 73.6%   | -100.0%   | 0.0    | 2.3    |

*   **CAGR:** Highly volatile returns, ranging from -267% to 82%, indicating a high-risk investment.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high drawdown (around 80%), showing substantial potential losses.
*   **Alpha:** Generally negative or much lower than expected (except 2022-2024), indicating underperformance relative to a benchmark index.
*   **Beta:** Beta is close to zero. This suggests that the security's price is not very correlated with the overall market.
*   **Cap:** Ranging 0.8 - 4.7.

**2. Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Current Price:** 148.87
*   **Last Market Close:** Price: 148.87, Previous Close: 149.30, Change: -0.28
*   **5-day SMA:** 151.45
*   **20-day SMA:** 173.33
*   **60-day SMA:** 186.46

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all three moving averages, indicating a downtrend. The 5-day SMA is closest to the current price, suggesting a possible short-term stabilization, but the gap between the 20-day and 60-day SMAs and the current price signifies continued downward pressure.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended) - _Note: This seems contradictory to other indicators and should be treated with skepticism given the other data._
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 25.14 (Oversold)
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -1.42 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (6 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** 0.8 (+) 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Price Fluctuation:** {'price': 148.87259, 'previousClose': 149.29749, 'change': -0.28}
*   **Expected Return:** 308.1% (Excess return compared to S&P 500, long-term)

**Analysis:** The RSI indicates the asset is oversold, potentially suggesting a possible short-term bounce. However, the negative PPO confirms the bearish momentum.  The "short-term rise" divergence comment needs to be viewed cautiously in the broader context of negative trends. The high "Expected Return" should be heavily discounted, given the volatility and recent underperformance. The MRI suggesting "High Investment Recommended" is questionable and should be viewed with extreme caution.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Negative News:**  The news headlines are mixed but generally lean negative. "Aave falls 18% over week," "Aave Price Slips Below $300" are clear indicators of recent price weakness.
*   **Tax Rules (Potentially Positive):** "UK’s new tax rules could trigger crypto boom, says Aave CEO" offers a potential positive catalyst, but it's speculative.
*   **Technical Analysis:** "Aave Finds Key Support At $268" suggests a level to watch for potential stabilization (but this level has clearly been breached).
*   **Rebounds & Buyback Optimism:** "Aave Price Rebounds As Bullish Structure Strengthens On Buyback Optimism" and "Most Influential: Stani Kulechov" provide some positive notes, but are older than the more recent negative headlines.

**4-2. Analyst Opinions**

*   Analyst Consensus: No data provided.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Aave (AAVE-USD) is currently exhibiting significant weakness. It has substantially underperformed the S&P 500, and its price is trending downward, sitting below key moving averages. The RSI suggests it is oversold, which could lead to a temporary bounce, but the overall momentum, as indicated by the PPO, remains bearish.

Recent news is largely negative, highlighting price declines. While there are some older headlines about potential positive catalysts like tax rules and buyback optimism, the immediate outlook appears challenging.

The "Expected Return" figure should be treated with skepticism. The MRI of 0.9 ("High Investment Recommended") contradicts much of the other data and should not be relied upon.

**Overall Recommendation (Based on Provided Data):** Given the negative performance, downtrend, negative news flow, and high volatility, a **cautious** approach is warranted. The oversold RSI might offer a short-term trading opportunity, but a long-term investment at this point carries significant risk. Further research and due diligence are strongly advised.
