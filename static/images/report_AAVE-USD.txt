2026-01-02 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a breakdown and analysis of the AAVE-USD data provided, compared against the S&P 500 (VOO).

**1) Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO)**

*   **Ticker:** AAVE-USD (Aave)
*   **Overview:** Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies.
*   **AAVE Cumulative Return:** -20.45%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 56.39%
*   **Divergence:** -76.84%
*   **Divergence (Range):** Min: -79.7, Max: 383.1, Current: -78.1
*   **Relative Divergence:** 0.3

**Analysis:** Aave has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period considered.  The negative divergence (-76.84%) shows a wide gap in performance. The relative divergence of 0.3 indicates that the current divergence is very close to the minimum divergence observed in the analyzed period. This suggests that while performance is poor, it is near the lowest point relative to the S&P 500 within the analyzed timeframe.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2021-2023  | -64.0% | 85.1% | -92.0% | 2.1 | 1.7 |
| 2022-2024  | 96.0% | 79.8% | 66.0% | 2.2 | 4.7 |
| 2023-2025  | 76.0% | 79.8% | 8.0% | 1.8 | 2.2 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** Shows large swings in annual growth, indicating high volatility.
*   **MDD:**  High Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures across all periods confirm significant downside risk.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is a measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis. This means that Alpha takes the risk (volatility) of a security and compares its risk-adjusted performance to a benchmark index.
*   **Beta:**  Beta consistently above 1 indicates higher volatility than the market (S&P 500). In other words, AAVE is more sensitive to market movements than the overall market.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 148.69
*   **Last Market Data:** {'price': 148.69, 'previousClose': 146.11, 'change': 1.76} (Slight positive change)
*   **5-day SMA:** 149.37
*   **20-day SMA:** 165.09
*   **60-day SMA:** 180.29

**Analysis:** The stock price is below all three Simple Moving Averages (SMA), indicating a recent downtrend. The 5-day SMA is closest to the current price, while the 60-day SMA is furthest away, suggesting the downtrend is relatively recent.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return**

*   **MRI:** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 30.23 (Oversold)
*   **PPO:** -0.77
*   **Hybrid Signal:** "cash_0%_Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90) Monthly invest 1.6% of total investment ($1,000.00) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-01)"
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -0.7 (Negative - Short-term Decline)
*   **Price Change:**  {'price': 148.69, 'previousClose': 146.11, 'change': 1.76} - Positive change, reflecting a potential rebound.
*   **Expected Return:** 0.0% (Expected excess return compared to S&P 500 if invested long-term)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** Despite the overall performance, the MRI indicates medium to high investment potential.  This could be influenced by factors not fully captured in the recent price data.
*   **RSI:** The RSI suggests that the asset may be oversold, potentially indicating a buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests the short-term moving average is trending below the long-term moving average.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The signal suggests buying now with a specific allocation strategy, reflecting the MRI's relatively positive outlook.
*   **Recent Divergence Change:** The negative change confirms the short-term downward trend.
*   **Expected Return:** The 0.0% expected return compared to the S&P 500 suggests the analysis does not see strong alpha generation from AAVE over the long term, despite the oversold condition and potentially higher market risk.

**5) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Aave has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The price is in a downtrend, trading below its key moving averages. The RSI indicates an oversold condition, which can indicate a potential price reversal, but negative divergence changes and the negative PPO confirm current downward momentum. AAVE demonstrates much higher volatility than S&P 500, and the company's recent CAGR and MDD is high risk, high reward.

Recent news reveals the inherent volatility and risks within the DeFi space, as exemplified by the flash crash. While news of potential benefits from UK tax rules and the overall tokenization trend are positive, they do not outweigh the near-term negative price action. The lack of analyst consensus data is a critical gap.

**Overall:**  AAVE presents a high-risk, high-reward investment. The potential upside may come from a broader crypto market recovery, increased adoption of DeFi, and specific positive developments for Aave. However, the volatility, underperformance, and risks highlighted in the news should give investors pause. The "Buy" signal based on MRI should be viewed with caution, as it may not fully reflect the recent price action and underperformance relative to the market. A more informed decision would require analyst consensus data and a deeper understanding of the specific catalysts for Aave's future growth.
