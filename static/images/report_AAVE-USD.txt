|------------|---------|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| 2020-2022  | -31.0%  | 79.7%  | -20.0%  | -0.1 | 0.8   |

| 2023-2025  | 4.0%    | 73.6%  | -57.0%  | 0.0  | 3.4   |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) varies significantly, reflecting high volatility.  Negative CAGRs in 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 indicate substantial losses during those periods. The 2022-2024 period shows a strong positive CAGR, but the 2023-2025 period is more modest.
*   **MDD:**  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high across all periods, indicating significant risk and price volatility.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha is a measure of the investment's performance on a risk-adjusted basis.  Negative alpha values suggest that Aave has underperformed relative to its risk-adjusted benchmark in most periods except for 2022-2024.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are close to zero or negative, suggesting Aave's returns are not strongly correlated with the overall market (S&P 500).
*   **Cap(B):** The market capitalization fluctuates, indicating changes in investor sentiment and market conditions.

**2. Recent Price Movement**

*   **Current Price:** 218.387
*   **Last Market Data:**
    *   Price: 224.063
    *   Previous Close: 214.928
    *   Change: 4.25
*   **5-Day Moving Average:** 221.932
*   **20-Day Moving Average:** 260.107
*   **60-Day Moving Average:** 290.216

The recent price increase suggests a short-term positive trend. However, the current price is still below the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential ongoing correction or consolidation phase. The positive change in the Last Market Data confirms a recent upward movement.

**3. Market Risk Indicators & Expected Return**

*   **Expected Return:** 156.1% (Long-term, vs. S&P 500)

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI suggests a "Low Investment" recommendation, reflecting moderate risk.
*   **RSI:** The RSI value indicates that Aave might be oversold, potentially signaling a buying opportunity.
*   **PPO:** The Negative PPO indicates a downtrend.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The Hybrid Signal is giving a strong buy signal.
*   **Relative Divergence Change:** The negative change in relative divergence suggests a short-term downtrend relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The high expected return (156.1% over S&P500) suggests significant potential upside from current levels for long-term investors.

**4. Recent News & Significant Events**

The provided news headlines are mostly unrelated to Aave or cryptocurrencies directly. They cover general finance, geopolitical risks, and economic anxieties. The gold price increase due to tariff threats could indirectly benefit cryptocurrencies as investors seek alternative assets.

*   **Gold Hits Record High As Trump's Tariff Threats Send Investors Racing To Safety**: This may reflect a broader risk-off sentiment that could spill over into crypto markets, although gold is a more traditional safe haven.
*   **Polymarket Airdrop Farmers Have Become 'More Sophisticated':**  Indicates ongoing activity and development in the broader DeFi space, which could indirectly impact Aave.

**5. Overall Analysis**

Aave (AAVE-USD) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 recently, with a current absolute divergence of -35.9%. While the recent price movement shows a short-term positive trend, it's still below key moving averages.

The Market Risk Indicator suggests caution, while the RSI indicates a potentially oversold condition. The negative PPO suggests a downtrend, although the hybrid signal indicates a buy signal. The high expected return (156.1% over S&P 500) suggests significant potential upside for long-term investors, provided they can tolerate the inherent volatility.

**News Considerations:**

The general economic and geopolitical uncertainty (reflected in headlines about gold and potential tariffs) could impact investor sentiment toward risk assets like cryptocurrencies. The news about Polymarket indicates ongoing activity and evolution within the DeFi space, which could have indirect positive effects on Aave.

**Recommendation:**

Given the oversold RSI and high long-term expected return, Aave might present a speculative buying opportunity for investors with a high-risk tolerance and a long-term investment horizon. However, the underperformance relative to the S&P 500 and negative short-term trends suggest caution. Investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance and conduct further research before making any investment decisions.
