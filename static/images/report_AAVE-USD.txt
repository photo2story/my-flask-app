**0. Report Overview**

This report provides an analysis of Aave (AAVE-USD) stock, comparing its performance against the S&P 500 (VOO). It covers return rates, volatility, moving averages, risk indicators, recent news, and potential future performance.

**1. Return Rate Comparison**

*   **Company Overview:** Aave is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies.
*   **Aave Cumulative Return:** -14.46%
*   **S&P 500 (VOO) Cumulative Return:** 55.96%
*   **Divergence:** -60.7 (Relative Divergence: 1.2)

**Analysis of Return Rate:**

Aave has significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The negative cumulative return indicates a loss for Aave investors during the period, while the S&P 500 has shown substantial gains. The divergence of -60.7, with a relative divergence of only 1.2, suggests that Aave's performance is very close to the minimum historical divergence from the S&P 500.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

|            |  CAGR |  MDD | Alpha   | Beta | Cap(B) |
| :--------- | :---- | :--- | :------ | :--- | :----- |
| 2020-2022  | -31.0% | 79.7% | -20.0%  | -0.1 | 0.7    |

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):** Shows inconsistent performance. High growth in 2022-2024 is offset by significant losses in other periods.
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** Consistently high MDD values (around 80% or close to) indicate significant volatility and risk.
*   **Alpha:**  Large negative alpha values, particularly in 2021-2023 and 2023-2025, suggest significant underperformance compared to the benchmark. A positive alpha in 2022-2024 is an outlier.
*   **Beta:** Beta values close to zero indicate low correlation with the market, which explains how Aave can diverge so far from the S\&P 500.
*   **Cap(B):** Variable capitalization with high volatility.

**Analysis of Alpha, Beta:**

The Alpha and Beta analysis suggests that Aave has been a risky and underperforming asset relative to the market. The high MDD values and negative Alpha figures indicate that Aave has generated lower returns than expected for the level of risk undertaken. The Beta values close to zero indicate low correlation with the market, which explains how Aave can diverge so far from the S\&P 500.

**5. Comprehensive Analysis**

Aave has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, indicating a high-risk investment with substantial negative divergence.
