*   **Downtrend:** The recent price action and negative PPO point to a short-term downtrend.
*   **Market Volatility:** The broader market is experiencing significant volatility due to tariff concerns, as reflected in the news headlines. This increased market risk could amplify the volatility of Aave.
*   **Alpha, Beta Analysis:** Shows highly variable performance and risk.

**Recommendation:**

Given the current market conditions, recent underperformance, and short-term downtrend, a cautious approach is advised.

Monitor the situation closely and consider a smaller initial position to mitigate potential downside risk. Pay close attention to future news and market developments.
