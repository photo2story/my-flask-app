The negative 20-day relative divergence change (-0.7) shows a recent short-term downtrend.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS      | 매출         |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| 2024-10-23 | 1.12     | 22.47 B$     |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.95     | 22.45 B$     |
| 2024-05-01 | 1.35     | 21.38 B$     |
| 2024-02-16 | 1.68     | 21.39 B$     |
| 2023-10-27 | 10.32    | 21.35 B$     |

EPS shows significant volatility.  The October 2023 EPS is exceptionally high compared to subsequent quarters, requiring further investigation into potential accounting or reporting anomalies. Revenue remains relatively stable.


**5. Financial Information:**

No "Total Revenue" or "Gross Profit" data is available.  This lack of crucial financial information significantly hampers a comprehensive analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the observed period, displaying a substantial negative return difference. While some technical indicators show moderate bullishness, the extremely negative projected long-term return and lack of crucial financial data raise serious concerns.  The volatile EPS figures and absence of key financial data (Total Revenue, Gross Profit) prevent a conclusive assessment.  Further investigation into the October 2023 EPS anomaly and the acquisition of complete financial statements is crucial before making any investment decisions. The -302% expected return suggests that based on the available data, JNJ is not a promising investment compared to the S&P 500, especially for a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy.
