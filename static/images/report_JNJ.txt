**0. Executive Summary:**

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a leading healthcare company, has shown a cumulative return significantly lower than the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  While exhibiting relatively stable profitability, recent performance indicates underperformance against the market benchmark.  Further investigation is needed to determine if this underperformance is temporary or indicative of a longer-term trend.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

**6. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ's recent performance lags behind the S&P 500. While the company shows consistent revenue and high profit margins, the significant negative expected return (-64.7%), inconsistent EPS, and high beta suggest substantial market risk. The volatile EPS data requires further investigation.  Technical indicators suggest a possible short-term rebound, but the long-term outlook needs a more in-depth analysis considering the inconsistent alpha, high MDD values, and the negative expected return figure.  The -64.7% expected return, in particular, needs clarification as it seems excessively negative and inconsistent with the other financial metrics. Before making any investment decisions, more research is needed to understand the drivers behind the company's underperformance and the justification for such a dramatically low expected return.
