## Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock Performance Review

**0. Executive Summary:**

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a leading healthcare company, has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly over the analyzed period. While exhibiting stable profitability, recent performance indicators suggest a potentially undervalued state, warranting further investigation into long-term investment prospects.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is a multinational corporation that manufactures and sells medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.

* **JNJ Cumulative Return:** 39.26%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 104.98%
* **Return Difference:** -65.7%
* **Relative Divergence:** 28.4% (This indicates JNJ's performance is relatively lower than the S&P 500, but not at its historical worst level considering the provided min/max values.)


The provided Alpha and Beta analysis reveals inconsistent performance relative to the market (S&P 500).  While periods of positive alpha (outperformance) exist, the recent trend (2021-2025) shows negative CAGR and a declining alpha, indicating underperformance.  The high beta values consistently suggest a higher sensitivity to market fluctuations than the overall market.  Note that the provided data lacks context on the risk-free rate used to calculate the Alpha.

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 34.0% | 0.0% | 6.0% | -0.1 | 275.3 |
| 2016-2018  | 11.0% | 10.8% | -7.0% | 0.2 | 261.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 21.0% | 10.8% | -9.0% | 0.7 | 303.6 |
| 2018-2020  | 11.0% | 10.8% | -16.0% | 0.4 | 336.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 28.0% | 8.1% | -43.0% | 0.4 | 374.9 |
| 2020-2022  | 17.0% | 8.1% | 8.0% | 0.4 | 397.3 |
| 2021-2023  | -10.0% | 6.2% | -34.0% | 0.4 | 363.2 |
| 2022-2024  | -24.0% | 8.6% | -57.0% | 0.3 | 345.7 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $163.63
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $163.35
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $164.55
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $153.94

The price is slightly below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, and significantly above the 60-day moving average. This suggests a recent short-term pullback after a period of upward movement.  The recent price change of $0.37 (from $163.02) is not significantly large enough to be considered a dramatic jump or drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.42 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 36.23 (Suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, indicating potential for a rebound.)
* **PPO:** -0.49 (Negative value suggests bearish momentum.)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** -0.3 (Indicates a short-term bearish trend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -73.4% (This significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 needs further clarification.  The methodology for this calculation is critical to understanding its validity.)

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue        |
|------------|--------|----------------|

| 2023-10-27 | $10.32 | $21.35B        |

Earnings show some volatility.  The significant jump in EPS in Oct 2023 requires investigation to understand the underlying reasons (e.g., one-time gains, accounting changes).  Revenue has remained relatively consistent, although a slight decline is visible from Q2 2024 onward.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ's financial fundamentals (revenue, profitability, and equity) appear relatively strong and stable. However, its stock price performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 significantly.  The negative expected return (-73.4%) relative to the S&P 500 is a major concern and requires detailed explanation of the calculation methodology.  The recent short-term pullback could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors *if* the reasons for underperformance are addressed (e.g., are there temporary factors influencing the negative expected return, or is there a deeper underlying issue?).   Further investigation into the volatile earnings figures and the methodology behind the expected return calculation is crucial before making any investment decisions.  A deeper dive into JNJ's specific business segments, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is recommended.
