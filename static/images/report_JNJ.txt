The relative deviation of 16.7 suggests this underperformance is near the lower end of its historical range compared to VOO.

*   **Analysis:** The MRI suggests a low-risk environment for the overall market. The RSI of 45.52 is neutral, not indicating overbought or oversold conditions. The positive change in relative deviation suggests recent improvement in JNJ's performance relative to the S&P 500, but from a low base. Given the change of 0.22 is negligible and the very negative "Expected Return", the data suggests very cautious review.

**7. Overall Summary**

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.
