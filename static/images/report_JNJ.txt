**7. 종합적으로 분석**

**Summary & Recommendation**

Johnson & Johnson faces a complex situation.

*   **Positives:** The stock is currently in an upward trend, trading above its moving averages, and analysts maintain a "Buy" consensus. The Market Risk Indicator suggests a medium level of investment risk. Recent earnings showed good revenue.
*   **Negatives:** JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, and the negative expected return (despite dollar-cost averaging) is a major red flag. The talc lawsuit liabilities are a significant overhang, and the RSI indicates the stock may be overbought.  The declining profit margins and fluctuating ROE are also concerning.
*   **Key Issue:** The legal risks associated with the talc lawsuits are the primary driver of uncertainty and negative sentiment.

**Recommendation:** While analysts have a positive outlook, **caution is advised.** The legal liabilities and negative expected return outweigh the positive technical indicators. Given the significant underperformance and legal challenges, it might be prudent to **avoid** JNJ for now until there is more clarity on the talc litigation and a more positive long-term outlook. The "Hybrid Signal" suggests a small allocation, which is in line with the cautious approach given the medium risk indicated by the MRI. However, the negative expected return should be the primary consideration.
