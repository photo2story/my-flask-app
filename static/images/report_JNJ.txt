**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate):**  CAGR fluctuates significantly, showing periods of strong growth (e.g., 2019-2021, 2023-2025) and periods of decline (e.g., 2021-2023, 2022-2024).
*   **MDD (Maximum Drawdown):** MDD has been relatively consistent, suggesting moderate risk exposure, although MDD is not related to Beta.
*   **Alpha:** Alpha, representing excess return relative to a benchmark, is negative in many periods, particularly in recent years. This reinforces the underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Beta:** Beta steadily decreases over time, indicating that JNJ's price movements are becoming less correlated with the overall market and less sensitive to market fluctuations. The low Beta values (0.1 recently) suggest JNJ is behaving more like a defensive stock.
*   **Cap(B) (Market Capitalization):** Market Cap has generally increased, with the most recent value being significantly higher, despite some periods of decline.
*   The negative alpha in recent years suggests that JNJ has underperformed relative to what would be expected based on its beta.
