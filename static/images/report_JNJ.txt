**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출       |
|------------|------|------------|
| 2025-10-22 | 2.14 | 23.99 B$   |
| 2025-07-24 | 2.3  | 23.74 B$   |
| 2025-04-23 | 4.57 | 21.89 B$   |
| 2024-10-23 | 1.12 | 22.47 B$   |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue is relatively stable. EPS fluctuates but has improved over the last few quarters of 2025, potentially indicating improving profitability.  Note the duplicate entry for 2025-10-22 with different EPS.  This would need clarification to be properly analyzed. Assuming the 1.12 is from the previous year, 2024-10-23, there's significant growth in EPS YoY.

*   **Analysis:** Revenue is steadily increasing. Profit margins are high and stable.  Equity has been increasing, but it is not clear the source of it from this data. ROE fluctuates, with a significant spike in Q1 2025, but has been declining from there.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

JNJ has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  Its Beta is consistently below one and is decreasing. Technical indicators suggest it is neither overbought nor oversold, with a slightly negative PPO. Analyst consensus is a "Buy," with target prices above the current level. Recent news highlights ongoing talc lawsuit concerns, offset somewhat by positive developments in cancer drugs and institutional investment. Earnings have improved in recent quarters, but the duplicated data entry for EPS raises questions. Revenue and profit margins remain strong, though the recent ROE is declining.

**Overall Assessment:**

*   **Caution is warranted.** While analyst ratings are positive, the stock's underperformance relative to the market, coupled with a low expected return, suggests other investment opportunities might be more compelling.
*   **Monitor Legal Issues:** The talc lawsuits are a key risk factor and should be closely watched.
*   **Watch for EPS clarification and trends:** An error was identified in EPS so a deeper look into Earnings data is warranted before investing.
*   **Valuation:** The fact that it is a mixed bag suggests it is not over or undervalued, and is a fair assessment of the company at the current time.
