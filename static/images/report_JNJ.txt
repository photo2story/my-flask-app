## Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock Performance Review

**0. Overview:**

Johnson & Johnson is a multinational corporation that develops and manufactures medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

JNJ's cumulative return is 24.15%, while the S&P 500's (VOO) is 66.94%.  This represents a significant underperformance of -42.8 percentage points.  The relative underperformance, considering historical volatility, places JNJ at the 35.8th percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500 (-76.4% to +17.5%).

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis across several years shows mixed results.  While some years exhibit positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), indicating stock-specific strength, others show significantly negative CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate), suggesting underperformance. The beta consistently hovers around 0.0-0.7, indicating a relatively low correlation to market movements, but in recent periods, negative CAGR values reflect underperformance even with relatively low market beta.  Market capitalization remains consistently large, ranging from $261.2B to $397.3B during the analyzed period.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $150.97
* **5-day moving average:** $152.93
* **20-day moving average:** $159.725
* **60-day moving average:** $157.1119

The price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend. The recent price increase (0.65) relative to the previous close shows a minor uptick, but it's not sufficient to reverse the overall downward trend evidenced by the moving averages.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 34.14 (Below 30, indicating oversold conditions)
* **PPO:** -1.01 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** +6.8 (Short-term upward movement)
* **Expected Return:** -49.6% (Significantly negative, suggesting considerable underperformance relative to S&P 500 expectations over a 2+ year horizon)

The high MRI, low RSI, and negative PPO all point towards a bearish outlook.  While the short-term relative divergence shows some upward movement, the overall picture remains negative, particularly concerning the significant negative expected return. The 0.65 price increase is a minor fluctuation within a larger negative trend.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  While the company boasts high profit margins and relatively stable revenue,  recent earnings show substantial EPS volatility, raising concerns.  Technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook, further supported by a significantly negative expected return relative to the S&P 500.  The current price is below key moving averages, indicating a potential downward trend.  Further investigation is needed into the causes of the EPS volatility and the persistently negative projected return before making any investment decisions.  The low beta suggests lower risk, but the overall underperformance and negative outlook outweigh this factor.
