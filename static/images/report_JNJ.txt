## Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Overview & Key Figures:**

Johnson & Johnson is a multinational corporation that manufactures medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.  The following analysis utilizes provided data to assess JNJ's performance.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **JNJ Cumulative Return:** 41.69%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 108.99%
* **Return Difference:** JNJ underperformed VOO by 67.3 percentage points.  The relative underperformance, considering historical volatility, places JNJ in the 27.2nd percentile (meaning it's underperformed the S&P 500 more often than not, based on the provided historical range).

The Alpha and Beta analysis shows mixed results across different periods. While JNJ exhibited positive Alpha (outperformance relative to the market) in several periods, it also shows periods of negative Alpha and significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in the most recent period (2021-2024). The Beta consistently remains around 0.0-0.7. This indicates relatively low sensitivity to market fluctuations which, in most circumstances, suggests a relatively stable investment. However, it did not prevent the company from underperforming compared to S&P 500 in the recent years.  The market capitalization remains consistently high, indicating a large-cap company.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $165.42
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $164.91
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $158.60
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $149.92

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term upward trend. However, the recent price change indicates a slight downturn (-1.11%).


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 71.78 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term price correction).
* **PPO:** 0.32 (Positive value suggests upward momentum, but a moderate one).
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +5.4% (Indicates recent short-term upward momentum).

The significant negative expected return of -75.1% is concerning and warrants further investigation.  This prediction implies substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). Given the data, the outlook does not suggest a long-term outperformance with JNJ compared to S&P 500.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ's performance has significantly lagged the S&P 500 in recent years. While the company maintains strong revenue and profit margins, the recent negative price movement, approaching overbought RSI, and the projected significantly negative long-term return relative to the S&P 500 raise concerns. The volatility in EPS needs further investigation.  Before making any investment decisions, it is crucial to conduct thorough due diligence and consider the potential risks associated with this underperformance.  The substantial negative expected return (-75.1%) relative to the S&P 500 should be a major factor in any investment strategy.  Further research is needed to understand the reasons behind the recent underperformance and the exceptionally high EPS in October 2023.
