*   The negative PPO value confirms the downward trend.
*   The negative change in relative divergence reinforces the short-term downward momentum.

*   **Last Market Note:** The significant positive change in the last market data {'price': 148.82, 'previousClose': 146.36, 'change': 1.68} suggests a potential for increased volatility and a possible short-term rebound, but it's crucial to monitor whether this trend continues or reverses.
