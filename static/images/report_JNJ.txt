**0. Executive Summary:**

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a multinational healthcare corporation, has shown a cumulative return significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period. While exhibiting relatively stable profitability, recent performance indicates a potential underperformance compared to the broader market, warranting further investigation into the underlying factors.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has a cumulative return of 39.48%, significantly lower than the S&P 500's (VOO) return of 117.28%.

The high negative Alpha in the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024 periods requires further investigation.

* **5-Day Moving Average:** $159.72
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $155.19
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $149.82

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend, although the relatively high RSI (see below) might indicate an overbought condition.  The recent price change of $0.88 represents a relatively small increase, suggesting a lack of significant recent volatility.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 77.90  (High, suggesting overbought conditions)

* **Expected Return:** -126.6% (This exceptionally negative figure requires clarification. Itâ€™s likely miscalculated or representing an unusual scenario that needs further explanation.)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be nearing a potential correction.  The positive PPO aligns with the short-term upward trend indicated by the relative divergence. However, the extremely negative expected return needs immediate investigation and clarification to understand its implication for long-term investment strategy.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ shows strong financial fundamentals with consistent revenue and high profit margins. However, its stock price performance has significantly lagged behind the S&P 500 in recent periods, highlighted by a negative Alpha in several years.  The high RSI suggests an overbought condition, and the extremely negative expected return needs to be clarified.  Further investigation is necessary to understand the reasons for the significant EPS fluctuation and the substantial underperformance relative to the S&P 500, particularly focusing on the periods with negative Alpha.  A deeper dive into industry-specific factors, company-specific news, and macroeconomic conditions is crucial for a complete analysis before making any investment decisions.  The -126.6% expected return needs immediate re-evaluation as it is implausible.
