*   **RSI:** 85.49 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.3333

*   **Expected Return (%):** -56.9%

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI of 0.9 suggests a moderately high level of investment recommendation.
    *   The RSI of 85.49 indicates that the stock is overbought and may be due for a correction or pullback.
    *   The negative change in relative divergence (-6.4) indicates a short-term decline in performance compared to the S&P 500.
    *   The significantly negative Expected Return of -56.9% suggests that, based on the model used, JNJ is projected to underperform the S&P 500 significantly over the long term if purchased at this point.
    *   The Hybrid Signal of "Buy 100% of cash" despite the negative expected return is contradictory and should be treated with caution, as it might be based on different factors like the MRI (high).

*   **Positive News:**
    *   New EU Drug Approval, Oncology Deal, and Positive 2026 Outlook
