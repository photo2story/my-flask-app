## Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a leading healthcare company, has underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) significantly.  While JNJ's cumulative return is 21.64%, VOO's is 117.62%. This results in a large negative divergence of -96.0, placing it at the 3.4th percentile of the historical range of divergence between the two.  The provided data shows consistently low alpha values, indicating that JNJ's returns haven't significantly outperformed the market's broad returns, as represented by the S&P 500, after considering its beta.

**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $143.66
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $143.97
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $145.61
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $153.76

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.46 -  Approaching oversold territory (below 30 would typically be considered oversold), suggesting potential buying opportunity, but not definitive.
* **PPO:** 0.15 - A positive value indicates that the 12-period moving average is above the 26-period moving average suggesting a bullish trend. However, this needs to be interpreted in context of the price action and other indicators.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** -0.5 -  Indicates a recent weakening in JNJ's performance relative to the market.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -790.1% - This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is highly unusual and warrants further investigation.  It's crucial to understand the methodology used to calculate this figure.  It is very likely an error or that it is using an unusual calculation that doesn't reflect reality.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows inconsistent EPS and revenue.  There is no clear upward trend in either metric.

* **EPS:** Fluctuates significantly between quarters, with a surprisingly high EPS of $10.32 in Q4 2023, considerably higher than other quarters.  This spike requires further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.
* **Revenue:**  Revenue has remained relatively stable, fluctuating around $21-22 billion.  However, there's no consistent growth trend.  More historical data is necessary to establish a clear trend.
* **No Beats or Misses:**  The analysis cannot determine if there were any beats or misses against expectations without additional context (such as analyst estimates).

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue is relatively stable, while profit margins remain consistently high (around 69%), indicating strong profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity fluctuates, and ROE shows significant variance, particularly a very high ROE of 36.54% in Q3 2023.  This requires further investigation to determine the underlying reasons.  Overall, the capital and profitability data are inconsistent and require further exploration to draw meaningful conclusions.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Earnings News (Last 2 days):**  This information is not provided.
* **Recent Market Outlook:**  This information is not provided.
* **Analyst Opinions:** This information is not provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ's recent performance has been significantly weaker than the S&P 500.  While profitability margins remain strong, there's no clear trend of revenue growth, and EPS shows significant volatility.  The provided data reveals inconsistencies and anomalies (e.g., the extraordinarily high EPS in Q4 2023 and ROE in Q3 2023) that require additional investigation to fully understand the company's financial health and performance.  The extremely negative projected return relative to the S&P 500 is highly questionable and requires clarification on the calculation methodology.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a comprehensive assessment.  The current technical indicators suggest a potential oversold condition, but further analysis is needed.  More detailed historical data and context (analyst expectations, market conditions, etc.) are crucial for a more thorough and accurate analysis.
