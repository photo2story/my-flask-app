**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the last two days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which were not provided in the initial prompt.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ has underperformed the S&P 500 significantly.  While the stock is currently in oversold territory (RSI), the negative PPO and the recent drop in EPS raise concerns.  Revenue is relatively stable, and profit margins remain strong.  However, the volatile EPS and inconsistent ROE require further scrutiny to understand underlying drivers. The lack of information regarding recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more complete assessment.  The projected 0% expected return suggests that JNJ is unlikely to significantly outperform the S&P 500 in the long term based on the current data.  Further analysis, including investigation into the factors influencing the volatile ROE and the significantly lower Q3 2024 EPS, and incorporating current market sentiment and news, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
