A cautious approach is warranted. While the hybrid signal suggests buying, the long-term underperformance, overbought conditions, and analyst target price being below the current price warrant caution. It is crucial to consider individual risk tolerance and investment goals before making any decisions. Consider waiting for a pullback before initiating a new position, or averaging down if already invested, while remaining aware of the potential for continued underperformance compared to the broader market.
