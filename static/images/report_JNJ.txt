## JNJ (Johnson & Johnson) Stock Analysis

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500:**

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a global healthcare company, significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO). JNJ's cumulative return is 25.16%, while VOO's is 120.85%, resulting in a difference of -95.69%.  The Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests JNJ is currently undervalued compared to its historical performance against the S&P 500.  The provided alpha and beta analysis consistently shows negative alpha, indicating JNJ has underperformed its benchmark over various periods.  This underperformance is substantial and warrants further investigation.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

JNJ's closing price is $146.41.  Short-term momentum appears weak, with the price below its 5-day ($145.95), 20-day ($150.82), and 60-day ($156.10) moving averages. This suggests a recent downtrend.

**3. RSI, PPO, and Expected Return:**

* RSI: 25.17 indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, suggesting a potential buying opportunity.
* PPO: -0.317 suggests weakening momentum.
* Relative Strength Delta:  A positive change of 1.2 over the last 20 days suggests a slight improvement in relative performance against the S&P 500, although the overall trend remains negative.
* Expected Return: 0.0% suggests JNJ is not expected to outperform the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

* **Latest Quarter Comparison:** Revenue remained relatively flat between Q2 2024 ($22.45B) and Q3 2024 ($22.47B). EPS decreased significantly from $1.95 in Q2 2024 to $1.12 in Q3 2024.
* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue has shown slight growth over the past year, from $21.35B in Q3 2023 to $22.47B in Q3 2024.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS has been volatile, with a significant drop in the most recent quarter. The high EPS in Q3 2023 ($10.32) likely represents a one-time event or accounting adjustment, as it doesn't align with the trend. Excluding Q3 2023, the trend shows declining EPS.
* **Beats/Misses:** Without analyst expectations data, it's impossible to determine if these results represent beats or misses.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue has seen modest growth, while profit margins have remained relatively stable around 69%.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  ROE has fluctuated significantly.  The exceptionally high ROE in Q3 2023 (36.54%) requires further investigation, as it's an outlier and likely due to a non-recurring event.  Excluding this, ROE appears to be trending downwards. Equity has remained relatively stable.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

Information on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions is required for a comprehensive analysis. Please provide this data for a more complete assessment.

**7. Overall Summary:**

JNJ is currently underperforming the S&P 500 significantly.  While the recent price drop and oversold RSI might suggest a potential buying opportunity, the declining EPS, weakening momentum (PPO), negative alpha, and lackluster expected return raise concerns. The high EPS and ROE in Q3 2023 need further investigation to determine their underlying cause and whether they represent sustainable performance.  Further information on recent news, analyst opinions, and market outlook would be beneficial to form a complete investment thesis.


**8. Recommendation:**

Based on the available information, it's difficult to recommend JNJ as a strong buy. Further investigation into the drivers behind the declining EPS and the anomalous Q3 2023 results is necessary.  Consider waiting for more information and analyzing the upcoming earnings releases before making an investment decision.  A thorough understanding of the company's recent news and analyst sentiment is crucial for a well-informed investment strategy.
