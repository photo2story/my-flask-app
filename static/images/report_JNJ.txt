### 7. 종합적인 분석 (Overall Analysis)

JNJ is currently showing mixed signals. While its recent price action is positive, driven possibly by recent news events, its long-term performance relative to the S&P 500 is significantly lagging. The technical indicators show a low-risk environment but an approaching overbought condition. Financials demonstrate strong profitability but varying EPS figures. The most concerning point is the significantly negative expected return, suggesting substantial potential for long-term underperformance.

**Recommendation:** Cautious. While the recent uptrend is encouraging, the long-term underperformance and negative expected return warrant caution. Closely monitor upcoming earnings and news events to reassess the outlook. The Hybrid Signal suggests a partial buy, but a full position should be avoided until more positive signals emerge.
