* **20-day Moving Average:** $152.58

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (34.18):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.17):** A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** A positive change of 0.2 indicates a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  The projected long-term (2+ years) excess return relative to the S&P 500 is currently estimated at 0%. This is likely a result of the historical underperformance. Given the current market situation, further information (e.g., risk-free rate) is needed to fully justify this expectation. Note that there's no explicit mention if this accounts for the risk.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and relatively flat revenue.

* **EPS:**  EPS has varied considerably quarter-to-quarter, with a significant spike in Q3 2023 ($10.32) that's likely an outlier and needs further investigation.  Without context of the previous year, determining trends is inaccurate.

* **Revenue:** Revenue remains relatively stable around $21-22.5 billion, suggesting slight growth but no significant upward trends are easily discernible from the limited data provided.

* **Beats/Misses:**  No information on earnings expectations is given. Therefore, it is impossible to determine whether the results were beats or misses.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue has remained relatively stable, while profit margins show slight fluctuation, generally remaining above 68%.

* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity fluctuates, and ROE varies widely, reaching an exceptionally high value of 36.54% in Q3 2023 which necessitates investigation into underlying reasons.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news or market outlook information is provided. Analyst opinions and performance highlights are also missing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period, indicated by a large negative divergence.  While technical indicators (RSI) suggest potential for a short-term bounce, the negative PPO and consistently negative alpha suggest bearish momentum. Recent earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and stable revenue, though further investigation is needed into the exceptionally high ROE and Q3 2023 EPS to fully understand the company's financial health. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits a comprehensive assessment.  The 0% expected return is also dependent on numerous factors, and should be critically evaluated. Without access to additional data, providing a definite buy/sell recommendation is inappropriate.


**8. Conclusion:**

Further investigation is required to fully assess JNJ's current investment viability. Analyzing the Q3 2023 EPS and ROE outliers, obtaining missing earnings expectations data, and incorporating recent news and analyst sentiment are crucial steps.  Investors should carefully consider these factors alongside a broader portfolio strategy before making any investment decisions.
