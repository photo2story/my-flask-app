Equity has fluctuated, with a noticeable decrease in the quarter ending 2023-12-31.

Further investigation is needed to ascertain cause.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the provided timeframe. While the RSI suggests potential for a short-term bounce due to extreme oversold conditions, the negative PPO and downward trend in relative strength indicate continued bearish momentum.  Earnings show a recent decline in EPS, despite relatively stable revenue.  The significant volatility in ROE necessitates additional investigation.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits a comprehensive market outlook.  Overall, the data suggests JNJ is currently a risky investment, with a neutral to negative long-term outlook relative to the S&P 500 based on past performance. More data is required for a complete assessment.
