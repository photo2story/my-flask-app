*   **Negative Alpha:** Consistent negative alpha indicates underperformance relative to its benchmark.
*   **Talc Lawsuit Headwinds:** Ongoing legal challenges related to talc lawsuits continue to weigh on investor sentiment.

**Conclusion:**

While JNJ possesses strong financial fundamentals and analyst support, the significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500, the drag from talc lawsuits, and the concerningly low expected return raise red flags. Investors should carefully weigh these factors before considering an investment in JNJ. The recent short-term upward trend and oversold RSI could present a temporary buying opportunity, but the long-term outlook appears uncertain. It is important to consider whether the company can successfully navigate its legal challenges and return to a path of sustainable growth.
