## Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a diversified healthcare company, based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Johnson & Johnson's cumulative return (36.58%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (128.31%). The difference is -91.73%, placing it at the 2.29th percentile of its historical range of relative performance compared to the S&P 500 (-94.28% to 17.07%).  This indicates JNJ's considerable underperformance relative to the broader market over the analyzed period.

The provided CAGR data shows varying performance over different periods, with some years significantly outperforming the S&P 500 and others lagging considerably.  The Beta consistently hovered around 0.7, suggesting a moderate correlation with the market. Alpha values generally positive but decreasing in recent years which indicate underperformance compared to the market benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $155.78 (Last Market: $155.76)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $154.51
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $156.07
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $160.98

The price is currently below its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential short-term bearish trend.  The 5-day MA being below the price suggests some recent upward momentum.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI (41.86):** Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially indicating a bounce back.
* **PPO (0.14):**  A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-3.84):** Shows a recent decrease in relative strength.

The relatively low RSI coupled with a positive PPO signals potential for a short-term recovery.  However, the negative relative divergence suggests this recovery may be short-lived.  The price being close to the last market close ($155.76) doesnâ€™t show any evidence of a rapid price movement (either surge or crash).

The expected return is 0.0%, indicating that at the current moment there's no expected excess return compared to the S&P 500 given the long-term investment horizon of at least two years.

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue data shows some fluctuations.  The October 2024 EPS is significantly lower compared to the previous quarters.  Further information, particularly regarding the earnings expectation for the October 2024 quarter would allow for a more comprehensive analysis.  A comparison with analyst expectations is crucial for a complete evaluation of the company's recent performance.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Shows consistent high profit margins (around 69%) with stable revenues in the range of $21-$22.5 billion per quarter.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Equity and ROE show variability across quarters, but generally healthy levels.  The exceptionally high ROE in Q3 2023 (36.54%) warrants further investigation to determine if it reflects a one-time event or represents a significant change in the company's profitability.

The information from recent news, analyst opinions, and market outlooks are critical for a more informed decision-making process.
