2025-12-28 - Analysis Report
Okay, here's a comprehensive analysis of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) based on the provided data, broken down into sections as requested.

**1) Return Rate Comparison (JNJ vs. VOO)**

*   **Company Overview:** Johnson & Johnson is a global healthcare conglomerate focused on pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health products.
*   **JNJ Cumulative Return:** 60.02%
*   **VOO Cumulative Return:** 103.21%
*   **Divergence:** -41.8 (Relative Divergence: 28.9)

**Analysis:** JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the tracked period.  The cumulative return is substantially lower, resulting in a divergence of -41.8%.  The relative divergence of 28.9% suggests that the current divergence is closer to the minimum divergence observed in the past, meaning it's not as far below the S&P 500 as it *could* be, but still significantly lagging.

**Alpha, Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 26.0% | 66.8% | -2.0% | -0.1 | 336.6 |
| 2016-2018  | 14.0% | 10.7% | -1.0% | 0.1 | 310.9 |
| 2017-2019  | 20.0% | 71.5% | -2.0% | 0.4 | 351.4 |
| 2018-2020  | 19.0% | 79.2% | -4.0% | 0.4 | 379.2 |
| 2019-2021  | 33.0% | 79.2% | -14.0% | 0.5 | 412.2 |
| 2020-2022  | 8.0% | 79.6% | 9.0% | 0.4 | 425.6 |
| 2021-2023  | -19.0% | 79.6% | -20.0% | 0.3 | 377.6 |
| 2022-2024  | -32.0% | 79.6% | -53.0% | 0.3 | 348.4 |
| 2023-2025  | 31.0% | 79.6% | -37.0% | 0.1 | 500.2 |

**Analysis:**

*   **CAGR & MDD:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) shows periods of both strong growth and significant decline.  Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is consistently high, indicating substantial volatility and risk during those periods.
*   **Alpha:**  Alpha is mostly negative, suggesting JNJ has generally underperformed its benchmark (likely the S&P 500, used for beta calculation). The negative alpha indicates JNJ did not generate excess returns relative to the risk-free rate and benchmark.  The 2020-2022 period is an exception, showing positive alpha.
*   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low (close to 0.1 ~ 0.5), indicating that JNJ's price movements are less sensitive to changes in the broader market (S&P 500). This is typical for a stable, large-cap company.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Close:** 207.63
*   **Last-Market:**  Price: 207.63, Previous Close: 207.78, Change: -0.07
*   **5-day SMA:** 206.98
*   **20-day SMA:** 206.68
*   **60-day SMA:** 197.41

**Analysis:**  The stock is currently trading slightly below its previous close.  The 5-day and 20-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) are clustered around the 206-207 level, indicating short-term price consolidation. The 60-day SMA is significantly lower, suggesting an upward trend over the past two months, despite the recent short-term stability.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 1.0 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 59.29
*   **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.34
*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 90% of cash (1 shares - Safe - MRI:0.80) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-03)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** -5.1 (short-term decline)
*   **Expected Return:** -59.0%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The high MRI suggests a favorable overall market environment for investment *generally*, but this doesn't guarantee JNJ's performance specifically.
*   **RSI:** An RSI of 59.29 indicates that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum.
*   **PPO:** The negative PPO suggests that the short-term moving average is below the long-term moving average, indicating a potential downtrend, though the value is close to zero.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal suggests to buy with a focus on safety, aligned with the high MRI.
*   **Divergence Change:** The recent decline in relative divergence confirms the underperformance compared to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The very negative expected return (-59.0%) is concerning and needs careful consideration. This suggests the model anticipates continued underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a longer-term horizon.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Eczema Drug Trial Halt (Quiver Quantitative):** News about a potential drug trial halt can introduce uncertainty and potentially negatively impact the stock price.
*   **Stock Drops Despite Market Gains (Yahoo Finance):**  Reinforces the underperformance relative to the broader market.  Highlights factors to consider, which would be important to research further.
*   **Johnson & Johnson Stock Today (ts2.tech):** Focuses on the impact of the talc verdict, drug-price pressure, and Q4 earnings.  These are significant overhangs on the stock.
*   **Bar Harbor Wealth Management Sells Shares (MarketBeat):** Institutional selling can put downward pressure on the stock price.
*   **Shares Surging This Month (Motley Fool - old news):** This is conflicting with other news, suggesting recent positive momentum might be fading or specific to the previous month.
*   **What to Know Before the Market Opens (ts2.tech):**  Another reminder of the negative impacts to Johnson and Johnson from external and internal factors.

**Analysis:** The news flow paints a mixed, but largely negative, picture.  The eczema drug trial halt, continued focus on talc verdicts, and general market underperformance are significant concerns.  The article about shares surging from a previous month provides limited short-term benefit.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (Mean: 2.16)
*   **Opinions:** 24
*   **Target Price:** Avg: 209.29, High: 240.00, Low: 155.00
*   **Recent Rating Changes:** No changes provided

**Analysis:** The analyst consensus is still "Buy," despite the recent challenges. However, the average target price of 209.29 is only slightly above the current price, suggesting limited upside potential. The wide range between high and low target prices reflects uncertainty among analysts.

*   **Concerns:** The primary concerns revolve around the talc litigation, drug-pricing pressures, and potential impacts from drug trial issues.
