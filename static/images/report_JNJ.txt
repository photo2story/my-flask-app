    *   **CAGR:** The Compound Annual Growth Rate fluctuates, showing periods of strong growth (e.g., 2019-2021) and significant declines (e.g., 2022-2024).
    *   **MDD:** The Maximum Drawdown is consistently high, indicating significant volatility and potential for large losses.
    *   **Alpha:** Alpha is mostly negative, suggesting JNJ has historically underperformed its benchmark after accounting for risk.  The recent negative Alpha values are particularly concerning.  The period 2020-2022 shows a positive Alpha, which is an outlier in the data.
    *   **Beta:** Beta values are generally low (around 0.1 to 0.5), suggesting JNJ is less volatile than the overall market. A Beta of 0.5 indicates that, theoretically, for every 1% move in the S&P 500, JNJ tends to move 0.5% in the same direction.
    *   **Cap(B):** Market capitalization has generally increased over time, reflecting the company's overall growth, but it also experiences fluctuations.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations:**

*   **Current Price:** 206.92
*   **Previous Close:** 207.56
*   **Change:** -0.31
*   **5-day SMA:** 206.22
*   **20-day SMA:** 196.2387
*   **60-day SMA:** 188.4013

*   **Analysis:** The stock price is currently slightly down compared to the previous close. The 5-day SMA is above the 20-day SMA, and both are above the 60-day SMA, suggesting a short-term upward trend.  The price is above all moving averages.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis:**

*   **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.9 (High Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI:** 97.04 (Overbought)
*   **PPO:** 0.5229
*   **Hybrid Signal:** Buy 100% of cash (5 shares - Very Safe - MRI:0.90)
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 12.1 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term increase)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -44.8 (Long-term underperformance compared to S&P 500)

*   **Analysis:**
    *   The MRI suggests a high level of investment confidence, which seems contradictory to other indicators.
    *   The RSI is extremely high (above 70 is generally considered overbought), indicating the stock may be due for a pullback.
    *   The PPO indicates the short term moving average is higher than the long term moving average.
    *   The recent increase in relative divergence suggests a short-term upward trend relative to the S&P 500, but the overall expected return is significantly negative.
    *   The negative expected return implies that despite the recent positive momentum, the model predicts JNJ will underperform the S&P 500 over the long term if purchased at this price.
    *   The change in the stock price of -0.31, given the recent upward momentum, is moderate.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events:**

*   **Positive Headlines:**
    *   "J&J Up Around 17% in 3 Months: Should You Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?"
    *   "Johnson & Johnson Stock 13-Day Winning Spree: Stock Climbs 12%"
    *   "1 Reason Why Shares of Johnson & Johnson Are Surging This Month"

*   **Negative Headlines:**
    *   "Johnson & Johnson $JNJ Shares Sold by Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co."

*   **Analysis:** The news sentiment is mixed. While there are several positive articles highlighting the recent stock surge, there's also news of institutional selling, which could indicate a lack of confidence in future growth potential. The comparative article suggests investors are also considering alternatives like Pfizer.

**4-2) Analyst Opinions:**

*   **Consensus:** Buy (~2.16 on a 1-5 scale)
*   **Opinions:** 24
*   **Target Price (avg/high/low):** 201.67 / 230.00 / 155.00

*   **Analysis:** Analyst consensus is generally positive (Buy rating). However, the average target price of $201.67 is *below* the current price of $206.92, suggesting limited upside potential according to analysts. The high target price of $230 suggests some analysts see significant upside, while the low target of $155 suggests considerable downside risk. Recent rating changes are not provided.

**5) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS  | 매출     |
|------------|------|----------|
| 2025-10-22 | 2.14 | 23.99 B$ |
| 2025-07-24 | 2.3  | 23.74 B$ |
| 2025-04-23 | 4.57 | 21.89 B$ |
| 2024-10-23 | 1.12 | 22.47 B$ |
| 2025-10-22 | 1.12 | 22.47 B$ |

*   **Analysis:** Revenue has been relatively consistent in the last few quarters, with a slight increase. EPS, however, has fluctuated more significantly, particularly the jump in 2025-04-23 to 4.57. There's a duplicate entry for 2025-10-22 with different figures (2.14 and 1.12) which need to be clarified.  The data suggests potentially inconsistent earnings performance despite steady revenue.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary):**

*   **Mixed Signals:** JNJ presents a complex picture. The stock has experienced a recent surge, fueled by positive news and short-term technical indicators, as reflected in the recent 5-day SMA exceeding the 20-day and 60-day SMAs and increase in relative divergence change. However, fundamental analysis reveals concerns.

*   **Underperformance:** JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period analyzed and the expected return is negative, suggesting this trend may continue. Alpha is generally negative.

*   **Overbought Condition:** The extremely high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought and due for a correction.

*   **Analyst Caution:** While the analyst consensus is a "Buy," the average target price is *below* the current price, indicating limited upside and potential overvaluation.

*   **Financial Strengths:** JNJ maintains strong revenue, high profit margins, and growing equity, which are positive indicators. However, earnings per share (EPS) and ROE have fluctuated considerably.

*   **Recommendation:** Based on this analysis, a cautious approach is warranted. While the recent positive momentum might be tempting, the long-term underperformance, overbought condition, and negative expected return suggest significant risks.
