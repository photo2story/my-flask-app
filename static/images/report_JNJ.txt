**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

JNJ's cumulative return (37.97%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500's cumulative return (87.98%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -50.0%, placing it at the 27.6th percentile of historical relative performance compared to the S&P 500. This indicates that JNJ's performance has lagged behind the broader market significantly.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and beta (volatility relative to the market) values over the years. While some periods show positive alpha, suggesting outperformance, others exhibit negative alpha indicating underperformance.  Beta values are generally around 0.1-0.4, suggesting lower volatility than the overall market in most years.

The high Maximum Drawdowns (MDD) consistently across years highlight the risk associated with JNJ's stock, demonstrating periods of substantial losses.

* **RSI:** 44.31 (Slightly below the neutral level of 50, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions, leaning towards slightly bearish.)

* **Expected Return:** -70.5% (This is a significant negative value.  It requires further clarification, specifically regarding the methodology used to calculate this value. A long-term (2+ years) investment might mitigate some risk, but this negative expected return suggests substantial uncertainty, especially in comparison to the S&P 500).

The current price movement and indicators suggest a relatively neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook, although confirmation with additional analysis is necessary.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

JNJ's performance has lagged the S&P 500 significantly, displaying substantial underperformance. While the company demonstrates consistent revenue and high profit margins, the recent price action and technical indicators suggest a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook. The highly inconsistent alpha values across different periods highlight variability in performance relative to the market.   The large Maximum Drawdowns indicate considerable risk.  A thorough review of the -70.5% expected return calculation is crucial.  Before making any investment decisions, further investigation is warranted to assess the underlying reasons for the underperformance and the long-term growth prospects of JNJ, considering the inconsistencies in the data provided.  The inconsistent earnings data and the need for clarification of the expected return severely limit a comprehensive conclusion.
