**Analysis of Alpha/Beta Table:**

*   **Alpha:** Consistently negative alpha values (except for 2020-2022) indicate JNJ has generally underperformed relative to its risk-adjusted expected return compared to the S&P 500. The recent years show a particularly sharp decline in alpha, suggesting increasing underperformance.
*   **Beta:** Low beta values (around 0.2-0.7) suggest that JNJ's price is less volatile than the overall market. This is typical for a large, established company in the healthcare sector.
*   **CAGR & MDD:**  The table reveals negative CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) in recent periods alongside high MDD (Maximum Drawdown), highlighting recent challenges in JNJ's performance.  The significant MDD values suggest considerable risk exposure.

*   Current Price: $156.90
*   Previous Close: $157.69
*   Price Change: -$0.5
*   5-Day Moving Average: 156.386
*   20-Day Moving Average: 154.2167
*   60-Day Moving Average: 154.1933

**Analysis:**

The current price is slightly down compared to the previous close.  The 5-day moving average is above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, which suggests a short-term upward trend.  However, the proximity of the 20-day and 60-day averages suggests that the longer-term trend is less definitive.

*   RSI: 81.52 (Overbought)
*   PPO: 0.3

*   20-Day Relative Difference Change: 0.7 (+, Short-term Increase)
*   Expected Return (%): -1008.5%

**Analysis:**

*   **MRI:** The MRI indicates low market risk, suggesting a relatively stable investment environment for JNJ currently.
*   **RSI:**  An RSI above 70 typically indicates an overbought condition, suggesting the stock price may be due for a correction. The current value of 81.52 reinforces this concern.
*   **PPO:** The PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator) value of 0.3 suggests a slight upward trend, but it is not a strong signal.
*   **Hybrid Signal:** The hybrid signal recommends buying 80% of available cash with caution due to a slightly elevated MRI.
*   **Relative Difference Change:** The recent increase in relative difference suggests JNJ is experiencing some short-term improvement relative to the S&P 500.
*   **Expected Return:** The significantly negative expected return (-1008.5%) is highly concerning and suggests a very pessimistic outlook for JNJ compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ year) investment horizon.
*   **Price Change Issue:** The slight negative change of -$0.5 from the previous close doesn't indicate a significant volatility event (no 급반등 or 급하락).
