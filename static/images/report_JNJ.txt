The cumulative return of JNJ (30.48%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (121.09%) over the analyzed period. The provided data shows a substantial lag of -90.6%, placing it at the 7.2nd percentile of its historical range of performance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates consistent underperformance relative to the broader market.  The alpha consistently near zero across the provided years further emphasizes this underperformance relative to the market benchmark.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $152.87
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $150.82
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $146.51
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $149.30

The price is currently above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential pause or consolidation in the longer-term trend.  The recent price change of $1.14 reflects a relatively small positive movement.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 72.77 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.6982 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +6.1% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -364.3% (This extremely negative figure suggests a significant underperformance prediction compared to the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) horizon, possibly due to an error in calculation or misinterpretation of the data. Further investigation is needed to clarify this metric.)

The RSI approaching overbought levels suggests caution, while the positive PPO indicates continued bullish momentum in the short term. The 20-day relative divergence confirms this short-term upward trend.  The highly negative expected return warrants a careful review of the methodology used to generate this forecast.
