## Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Key Figures:**

* **JNJ Cumulative Return:** 29.86%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 119.91%
* **Return Difference:** -90.0% (relative to VOO)
* **JNJ Current Price:** $152.15

**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a global healthcare company that manufactures medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods, significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, lagging by approximately 90 percentage points.  The provided data shows a large negative divergence. While the relative divergence metric suggests a position near the lower bound of historical performance relative to the S&P 500, it is important to consider the alpha and beta values for a complete picture.

The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals mixed results.  While the company showed positive alpha in several periods (indicating outperformance relative to the market), the recent years (2021-2025) show consistently negative alpha coupled with a relatively stable beta (around 0.3-0.4, indicating lower volatility than the market).  The consistently low and occasionally negative alpha suggests that JNJâ€™s stock performance has not significantly exceeded market expectations in recent years. The decreasing market capitalization (Cap(B)) also warrants further investigation.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $152.15
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $151.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $146.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $149.19

The price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting short-term upward momentum. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, implying a potential longer-term bearish trend. The recent price change shows a slight decrease (-$0.47) compared to the previous closing price, which might indicate some short term pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 71.21 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.66 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **Relative Strength Change (20-day):** +5.8% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -338.8% (This exceptionally negative value requires further clarification.  It likely represents a significant underperformance projection relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term horizon, and needs context before interpretation.)

The RSI value suggests the stock might be slightly overbought, hinting at potential near-term correction.  The positive PPO reinforces the short-term upward momentum indicated by the moving averages. However, the substantial negative expected return warrants further investigation to understand its basis and limitations.  The -0.47 change in price is minor and doesn't suggest any significant sudden movements (no indication of sharp upturn or downturn).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-23 | $1.12 | $22.47B     |
| 2024-07-25 | $1.95 | $22.45B     |
| 2024-05-01 | $1.35 | $21.38B     |
| 2024-02-16 | $1.68 | $21.39B     |
| 2023-10-27 | $10.32 | $21.35B     |

The EPS figures show significant volatility, with a major outlier in October 2023. Further investigation is needed to understand the reasons for this fluctuation. Revenue remains relatively stable around $21-22 billion.  The October 2023 earnings likely involve non-recurring factors.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $22.47B    | 69.01%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $22.45B    | 69.40%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.38B    | 69.55%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $21.39B    | 68.23%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $21.35B    | 69.06%        |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE           |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $70.16B    | 3.84%         |
| 2024-06-30 | $71.54B    | 6.55%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $70.02B    | 4.65%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $68.77B    | 5.89%         |
| 2023-09-30 | $71.23B    | 36.54%        |

Both revenue and profit margins are consistently high and relatively stable.  However, the ROE shows significant volatility, with an extreme outlier in Q3 2023 (36.54%).  Investigating the reasons behind this anomaly is crucial.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years. While short-term technical indicators suggest some upward momentum, the long-term outlook appears less optimistic, especially considering the negative alpha and the highly volatile earnings and ROE.  The large negative expected return should be carefully scrutinized for its underlying assumptions and methodology. The highly volatile EPS and ROE figures indicate potential accounting issues or non-recurring events that need to be investigated further before drawing any definitive conclusions about JNJ's financial health and future performance.  A thorough examination of the October 2023 earnings report is strongly recommended.
