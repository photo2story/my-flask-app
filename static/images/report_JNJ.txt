| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $152.15
* **Last Market Price:** $151.78
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $151.89
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $146.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $149.19

The price is slightly below its 5-day moving average, suggesting a recent minor downward trend. However, it sits above both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, indicating a potential upward trend in the longer term.  The small negative change in the last market price (-0.246) does not suggest any significant immediate upward or downward pressure.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 71.21 (Approaching overbought territory, suggesting potential near-term correction)
* **PPO:** 0.66 (Positive, indicating bullish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +5.8% (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -338.8% (This extremely negative figure requires further investigation and clarification.  It is likely an error or misinterpretation of the data, as it implies a significant loss relative to the S&P 500.)

The high RSI suggests the stock might be overbought and prone to a correction.  The positive PPO supports the short-term upward trend. The highly negative expected return necessitates a thorough review of the methodology used to calculate this metric.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the period reviewed. While its financial statements reveal relatively stable revenue and high profit margins,  the inconsistent EPS and ROE, coupled with the negative CAGR in recent years and a highly negative (and likely erroneous) expected return, raise serious concerns.  The recent price movement shows some minor downward pressure, but the stock is above its longer-term moving averages.  The high RSI suggests caution.  Further investigation is crucial to understand the reasons behind the underperformance and the exceptionally high ROE in Q3 2023 and the extraordinarily negative expected return.  The provided data alone is insufficient to make a strong buy or sell recommendation.  A deeper dive into JNJ's financials, competitive landscape, and future prospects is needed.
