## Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a multinational pharmaceutical and consumer goods company, significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for JNJ was 25.49%, while the S&P 500 achieved a cumulative return of 118.37%. This represents a substantial difference of -92.9%, placing it at the 5.2nd percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500 based on the provided data.  The alpha consistently hovers around zero, indicating that JNJ's returns are largely explained by market movements (beta), with limited excess returns.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

As of the latest data point, JNJ's closing price was $147.03.  The stock price shows some recent weakness:

* **5-day moving average:** $145.80
* **20-day moving average:** $144.70
* **60-day moving average:** $150.83

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (54.03):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting neutral momentum.
* **PPO (0.48):** A positive value suggests bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **20-day Relative Divergence (-1.7):** Shows a recent slight decrease in relative performance against the benchmark.

The provided expected return of -510.9% is extremely negative and likely an error.  A more realistic long-term (2+ years) expected return would require a more sophisticated forecasting model considering various economic factors and company-specific risks.  Given the historical underperformance versus the S&P 500, any long-term investment in JNJ should be approached cautiously and with a diversification strategy that includes exposure to broader market indices.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data shows some volatility in EPS:

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-23 | $1.12  | $22.47B       |
| 2024-07-25 | $1.95  | $22.45B       |
| 2024-05-01 | $1.35  | $21.38B       |
| 2024-02-16 | $1.68  | $21.39B       |
| 2023-10-27 | $10.32 | $21.35B       |

The exceptionally high EPS in October 2023 is an outlier requiring further investigation to determine if it reflects an unusual event or accounting adjustment.  Revenue remains relatively stable.


**5. Financial Information:**

The financial information reveals a generally healthy picture, though with some quarterly fluctuations:

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|-------------|------------|---------------|

| 2024-06-30  | $22.45B    | 69.40%        |
| 2024-03-31  | $21.38B    | 69.55%        |
| 2023-12-31  | $21.39B    | 68.23%        |
| 2023-09-30  | $21.35B    | 69.06%        |

Profit margins are consistently high, indicating strong operational efficiency.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity      | ROE           |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30  | $70.16B     | 3.84%         |
| 2024-06-30  | $71.54B     | 6.55%         |
| 2024-03-31  | $70.02B     | 4.65%         |
| 2023-12-31  | $68.77B     | 5.89%         |
| 2023-09-30  | $71.23B     | 36.54%        |

The ROE shows significant variability, with the exceptionally high value in Q3 2023 requiring further investigation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ's recent performance has been underwhelming compared to the broader market. While the company shows strong profitability and stable revenue, the significant underperformance against the S&P 500 raises concerns. The volatile earnings and ROE figures warrant further investigation into potential underlying causes.  Before considering any investment, a thorough analysis of the outlier data points (especially the Q3 2023 EPS and ROE) and a more comprehensive risk assessment are crucial.  The -510.9% expected return is unrealistic and needs correction.  The current price is below its moving averages, indicating a potentially bearish short-term trend.  Long-term investment should be made with caution, considering the historical underperformance and diversifying across multiple asset classes.
