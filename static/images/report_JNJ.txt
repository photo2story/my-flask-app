2024-12-27 - Analysis Report
## Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Johnson & Johnson is a multinational healthcare company that manufactures medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.

The cumulative return of JNJ over the analyzed period is 24.45%, significantly lagging behind the S&P 500 (VOO) which achieved a 120.68% return.  The difference is -96.2%, placing it at the 2.4th percentile of the historical range of the relative difference between JNJ and VOO.  This indicates JNJ's substantial underperformance relative to the broader market.  The provided alpha consistently shows a negative correlation, suggesting underperformance against the market benchmark.  The Beta is not particularly high or low, indicating relatively average market sensitivity.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $145.58
* **5-day Moving Average:** $144.95
* **20-day Moving Average:** $148.248
* **60-day Moving Average:** $154.5541

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The proximity to the 5-day average indicates recent price stability, but further price decline is possible if trend holds.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 36.81 - This suggests the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially indicating a short-term bounce.
* **PPO:** 0.0355 - A positive PPO suggests bullish momentum, albeit weak.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):** -4.6% - Indicates recent weakness relative to the market.
* **Expected Return (Long-Term):** -1121.3% - This extremely negative figure warrants further investigation as this number seems improbable without additional context or calculation details. It may be a severe error and must be scrutinized.  A long-term investment might not match S&P 500 performance given this substantial underperformance in the past and current negative outlook.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent quarterly EPS and revenue.  There's no clear upward trend in either metric.

* **EPS:** Fluctuation is significant, with a high of $10.32 and a low of $1.12.  This irregularity needs further analysis to understand the causes.  There's no consistent pattern of growth or decline observed in the given data.
* **Revenue:** Revenue is relatively stable around $21-22 billion, although it doesn't show a consistent upward growth trend.
* **Significant Change:** The exceptionally high EPS of $10.32 in 2023-10-27 compared to all other reported values requires explanation.  This outlier significantly skews the analysis.

Without further context or more comprehensive data (such as analyst expectations), it's impossible to judge whether any specific quarters "beat" or "missed" expectations.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Revenue remains relatively stable, but no significant growth is observed.
* **Profit Margin:** Profit margins are consistently high (68-69%), indicating strong profitability.
* **Equity:** Equity fluctuates, showing no strong trend upward or downward.
* **ROE:**  Return on equity exhibits variability and includes an extremely high value (36.54%) in one quarter which may require further investigation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last two days) or analyst opinions were provided.  The lack of this context hinders a complete assessment. Information regarding market outlook is also missing.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the given period. While profit margins are high, revenue growth is stagnant.  EPS shows considerable volatility, and the unusually high EPS value in one quarter needs to be explained.  Technical indicators suggest potential short-term recovery, but the long-term outlook remains uncertain due to consistent negative alpha and a reported (potentially erroneous) extremely negative expected return. The lack of recent news and market outlook information prevents a conclusive assessment.  Further investigation is needed to resolve inconsistencies and gain additional context before making informed investment decisions. The -1121.3% expected return is highly suspect and requires clarification.

**8. Recommendations:**

Given the data, JNJ presents a high-risk investment.  The substantial underperformance relative to the market, coupled with the volatile EPS and unclear revenue growth, makes a long-term investment questionable.  Further investigation into the exceptionally high EPS figure of $10.32, access to recent news and analyst opinions, and clarification on the reported expected return are crucial before any investment decision. A comprehensive financial statement analysis and comparison with similar companies is recommended before making any investment decision.
