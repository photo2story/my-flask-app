| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 28.0% | 56.0% | -1.0% | 0.0 | 275.3 |

| 2017-2019  | 20.0% | 10.8% | -9.0% | 0.7 | 303.6 |
| 2018-2020  | 14.0% | 59.8% | -12.0% | 0.5 | 336.4 |
| 2019-2021  | 28.0% | 59.9% | -26.0% | 0.3 | 374.9 |
| 2020-2022  | 4.0% | 61.2% | -2.0% | 0.3 | 397.3 |

Consistent negative Alpha values across multiple years indicate underperformance relative to the market benchmark.  The fluctuating Beta suggests volatility comparable to, or slightly less than, the market in some periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $154.36
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $151.15
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $158.03
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $157.46

The price is below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-term trend.  The recent price increase of $1.73 from the previous close indicates a potential short-term reversal, but further observation is needed.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk according to the provided scale)
* **RSI:** 42.21 (Approaching oversold territory, but not definitively so)
* **PPO:** -0.57 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Strength Divergence:** -10.9% (Short-term decline)
* **Expected Return (Long-term):** -47.9% (This represents significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a 2+ year timeframe. It's crucial to clarify the methodology used to derive this estimate).


The relatively low RSI and negative PPO suggest a bearish trend, supported by the negative relative strength divergence. The price increase of $1.73 might signal a minor bounce but doesn't negate the overall bearish sentiment.  The high MRI further reinforces the high-risk assessment. The negative long-term expected return requires further investigation regarding its calculation and assumptions.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |

Revenue remains relatively stable.  The substantial difference in EPS between October 2023 and later quarters needs clarification.  It could be related to one-time events or accounting changes.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, indicated by a negative alpha and a large negative return difference. While the company shows consistently high profit margins and relatively stable revenue, the recent earnings report shows a considerable drop in EPS, which needs further explanation. Short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend, but the long-term outlook requires a more thorough assessment of the factors driving the EPS decline and a reassessment of the -47.9% long-term expected return calculation.  Further investigation into the reasons behind the significant EPS drop in Q4 2023 is crucial for a complete analysis.  The high Market Risk Indicator adds another layer of caution.  More detailed fundamental analysis is needed to provide a comprehensive conclusion.
