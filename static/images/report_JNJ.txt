2025-01-17 - Analysis Report
Here's a report summarizing the analysis of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) based on the provided data.

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a global healthcare company producing medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods, significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the period analyzed.  The cumulative return for JNJ is 26.14%, while the S&P 500's cumulative return is 116.43%.  This represents a substantial lag of -90.3 percentage points.  The relative divergence of -90.3 places JNJ at the 7.5th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  While the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) shows periods of strong growth (e.g., 2015-2017, 2019-2021), the recent years have seen negative growth, contributing to the significant underperformance.  The consistently near-zero alpha indicates that JNJ has not significantly outperformed the market after accounting for its beta (systematic risk).  The beta itself is not provided consistently across all years, but its relatively low value suggests that JNJ's performance is less volatile than the overall market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

JNJ's closing price is $147.79, slightly below the last market price of $147.86.  The stock price is trading below its 5-day ($144.81), 20-day ($144.67), and 60-day ($151.07) moving averages. This suggests a downward trend in the short to medium term.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (55.52):**  Indicates the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting a neutral sentiment.
* **PPO (0.43):** A positive value suggests potential upward momentum, although it's relatively low.
* **Relative Strength:** The recent 20-day relative strength change of +3.2% suggests a short-term upward trend.
* **Expected Return (-341.5%):** This extremely negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 is highly unusual and warrants further investigation. It's likely an error or reflects a highly pessimistic long-term outlook (over 2 years) considering the company's fundamentals.  The provided -341.5% figure requires careful review and validation.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show some fluctuation. While revenue remains relatively stable around $21-22B, EPS shows variability.  The significant jump in EPS in the October 2023 quarter (10.32) compared to the following quarters needs further investigation. It is likely due to a one-time event or accounting adjustment rather than a consistent trend.  A deeper dive into the company's financial statements is necessary to understand these variations.

**5. Financial Information (Revenue & Profitability):**

Revenue has remained relatively consistent in the past year, hovering around $21-22 billion.  Profit margins are consistently high, ranging from 68% to 70%. This indicates strong profitability and efficient operations.

**5. Financial Information (Capital & Profitability):**

Equity fluctuates between $68B and $71B.  ROE (Return on Equity) is volatile, ranging from 3.84% to 36.54%.  The exceptionally high ROE in the September 2023 quarter (36.54%) requires a detailed examination to identify the underlying drivers.  It may be an outlier due to accounting changes or one-time events, which would need further clarification.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in recent years, despite generally strong revenue and profit margins.  The recent price action suggests a short-term downward trend, although the RSI and PPO indicators are relatively neutral.  The extremely negative projected return of -341.5% is highly suspicious and needs clarification. The variability in EPS and the unusually high ROE in one quarter necessitates careful review of JNJ's financial statements to identify any unusual accounting practices or non-recurring items. Further investigation is required before drawing definitive conclusions about future performance.  The significant underperformance suggests a re-evaluation of JNJâ€™s investment appeal relative to the broader market.
