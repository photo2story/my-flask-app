* **20-Day Moving Average:** $151.62

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (18.54):**  Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (-0.32):** Shows a bearish momentum.
* **Relative Strength (20-day):**  A recent increase (1.0) suggests a short-term upward movement, likely a temporary bounce within the overall downtrend.
* **Expected Return (0.0%):**  This suggests that, based on the provided data, no significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is projected for long-term (2+ years) buy-and-hold strategy.  The lack of substantial outperformance in the past combined with current bearish indicators reinforce this. The current price of $146.62 near the oversold RSI might indicate a potential bounce, but it does not necessarily imply a major trend reversal.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The recent earnings data reveals inconsistent trends:

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows some fluctuation, mostly staying around $22B in recent quarters. There is no clear upward or downward trend, though it does show slight revenue growth.
* **EPS:** EPS is highly volatile, ranging from $1.12 to $10.32. This significant variation warrants further investigation into the underlying causes to understand the discrepancy and inform investment decisions.  Without additional context, it's difficult to determine if these fluctuations reflect normal business cycles or extraordinary events.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, hovering around $21-$22 billion. Profit margins are consistently high (68-69%), suggesting strong profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity fluctuates, and ROE shows significant variation, ranging from 3.84% to 36.54%.  The extreme value of 36.54% for 2023-09-30 needs further context to understand its significance.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information not provided in the initial prompt.  To complete this analysis, please provide recent news articles, market outlooks, and analyst opinions.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

Johnson & Johnson is currently experiencing a period of underperformance relative to the S&P 500.  While the company demonstrates consistent profitability, recent earnings show high EPS volatility and a lack of clear revenue growth trends. Technical indicators suggest an oversold condition and bearish momentum, although a short-term upward bounce might be underway.  The lack of information regarding recent news and analyst opinions prevents a more comprehensive assessment. The expected return of 0.0% suggests that investors shouldn't anticipate outperforming the market significantly with a long-term investment.  Further investigation into the causes of the EPS volatility is crucial.  The high profit margins and generally stable revenue might indicate a resilient business, but the underperformance relative to the market and the uncertainty surrounding recent earnings make this stock a potentially risky investment at the moment.


**8.  Recommendation:**

Based on the provided data, further investigation is needed before making any investment decisions. Consider conducting in-depth due diligence, including researching the causes of the EPS volatility and incorporating recent news and analyst opinions before taking any action.  Given the current market position and performance relative to the benchmark index, a conservative approach is recommended until more clarity emerges.
