## Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock Performance Review

**0) Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Johnson & Johnson is a multinational corporation that manufactures medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.  The following analysis examines JNJ's performance against the S&P 500 (VOO) based on provided data.  Note that significant discrepancies exist between the provided data points for earnings and financial information compared to typical JNJ reporting. The analysis below proceeds with the provided data, but the accuracy and reliability of the results must be questioned.


**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **JNJ Cumulative Return:** 31.40%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 120.05%
* **Return Difference:** -88.7%
* **Relative Divergence:** 8.8% (This indicates that JNJ's underperformance relative to VOO is in the 8.8th percentile of historical divergence, implying relatively poor performance historically, considering minimum and maximum values).

JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the measured period.  The alpha values in the provided data are inconsistent and suggest periods of both outperformance and underperformance compared to the market.  Further investigation is needed to reconcile this discrepancy with the large negative return difference.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |
|------------|------|------|-------|------|-------|
| 2015-2017  | 34.0% | 0.2% | 6.0% | -0.1 | 277.3 |
| 2016-2018  | 12.0% | 10.8% | -7.0% | 0.0 | 263.1 |
| 2017-2019  | 21.0% | 10.8% | -9.0% | 0.7 | 305.7 |
| 2018-2020  | 12.0% | 10.8% | -16.0% | 0.4 | 338.8 |
| 2019-2021  | 28.0% | 7.9% | -43.0% | 0.4 | 377.6 |
| 2020-2022  | 17.0% | 7.9% | 9.0% | 0.4 | 400.1 |
| 2021-2023  | -11.0% | 6.9% | 0.4 | 0.4 | 365.8 |
| 2022-2024  | -25.0% | 8.0% | 0.3 | 0.3 | 348.2 |
| 2023-2025  | -7.0% | 8.0% | 0.3 | 0.3 | 371.4 |

The highly variable alpha values suggest inconsistent performance relative to the market benchmark. The negative alpha values are particularly concerning. The Beta values are generally low, suggesting lower volatility than the market, which is inconsistent with the large MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values presented, which indicates substantial declines in value.



**2) Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $154.24
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $153.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $149.81
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $148.97

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term upward trend. However, the difference between the price and the 20-day and 60-day averages is relatively small, indicating that this upward trend might be fragile.  The recent price change of $0.73 (approximately 0.5%) is a modest increase, and does not signal a significant “sudden” upward trend.

**3) Technical Indicators:**

* **RSI:** 63.83 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.36 (Positive, suggesting a bullish trend)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -0.5 (Suggests a recent short-term weakening of the upward trend)
* **Expected Return (vs. S&P 500):** -295.5% (This extremely negative value suggests a significant underperformance projection relative to the S&P 500 over the long term. This result again casts doubt on the overall validity of the provided data)


**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue       |
|------------|--------|---------------|
| 2024-10-23 | 1.12   | $22.47B       |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.95   | $22.45B       |
| 2024-05-01 | 1.35   | $21.38B       |
| 2024-02-16 | 1.68   | $21.39B       |
| 2023-10-27 | 10.32  | $21.35B       |

The EPS figures show significant volatility, with a surprisingly high EPS of $10.32 in Q4 2023. This needs clarification, as it is far higher than other quarters and inconsistent with typical JNJ reporting patterns.  Revenue remains relatively stable.  This data needs further verification before drawing conclusions.


**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $22.47B   | 69.01%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $22.45B   | 69.40%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $21.38B   | 69.55%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $21.39B   | 68.23%       |
| 2023-09-30 | $21.35B   | 69.06%       |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity     | ROE           |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $70.16B   | 3.84%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $71.54B   | 6.55%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $70.02B   | 4.65%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $68.77B   | 5.89%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $71.23B   | 36.54%       |

Profit margins are consistently high and stable, indicating strong profitability. However, the ROE shows substantial variability, with an unusually high value of 36.54% in Q3 2023 that warrants further investigation.  Like other data points, this information requires further verification before drawing reliable conclusions.



**6) Overall Conclusion:**

Based on the *provided* data, JNJ shows significant underperformance against the S&P 500. While some technical indicators suggest a short-term positive outlook, the substantially negative expected return and the conflicting alpha values raise serious concerns.  The significant inconsistencies within the provided financial and earnings data necessitate a thorough review of the data's source and accuracy before any investment decisions are made.  The provided data raises significant questions about its validity and should not be relied upon for investment decisions. Independent verification from reliable financial sources is crucial.
