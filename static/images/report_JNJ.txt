JNJ's performance has lagged behind the S&P 500 considerably,  with a negative expected return.  While the company maintains strong profit margins and relatively stable revenue, the inconsistent earnings data and fluctuating ROE require further investigation.  The relatively high MDD values across several periods reveal significant risks associated with the investment. The provided data suggests caution and a need for a more comprehensive due diligence process before making any investment decisions.  Further analysis of financial statements and competitive landscape is crucial for a more informed assessment.  The unexpectedly high EPS in one quarter demands specific attention and explanation.
