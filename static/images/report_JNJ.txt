## Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Overview:**

Johnson & Johnson is a multinational medical device, pharmaceutical, and consumer packaged goods company.  The cumulative return of JNJ (23.9992%) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) (118.3944%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is -94.4%, placing it at the 3.9th percentile of its historical range compared to the S&P 500.  The alpha consistently registers near zero, indicating that JNJ's performance is largely explained by its beta (market correlation).  The beta itself fluctuates, suggesting varied market sensitivity over the years.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows generally increasing trend, with a minor dip in recent periods.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $145.05
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $145.24
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $147.73
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $154.31

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a bearish short-to-medium-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (36.04):** Indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (0.07):** A slightly positive value, indicating a weak bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-2.4):** Shows a recent short-term downward trend.
* **Expected Return (-676.1%):** This extraordinarily negative value requires further clarification. It likely represents a significant underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over a long-term projection (2+ years) and needs to be investigated for potential errors or underlying assumptions in the calculation.  A negative expected return does not automatically imply a bad investment, particularly with long-term buy-and-hold strategies.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided quarterly earnings data shows volatility in EPS and relatively stable revenue.  There's no clear trend for revenue, only slight variations between $21.35B and $22.47B.  EPS fluctuated considerably, reaching a high of $10.32 in Q4 2023, followed by significant drops in subsequent quarters.  Without knowing the expectations, itâ€™s impossible to determine if any particular quarter represented a beat or miss.  Further analysis, including historical data and analysts' estimates would be needed.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively consistent, fluctuating slightly around $22 Billion. Profit margins are stable and high, ranging from 68.23% to 69.55%, indicating strong profitability.


**Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows some fluctuation but overall remains above $68 Billion. ROE is highly volatile; the outlier of 36.54% in Q3 2023 needs further investigation to understand the cause.  Otherwise, ROE is relatively modest and ranging from 3.84% to 6.55%.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent (within the last two days) earnings news is provided. Information about recent market outlook, analyst opinions, and performance highlights is lacking.  This significantly limits a comprehensive analysis.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ significantly underperformed the S&P 500 over the examined period.  While the recent price action suggests a bearish short-term trend, oversold RSI levels hint at potential short-term upside.  However, the extraordinarily negative projected long-term return needs serious investigation.  The inconsistent EPS figures, volatile ROE, and the absence of crucial information (analyst expectations, recent news) prevent a definitive conclusion. More data is required before making any informed investment decisions. The relatively stable revenue and high profit margins are positive indicators, but these are overshadowed by the negative performance relative to the market and the lack of clarity on future prospects.

**8. Recommendations:**

Further investigation is crucial. Obtain the following:

* Clarification on the methodology and assumptions for the -676.1% expected return.
* Analyst expectations for EPS and revenue for comparison with reported results.
* Recent news and analyst opinions on JNJ's future performance.
* A longer-term historical performance dataset to assess long-term trend.

Only after obtaining this information can a more accurate and reliable assessment of JNJ's investment potential be made.
