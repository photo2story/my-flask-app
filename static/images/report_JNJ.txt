**1. Company Overview and Performance Comparison:**

Johnson & Johnson is a multinational corporation that manufactures medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.  Over the period analyzed, JNJ significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (VOO), with a cumulative return of 37.66% compared to VOO's 82.57%.  The -44.9% difference places JNJ's performance in the lower 32.8% of its historical range relative to the S&P 500.

**Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows inconsistent alpha and beta values over different time periods.  While positive alpha indicates outperformance (above the market benchmark), negative values imply underperformance. The significant variation in alpha values suggests that JNJ's performance relative to the market has been highly volatile and unpredictable.  The beta values hover around 0.1-0.7, suggesting a relatively low to moderate sensitivity to market fluctuations, though this also varies significantly over the periods shown.  The market capitalization (Cap(B)) remains relatively large and stable.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

The current price of JNJ is slightly below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a mild downward trend in the short term. The price is also below the 60-day moving average, further supporting this short-term bearish trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

The RSI value of 41.12 is close to the oversold threshold (typically 30), suggesting potential buying opportunities. However, the PPO value of 0.266, while positive, is relatively low, indicating weak bullish momentum.  The negative recent relative divergence (-8.2) points to a short-term decline. The MRI of 0.4053 suggests a medium-risk level for the market.  The -53.6% projected return is particularly concerning, highlighting a significant expected underperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows some volatility in both EPS and revenue.  There is also a duplicated data point for 2025-04-23.  A more comprehensive analysis would require additional data points to establish trends and draw meaningful conclusions.  Further, the large discrepancy between the first and second entry for 2025-04-23 requires clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of crucial financial data like Total Revenue and Gross Profit prevents a thorough financial health assessment.  This missing information significantly limits the depth of the analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ's recent performance has been underwhelming compared to the S&P 500. While some technical indicators (RSI) suggest potential buying opportunities, the negative expected return (-53.6%), weak PPO, and consistent underperformance highlighted by the alpha/beta analysis raise serious concerns. The absence of key financial data further hinders a complete assessment.  The short-term price action indicates a mild downward trend.  Before investing, further investigation into the reasons for JNJ's underperformance, clarification of the duplicated earnings data, and access to complete financial statements are crucial.
