**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a volatile picture.  EPS figures fluctuate considerably between quarters, with no clear upward or downward trend easily discernible. Revenue remains relatively stable, hovering around the $21-22 billion range.  There is no information provided to assess whether these figures were "beats" or "misses" against market expectations, making a full evaluation impossible.

* **ROE:**  Highly variable, ranging from a very low 3.84% to an extremely high 36.54% (likely an outlier). This volatility necessitates further investigation to understand the contributing factors.  The lack of consistency raises concerns about the reliability or completeness of the data.

Further investigation is crucial before making any investment decision. The provided data is insufficient to confidently recommend either buying or selling JNJ stock.  Detailed financial statements and analysis from reputable sources are required for a thorough evaluation.  The unusual data points warrant further due diligence to ascertain their validity.
