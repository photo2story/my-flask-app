    *   Concerning negative expected return compared to the S&P 500.
    *   High RSI suggests overbought conditions and a potential pullback.

**Conclusion:**

While JNJ exhibits financial strength and analyst support, the underperformance compared to the S&P 500 and the concerning negative expected return are major red flags. The overbought RSI and recent decline in relative divergence suggest caution in the short term. The high MDD combined with significant negative Alpha of the recent past requires extra diligence as to the holding of this stock. A potential investor should carefully consider these factors before making an investment decision, thoroughly researching the reasons behind the negative expected return and whether the recent surge is sustainable given the valuation concerns and recent divergence trends. It might be wise to wait for a correction or more clarity on the company's future prospects before investing.
