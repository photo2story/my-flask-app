**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided data, JNJ presents a mixed investment picture. While the company is fundamentally strong (as evidenced by its size and profitability), its recent performance relative to the S&P 500 has been poor.  The recent jump in EPS and ROE is encouraging, but further investigation is needed to determine if this is a sustainable trend. Investors should closely monitor news, earnings releases, and company announcements to assess the risks and opportunities associated with JNJ. The extremely negative expected return warrants serious consideration and further research.
