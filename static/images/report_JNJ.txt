*   **Beta:** Measures the volatility of the investment relative to the market. A Beta of less than 1 suggests lower volatility than the market. JNJ consistently has a Beta below 1, suggesting it is less volatile than the overall market, and it's Beta has been steadily decreasing.

**Analysis:** JNJ has significantly underperformed the S&P 500, especially in recent years. Its lower Beta indicates lower volatility, which aligns with its reputation as a stable, large-cap company. However, the negative Alpha suggests it's not delivering excess returns compared to the market, even when considering its lower risk profile. The steadily declining Beta could mean the stock is increasingly less responsive to overall market movements.

**2) Recent Stock Price Fluctuations**

*   **Last-Market:** Price: $207.35, Previous Close: $206.95, Change: $0.19

*   **20-day SMA:** $206.994
*   **60-day SMA:** $198.7602

**Analysis:** The stock price is currently trading above its 5-day, 20-day, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term bullish trend. The fact that the 5-day SMA is slightly above the 20-day SMA reinforces this. The price is trending upwards.

**3) RSI, PPO, and Expected Return Analysis**

*   **MRI (Market Risk Indicator):** 0.8 (Medium Investment Recommended)
*   **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 43.29. This suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold.

*   **Hybrid Signal:** cash_0%_Buy 80% of cash (2 shares - Caution - MRI:0.70) (Cash Ratio: 0% on 2025-12-15) - This indicates the signal is recommending to purchase the stock.
*   **Recent (20 days) relative divergence change:** 3.4 (+): 단기상승 (Short-term rise)
*   **Expected Return (%):** -53.0 - Significantly negative expected return.

**Analysis:** The MRI suggests a medium investment recommendation, providing a contradictory signal when compared to expected return, RSI and PPO. The RSI is neutral, but the negative PPO and the significantly negative Expected Return suggest caution. While the recent divergence change indicates a short-term upward movement, the long-term outlook appears bearish based on the expected return.

**4) Recent News & Significant Events**

*   **Positive Headlines:**
    *   "More Upside For JNJ Stock In 2026?" (Forbes)
    *   "Johnson & Johnson declares $1.30 per share dividend for Q1 2026" (Investing.com)

**Analysis:** The news is a mixed bag. While there's positive sentiment around dividend payouts, institutional investment, and potential future upside, the stock's reaction to the Halda deal and analyst target revision warrants caution. The 45.8% surge in 2025 is being questioned, and investors should analyze if that surge is based on strong financial fundamentals or potentially speculative hype.

**Analysis:** Revenue has been increasing recently, and the profit margin is consistently high, indicating strong profitability. Equity has also been growing, which is a positive sign. ROE (Return on Equity) saw a significant spike in Q1 2025, and has returned to a normal range. This should be examined to see if it's sustainable.

**7) Comprehensive Analysis (Summary)**

Johnson & Johnson presents a mixed picture.

*   **Underperformance:** It has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 in cumulative returns and exhibits negative Alpha in recent periods. Its lower Beta signals less volatility than the overall market.
*   **Short-Term Bullish Trend:** Recent price action suggests a short-term bullish trend.
*   **Long-Term Concerns:** The negative Expected Return is a major red flag. This, combined with the neutral RSI and the negative PPO, suggests caution about the long-term outlook.
*   **Mixed News:** While some news articles suggest potential upside, others highlight concerns and question the sustainability of recent gains.
*   **Analyst Optimism:** Analysts generally maintain a "Buy" consensus and a slightly higher target price, but this should be viewed in light of the other concerning indicators.
*   **Volatile Earnings:** EPS and Revenue have been fluctuating.
*   **Strong Financials:** JNJ has maintained strong revenue, profit margin, equity and ROE (although a significant Q1 2025 should be investigated).

**Conclusion:** While JNJ might appeal to risk-averse investors seeking stability and dividend income, the underperformance relative to the market, the negative expected return, and the mixed news warrant careful consideration. Further due diligence is needed to understand the reasons behind the negative outlook and to assess whether the analyst optimism is justified.
