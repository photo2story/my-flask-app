## Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Stock Review

**0. Overview:**

Johnson & Johnson is a multinational corporation that manufactures and sells medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and consumer packaged goods.

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

JNJ's cumulative return is 39.95%, while the S&P 500's (VOO) is 76.31%.  Therefore, JNJ underperformed VOO by 36.36 percentage points at the end of the period.  The relative divergence, considering historical maximum and minimum divergences, is at the 41.4th percentile, indicating that the current underperformance is relatively moderate compared to its historical range.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided data shows fluctuating alpha and beta values over the years.  While alpha (which represents excess return compared to the market) shows some positive periods, indicating periods of outperformance, it’s also seen negative alphas, indicating periods of underperformance. The beta (which measures systematic risk relative to the market) generally hovers around 0.0 to 0.7, suggesting that JNJ's price movements have been somewhat less volatile than the overall market (beta <1).  Market capitalization remained relatively stable. Note that a detailed interpretation would require understanding the specific methodology and risk-free rate used in the alpha calculation.

The provided EPS and revenue data shows some fluctuation.  A more detailed analysis would require a comparison to prior years' earnings and an understanding of the company's guidance.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

JNJ shows a history of consistent revenue and high profit margins. However, its recent performance has lagged behind the S&P 500. While some positive indicators (RSI, PPO) suggest potential upside, the negative projected long-term return relative to the S&P 500 and the fluctuating alpha and beta values raise concerns.  The significant spike in EPS in Q4 2023 needs further investigation to understand its impact on future performance.  A thorough assessment requires deeper due diligence, including examination of the company's future growth prospects, competitive landscape, and potential risks.  The provided -37.2% long-term expected return needs careful scrutiny of the methodology used to arrive at this figure before drawing strong conclusions.
