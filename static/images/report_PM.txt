The alpha and beta values fluctuate significantly year-over-year.  High positive alpha values in some years suggest outperformance, while negative alpha values indicate underperformance relative to the benchmark.  The beta fluctuates, indicating varying sensitivity to market movements.  A more thorough analysis, considering the market conditions during each period, is necessary to draw robust conclusions.  The high CAGR values in some years suggest periods of strong growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $155.01
* **Last Market Price:** $157.69
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $152.92
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $152.21
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $139.33

The price is currently above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The recent price increase of $1.63 indicates a positive short-term trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4283 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 66.91 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** -0.2984 (Suggests a bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +0.2 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -5.6% (Expected to underperform S&P 500 in the long term)


The RSI is close to overbought levels, suggesting a potential price correction. The negative PPO and low expected return relative to the S&P 500 are bearish signals.  The recent price increase, however, contrasts with these indicators. This discrepancy warrants further investigation. The recent price increase of $1.63 is a relatively small jump, and not drastic enough to qualify as a "sudden surge."


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 1.98  | $9.91B        |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.54  | $9.47B        |
| 2024-04-26 | 1.38  | $8.79B        |
| 2023-10-26 | 1.32  | $9.14B        |
| 2024-10-24 | 1.32  | $9.14B        |

There appears to be a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24.  Assuming this is an error, the data shows a general upward trend in both EPS and revenue, with a notable increase in EPS in the October 2024 quarter.  Further analysis would require more historical data for comparison and to assess the sustainability of this trend.

| 2024-06-30 | $9.47B | 64.67% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.79B | 63.66% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| 2024-09-30 | $-9.69B | -31.79% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-9.74B | -24.69% |
| 2024-03-31 | $-10.31B | -20.84% |

Negative equity is a concerning indicator, warranting further investigation into the company's capital structure and debt levels. The ROE is also volatile and frequently negative, further highlighting the need for a more in-depth analysis of the company's financial health.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PM has shown significant outperformance against the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  However,  the high relative divergence raises concerns about the sustainability of this outperformance. The recent price movement indicates a short-term upward trend, supported by improving earnings. Nevertheless, negative ROE, negative expected return relative to the S&P 500, and negative PPO signal potential bearish sentiment.  The negative equity figure is a major red flag requiring further investigation.  A comprehensive analysis considering all these factors – including a detailed examination of the company's debt levels and financial health – is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The seemingly contradictory signals from various indicators suggest a high level of risk and the need for caution.
