**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter     | Equity     | ROE           |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31  | $-11.75B   | 4.93%         |
| 2024-09-30  | $-9.69B    | -31.79%       |
| 2024-06-30  | $-9.74B    | -24.69%       |

| 2023-12-31  | $-11.22B   | -19.56%       |

Negative equity is a concern and requires further investigation into the company's balance sheet and accounting practices.  The ROE is highly volatile and frequently negative. This warrants closer scrutiny.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PM has shown significant historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by a large cumulative return difference.  Recent price action suggests a potential uptrend, supported by positive technical indicators.  However,  the negative equity and highly volatile, often negative, ROE are significant red flags.  While recent earnings have shown improvement, the sustainability of this trend needs further assessment.  The negative short-term expected return (-1.5%) suggests caution in the immediate term.  A long-term investment decision should carefully consider the risk associated with the negative equity and the inherent volatility of the tobacco industry.  Further due diligence, including a comprehensive financial statement analysis and thorough understanding of the company's long-term strategic plans, is necessary before making any investment decision.
