## Philip Morris International Inc (PM) Stock Review

**0. Summary Statistics:**

* **Ticker:** PM
* **Company:** Philip Morris International Inc.  (A leading international tobacco company)
* **Cumulative Return (PM):** 79.42%
* **Cumulative Return (VOO):** 71.02%
* **Return Difference (PM - VOO):** 8.4%
* **Relative Divergence:** 87.4% (This indicates PM's performance relative to VOO is in the top 87.4% percentile based on historical data.)


**1. Performance Comparison and Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

PM significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period, with a cumulative return 8.4 percentage points higher.  The relative divergence suggests this outperformance is relatively strong compared to historical fluctuations. However, the alpha and beta values show inconsistent outperformance, ranging from significantly negative alpha to a positive alpha of 1.5.  The beta is generally around 1, indicating PM's price movements are relatively correlated with the overall market.  The high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) in several periods, particularly 2016-2018, highlights the substantial risk associated with PM. Capitalization (Cap(B)) shows consistent growth throughout the period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $150.62
* **Previous Close:** $162.07
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $157.14
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $153.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $143.01

The stock price experienced a recent drop of $7.06 (4.35%), falling below both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages but above the 60-day moving average. This suggests a short-term bearish trend, although longer-term trends might be more positive given the 60-day average.  The significant recent drop warrants further investigation into potential underlying causes.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4693 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 43.97 (Slightly below neutral; potentially oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.1937 (Negative; suggesting bearish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** 8.8% (Positive; indicating short-term upward momentum)
* **Expected Return:** -11.8% (This reflects recent price movements, not long-term potential)
* **Long-term Expected Return (vs S&P 500):**  Further analysis and forecasting models are necessary to estimate long-term excess returns against the S&P 500 beyond the given information.  The historical data show periods of outperformance and underperformance, making a precise prediction challenging without additional forecasting techniques.

The high MRI indicates increased market risk, while the negative PPO reinforces the short-term bearish sentiment. The RSI is approaching oversold territory, which could suggest a potential bounce.  The large recent price change (-7.06) strongly indicates a significant downward price correction.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 1.98  | $9.91B       |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.54  | $9.47B       |
| 2024-04-26 | 1.38  | $8.79B       |
| 2023-10-26 | 1.32  | $9.14B       |
| 2024-10-24 | 1.32  | $9.14B       | *(Duplicate entry - likely a data error)*

Earnings show a generally upward trend, though there's inconsistency quarter-to-quarter. The October 2024 EPS is notably higher than previous quarters, potentially contributing to the prior price valuation.  The data needs clarification on the duplicate entry.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is relatively stable, with consistent high profit margins, suggesting strong operational efficiency.

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|

| 2024-09-30 | $9.91B | 66.04% |

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE       |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-11.75B | 4.93%     |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PM has shown a history of outperforming the S&P 500, but with significant periods of volatility and substantial risk as evidenced by the high MDD values and the negative equity. Recent performance has declined, reflecting the negative expected return and negative PPO. While earnings have been generally positive and profit margins are high, the negative equity and volatile ROE present significant financial concerns.  The recent price drop needs further investigation to understand its cause.  A long-term investment strategy requires careful consideration of these risks, alongside potentially strong long-term growth prospects based on the historical outperformance and consistent revenue. Further due diligence, including examining the underlying causes for the recent price drop and the negative equity, is recommended before making any investment decisions.
