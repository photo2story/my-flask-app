**6. Overall Analysis:**

PM has shown strong cumulative returns exceeding the S&P 500, although the recent short-term trend is bearish.  High profit margins are positive, but negative equity and volatile ROE are major concerns.  The high MRI indicates a significant risk level.  A long-term investment carries significant risk given the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 and the concerning financial indicators.  Further investigation into the negative equity and volatile ROE is crucial before making any investment decision.  Clarification on the duplicate earnings data is also needed.
