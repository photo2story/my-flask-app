## Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) Stock Review

**0) Executive Summary:**

Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) is a leading international tobacco company.  This report analyzes PM's recent performance, comparing it to the S&P 500 (VOO), examining key financial metrics, and providing an outlook for potential future returns.

**1) Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Philip Morris International (PM) shows a significantly higher cumulative return than the S&P 500 (VOO).

* **PM Cumulative Return:** 135.79%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 87.98%
* **Return Difference:** 47.81%
* **Relative Divergence:** 88.1% (This indicates PM's outperformance is in the top 88.1% percentile relative to its historical performance against the S&P 500.)

The provided Alpha and Beta data shows mixed results across different time periods,  indicating varying degrees of outperformance (positive alpha) and market sensitivity (beta).  While some periods show substantial outperformance, others show underperformance relative to the market.  The significant change in capitalization (Cap(B)) over the years also reflects the company's growth and market position.  Further investigation into the drivers of these fluctuations is recommended.

**2) Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $172.0
* **Last Market Price:** $169.7 (a decrease of $2.30 from the previous close)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $173.10
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $166.37
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $157.11

The stock price is currently below its 5-day moving average, suggesting short-term bearish momentum, but above its 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting longer-term bullish momentum.  The recent drop of $1.34 reflects a negative short-term trend.

**3) Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.37 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 69.68 (Approaching overbought territory)
* **PPO:** 0.11 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +0.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return:** -1.7% (short-term)

The combination of a relatively high RSI and a positive PPO suggests a potential for short-term correction despite the positive relative divergence.  The -1.7% expected return further supports this potential correction. The negative short-term outlook needs to be considered alongside the positive long-term outlook in light of the long-term outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  The long-term expected return (2+ years) needs additional detail and modeling to provide a meaningful prediction and should be seen as contingent on various factors not reflected in the data.

**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|--------------|
| 2025-04-24 | $1.72 | $9.30B       |
| 2024-10-24 | $1.98 | $9.91B       |
| 2024-07-25 | $1.54 | $9.47B       |
| 2024-04-26 | $1.38 | $8.79B       |
| 2025-04-24 | $1.38 | $8.79B       |

There appears to be an error in the data; the 2025-04-24 data is duplicated.  Assuming this is an error, the data shows some fluctuation in both EPS and revenue.  A more in-depth analysis, including YoY and QoQ growth rates, is necessary to draw robust conclusions about the earnings trend.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $9.30B | 67.32%       |
| 2024-12-31 | $9.71B | 64.73%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.91B | 66.04%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.47B | 64.67%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.79B | 63.66%       |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE          |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| 2025-03-31 | $-10.90B | -24.68%      |
| 2024-12-31 | $-11.75B | 4.93%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $-9.69B  | -31.79%      |
| 2024-06-30 | $-9.74B  | -24.69%      |
| 2024-03-31 | $-10.31B | -20.84%      |

The negative equity values raise significant concern and require further investigation.  The highly variable ROE also suggests underlying instability.  This needs careful examination to understand the reasons behind these figures.  Profit margins remain relatively stable and high.

**6) Overall Analysis:**

PM has shown a strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction.  The company's financial statements reveal concerns regarding negative equity and fluctuating ROE, warranting further due diligence.  While long-term prospects may remain positive given the historical outperformance, the short-term outlook appears more cautious due to the negative price momentum and questionable financial metrics. More detailed analysis is needed to provide a comprehensive investment recommendation.  Specifically, understanding the reasons for the negative equity and highly volatile ROE is critical before making any investment decision.
