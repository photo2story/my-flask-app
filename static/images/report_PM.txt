* **Company Overview:** A leading international tobacco company producing and selling cigarettes and other nicotine products.

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

PM's cumulative return (79.57%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (66.69%) by 12.88 percentage points.  The relative divergence (84.9%) indicates PM's performance is situated in the upper 84.9% percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided min and max divergence values.  While this suggests strong relative performance, it's crucial to consider the risk factors (MDD and Beta) discussed below.

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:**

The provided CAGR, MDD, Alpha, and Beta data show highly variable performance over different time periods.  While some periods demonstrate significant alpha (outperformance), others show negative alphas and high maximum drawdowns (MDD).  The beta is also inconsistent, indicating varying levels of market sensitivity.  This underscores the volatility inherent in PM's stock.

* **Closing Price:** $157.59
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $152.74
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $153.91
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $146.48

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term uptrend. However, the relatively small difference between the price and the 20-day MA indicates a possible consolidation or minor correction may be upcoming.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4585 (High Risk category bordering on Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 56.96 (slightly above neutral; not overbought)

* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -12.3% (indicates a recent short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -8.0% (Negative expected excess return relative to S&P 500)  This suggests that, despite recent outperformance, long-term projections indicate potential underperformance against the S&P 500.  Further investigation into the factors contributing to this prediction is warranted.

The recent price change ({'price': 157.59, 'previousClose': 153.89, 'change': 2.4}) shows a modest increase, not indicative of a significant jump or drop.

**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PM has demonstrated strong recent outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  However, this is coupled with substantial volatility and a high-risk profile as evidenced by inconsistent alpha and beta,  high MDD,  and significant negative equity. While the company shows consistent revenue and high profit margins, the negative equity and fluctuating ROE raise serious concerns about financial health and long-term sustainability. The projected negative excess return relative to the S&P 500 over the long term further dampens enthusiasm.  Investors should carefully consider the risk tolerance and thoroughly research the underlying factors contributing to the negative equity and inconsistent performance before investing.  Further analysis, including a deeper dive into debt levels and the company's long-term strategic direction, is recommended before making any investment decisions.  The duplicate data point requires clarification.
