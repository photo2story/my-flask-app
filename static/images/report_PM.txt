**5. Financial Information:**

The lack of total revenue and gross profit data significantly limits a comprehensive financial analysis.  More data is needed to assess profitability and financial health.


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

PM has demonstrated strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  Recent price movements and technical indicators suggest a positive short-term trend. However, the long-term expected return is slightly lower than the S&P 500.  The limited financial data prevents a complete assessment of the company's fundamental strength.  Further research into financial statements and a more complete earnings history is recommended before making any investment decisions. The inconsistent Alpha values highlight the importance of considering various timeframes and market conditions.  The substantial increase in market cap suggests growth but needs further examination in conjunction with other financial metrics.
