## Philip Morris International Inc (PM) Stock Analysis

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Philip Morris International Inc. is a leading international tobacco company.  The company's cumulative return significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO).  Further analysis will delve into the specifics.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **PM Cumulative Return:** 79.20%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 62.39%
* **Return Difference:** 16.8%  (PM outperforms VOO by 16.8 percentage points).
* **Relative Divergence:** 89.5% (This indicates that PM's outperformance relative to VOO is in the top 90th percentile of historical divergence between the two).


The provided alpha and beta analysis shows fluctuating performance against the market (Beta) and varying levels of outperformance (Alpha).  Note that high MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values suggest significant risk.  While recent years show positive alpha, meaning outperformance, the significant swings highlight volatility. The substantial market capitalization (Cap(B)) demonstrates PM's scale in the market.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $152.58
* **Last Market Price:** $152.34
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $153.15
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $153.52
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $144.67

The price is slightly below all moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward pressure.  The recent price increase (0.36) from the previous close is relatively small and does not suggest a significant upward or downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4271 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 50.16 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.60 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -7.1% (This suggests a potential underperformance against S&P 500 in the long-term)

The relatively low MRI suggests moderate risk. The RSI is close to neutral, while the negative PPO indicates bearish momentum.  However, the positive short-term relative divergence suggests a recent upward trend. The negative expected return contrasts with the historical outperformance, warranting further investigation.

Negative equity is concerning and requires further investigation. The ROE is volatile, showing significant swings between positive and negative values.  This likely reflects accounting practices or other factors affecting the reported equity figure and needs further analysis.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PM has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500. However, current indicators suggest a more mixed outlook.  While recent earnings are positive and profit margins are high, the negative expected return, negative PPO, volatile ROE, and significantly negative equity values raise concerns.  The large swings in alpha and beta, combined with high MDD values, highlight volatility inherent in the stock.  Further investigation into the negative equity and the reasons behind the volatile ROE are crucial before making any investment decisions.  A thorough review of the company's financial statements and industry analysis is necessary to gain a more complete understanding of its current position and future prospects.  The duplicate entry in the earnings data also requires clarification.
