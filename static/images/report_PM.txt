Negative equity values are concerning, and the ROE (Return on Equity) fluctuates wildly, with significant negative values in recent quarters. This warrants further investigation into the company's financial health and capital structure.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PM shows strong revenue and consistently high profit margins. However, the negative equity and volatile ROE raise serious concerns about the company's financial stability.  While past performance has outperformed the S&P 500, the current indicators (high MRI, negative PPO, recent price drop) suggest a cautious approach in the short term.  Long-term investment potential requires a deeper dive into the reasons behind the negative equity and the volatility in ROE, and a more comprehensive analysis of long-term growth prospects considering the company's business model and market dynamics.  The provided data is insufficient to definitively support a long-term buy recommendation.  Further due diligence is required.
