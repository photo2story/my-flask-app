* **60-Day Moving Average:** $141.22

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue      |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 1.98  | $9.91 B       |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.54  | $9.47 B       |
| 2024-04-26 | 1.38  | $8.79 B       |
| 2023-10-26 | 1.32  | $9.14 B       |
| 2024-10-24 | 1.32  | $9.14 B       |

There seems to be a duplicate entry for 2024-10-24.  Earnings have shown growth in recent quarters, particularly a significant jump in EPS and revenue in Q4 2024. This is positive; however a more consistent data set is required for robust analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.71B | 64.73% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.91B | 66.04% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.47B | 64.67% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.79B | 63.66% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.05B | 61.73% |

Revenue shows relatively strong and consistent performance over the last year, with healthy profit margins.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $-11.75B | 4.93% |
| 2024-09-30 | $-9.69B | -31.79% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-9.74B | -24.69% |
| 2024-03-31 | $-10.31B | -20.84% |
| 2023-12-31 | $-11.22B | -19.56% |

Negative equity values raise concerns and require further investigation into the company's financial structure.  The fluctuating and largely negative ROE is also a significant cause for concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PM has demonstrated strong performance relative to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, with a significant cumulative return difference.  However, the data also reveals inconsistencies in alpha and beta, suggesting varying levels of risk-adjusted return and market sensitivity over time.  Recent earnings show growth but need to be examined in more detail with accurate data and the highly negative ROE and negative equity values present substantial risks and require further scrutiny before any investment decision is made.  The technical indicators suggest a short-term upward trend, but the RSI is approaching overbought territory, suggesting a potential pullback.  Further detailed analysis of the negative equity and ROE is critical before any investment recommendations can be given.  The provided data is insufficient for a complete and confident long-term investment recommendation.
