**4) Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue      |
|------------|------|--------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 1.98 | $9.91 B      |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.54 | $9.47 B      |

| 2023-10-26 | 1.32 | $9.14 B      |
| 2024-10-24 | 1.32 | $9.14 B      | *(Duplicate entry, likely a data error)*


Earnings show a strong upward trend in EPS and revenue, with the most recent quarter (October 2024) being particularly strong. The duplicate entry needs clarification.

**5) Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.71B | 64.73% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.91B | 66.04% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.47B | 64.67% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.79B | 63.66% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.05B | 61.73% |

Revenue is relatively stable, with high and consistent profit margins.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE |
|---------|---------|-----|
| 2024-12-31 | $-11.75B | 4.93% |
| 2024-09-30 | $-9.69B | -31.79% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-9.74B | -24.69% |
| 2024-03-31 | $-10.31B | -20.84% |
| 2023-12-31 | $-11.22B | -19.56% |


Negative equity is concerning and requires further investigation.  The volatile ROE (Return on Equity) indicates significant fluctuations in profitability relative to shareholder equity.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

PM has shown strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500, as indicated by a high cumulative return difference and relative divergence. Recent price action suggests upward momentum, supported by technical indicators like RSI and PPO.  However,  the negative equity and fluctuating ROE from the financial statements raise concerns.  The provided long-term expected return of -1.5% relative to the S&P 500 needs further investigation as it conflicts with the strong historical outperformance.  A deeper dive into the reasons behind negative equity and the volatility of ROE is crucial before making any investment decisions. The data inconsistencies (duplicate earnings entry) need resolution.  Furthermore, a more comprehensive risk assessment and consideration of external factors (e.g., regulatory changes impacting the tobacco industry) are necessary for a complete evaluation.
