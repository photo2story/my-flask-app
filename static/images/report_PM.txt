| 2024-10-24 | 1.32 | $9.14B       | *(Duplicate entry, potential data error)*


Earnings show some variability, but generally increasing revenue and EPS.  There is a possible data entry error (duplicate entry).  Further investigation is needed for a more precise analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**


**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.71B | 64.73% |

| 2024-06-30 | $9.47B | 64.67% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.79B | 63.66% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.05B | 61.73% |

Revenue is relatively stable, with a slight downward trend in Q1 2024.  Profit margins are consistently high and generally increasing.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity | ROE     |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-11.75B | 4.93%  |
| 2024-09-30 | $-9.69B  | -31.79% |
| 2024-06-30 | $-9.74B  | -24.69% |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PM has shown strong historical outperformance relative to the S&P 500, with a significantly higher cumulative return.  However, the provided alpha and beta analysis highlights variability in its performance against the market. Recent price action shows a positive short-term trend.  While revenue and profit margins are generally healthy, negative equity and volatile ROE raise significant concerns regarding the company's financial health.  The negative expected return (relative to the S&P 500) needs to be carefully considered in the context of the financial information and the overall risk profile, as it is a relatively small number and may be a result of a number of interacting factors.  Further investigation into the data inconsistencies and negative equity is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The data suggest a need for a more thorough fundamental and financial analysis to assess PM's long-term prospects accurately.
