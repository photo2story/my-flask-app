## Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:** Philip Morris International Inc. (PM), a leading international tobacco company, shows strong cumulative returns significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO).  However, recent financial data reveals some inconsistencies that warrant closer examination.  While revenue and profit margins remain healthy, negative equity and ROE figures raise concerns.  Further investigation into these discrepancies is recommended before making investment decisions.


**1. Performance Comparison:**

Philip Morris International (PM) is a leading international tobacco company, manufacturing and selling cigarettes and other nicotine products globally.

* **PM Cumulative Return:** 122.67%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 76.08%

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows varying performance across different time periods. While some periods show positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market), others show negative alpha.  The beta values suggest varying levels of market sensitivity. The high CAGR in some periods may indicate periods of high growth.  However, substantial MDD (Maximum Drawdown) values highlight considerable risk during these periods, particularly between 2016-2018. Further analysis is needed to assess the consistency and sustainability of PM's outperformance.  A significant negative equity in recent quarters requires investigation.

* **Closing Price:** $160.48
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $156.64
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $154.67
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $147.77

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting a potential upward trend.  The recent small positive change of $0.24 does not indicate a significant upward or downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.41 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 57.06 (Neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.17 (Positive, suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +3.5 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (Long-term, >2 years):** -1.7% (This suggests PM may underperform VOO over the long term.  This should be viewed cautiously given the volatility and historical outperformance shown.)

The indicators suggest a relatively neutral to slightly positive outlook.  However, the negative expected return relative to the S&P 500 warrants caution.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

Revenue shows a relatively stable trend, while EPS fluctuates.  The duplicate entry for October 24, 2024, needs clarification.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |

| 2024-03-31 | $8.79B | 63.66% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.05B | 61.73% |

Profit margins are consistently high, indicating strong profitability.  Revenue shows some fluctuations but generally remains stable.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE         |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-11.75B  | 4.93%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $-9.69B   | -31.79%     |
| 2024-06-30 | $-9.74B   | -24.69%     |

| 2023-12-31 | $-11.22B  | -19.56%     |

Negative equity across all reported quarters is a significant red flag, indicating a potential serious financial issue that needs to be investigated further. The fluctuating and largely negative ROE values further reinforce this concern.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PM has historically outperformed the S&P 500, but recent data presents a mixed picture.  While revenue and profit margins remain strong, the negative equity and ROE figures raise serious concerns about the company's financial health.  The high historical MDD also highlights the significant risk associated with PM.  Further investigation is crucial to understand the reasons behind the negative equity and to assess the sustainability of future performance.  The negative long-term expected return compared to VOO warrants a cautious approach.  Before making any investment decisions, a thorough examination of the company's financial statements and future prospects is essential.  This review highlights inconsistencies that need further clarification from reliable financial sources before drawing definite conclusions.
