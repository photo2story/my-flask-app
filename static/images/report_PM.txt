**7. Recommendations:**

Given the company's current performance and future outlook, investors should carefully consider the potential risks and rewards associated with PM before making any investment decisions. While the company's efforts to expand into alternative products offer some potential for growth, the long-term challenges facing the tobacco industry should be factored in. Investors with a longer-term horizon and a tolerance for risk may consider PM as a potential investment, particularly given its strong dividend and brand portfolio. However, investors looking for a more consistent and potentially higher-growth investment may want to consider other options.
