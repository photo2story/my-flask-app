## Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) Stock Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

Philip Morris International Inc. is a leading international tobacco company.  The provided data shows a cumulative return significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  Further analysis is needed to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

* **PM Cumulative Return:** 79.08%
* **VOO Cumulative Return:** 65.78%
* **Return Difference:** 13.3%
* **Relative Divergence:** 85.4% (This indicates PM's performance is in the upper 85.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500).

The Alpha and Beta analysis across different periods shows varying performance relative to the market (S&P 500).  While positive Alpha values indicate outperformance, the highly variable Beta suggests significant market sensitivity.  The large market capitalization (Cap(B)) consistently demonstrates PM's size and influence within the market.

| 2016-2018  | -19.0% | 59.7% | -36.0% | 0.0 | 74.2 |
| 2017-2019  | 5.0% | 59.7% | -24.0% | 0.1 | 100.1 |
| 2018-2020  | 1.0% | 63.7% | -25.0% | 1.1 | 103.8 |

| 2020-2022  | 28.0% | 63.7% | 22.0% | 1.7 | 140.8 |
| 2021-2023  | 13.0% | 70.4% | -4.0% | 0.6 | 138.2 |
| 2022-2024  | 4.0% | 70.4% | -12.0% | 0.5 | 185.7 |

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $151.17
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $150.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $153.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $145.22

The price is currently below both the 20-day and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term bearish trend.  The 5-day moving average being close to the closing price suggests recent price stability. A recent slight price drop (-0.42) is observed.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4292 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 49.53 (Near neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** -0.64 (Negative, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -14.6% (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** -7.9% (This implies a potential underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the long term, despite past outperformance.)  The recent small price drop (-0.42) does not indicate a significant event (no sharp jump or drop).


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue     |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 1.98  | $9.91B      |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.54  | $9.47B      |
| 2024-04-26 | 1.38  | $8.79B      |
| 2023-10-26 | 1.32  | $9.14B      |
| 2024-10-24 | 1.32  | $9.14B      | *(Duplicate entry - potential data error)*

Earnings show a fluctuating trend.  A noticeable spike in EPS in October 2024 needs further investigation. Revenue shows some variability, but generally remains relatively stable around $9B.  The duplicate entry needs clarification.

**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.71B | 64.73% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.91B | 66.04% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.47B | 64.67% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.79B | 63.66% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.05B | 61.73% |

Revenue is relatively stable, with slight fluctuations. Profit margins remain consistently high, above 60%, indicating strong profitability.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE       |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-11.75B | 4.93%     |
| 2024-09-30 | $-9.69B  | -31.79%   |
| 2024-06-30 | $-9.74B  | -24.69%   |
| 2024-03-31 | $-10.31B | -20.84%   |
| 2023-12-31 | $-11.22B | -19.56%   |

Negative equity is a significant concern and requires further investigation.  ROE is highly volatile and shows periods of significant losses. This is a major red flag and needs further examination of the company's balance sheet and debt levels.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

PM has shown strong past performance relative to the S&P 500, but recent indicators suggest a potentially bearish short-term outlook.  The negative expected return over the long term is a key concern, particularly in light of the negative equity and volatile ROE reported in recent financial statements.  The high profit margins are positive, but the negative equity and unstable ROE are major red flags.  Further analysis of the balance sheet, debt levels, and the reasons behind the negative equity are crucial before making any investment decision.  The duplicate data entry in the earnings report needs to be resolved.  Investigating the reasons behind the significant increase in EPS in Q4 2024 is also important.
