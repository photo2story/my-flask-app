PM has historically outperformed the S&P 500, showing a strong cumulative return. However, recent price action indicates a short-term bearish trend, supported by negative PPO and a high MRI.

Before making any investment decision, it is crucial to understand the reasons behind the negative equity and ROE figures, investigate the duplicate earnings data, and clarify the long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500.  The high profit margins are positive, but the negative equity and ROE raise serious questions about the company's financial health.  Further due diligence is strongly recommended.
