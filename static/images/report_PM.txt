**6) Overall Analysis:**

PM has historically outperformed the S&P 500, demonstrating strong revenue and profit margins.  However, the negative equity and ROE raise serious concerns about the company's financial health.  The recent price increase suggests positive short-term momentum, but the negative expected return warrants caution.  A deeper dive into the reasons for the negative equity and ROE, along with a more thorough explanation of the -1.6% expected return, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The inconsistent alpha and beta values highlight the volatility inherent in the stock. Further analysis is recommended to determine the sustainability of the observed outperformance relative to VOO.
