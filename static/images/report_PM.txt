**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows a general upward trend in both EPS and Revenue, though there is some fluctuation. A more detailed analysis would require comparing these numbers to analyst expectations and industry benchmarks. Note that there is a duplicated entry for October 24th, 2024.

| Date       | EPS  | Revenue     |
|------------|------|-------------|
| 2024-10-24 | 1.98 | $9.91 B     |
| 2024-07-25 | 1.54 | $9.47 B     |
| 2024-04-26 | 1.38 | $8.79 B     |
| 2023-10-26 | 1.32 | $9.14 B     |
| 2024-10-24 | 1.32 | $9.14 B     |


**5. Financial Information:**

Revenue is generally stable and shows growth except for the 2024-03-31 quarter.  Profit margins are consistently high, reflecting PM's strong profitability. However, Equity is negative across all periods, and ROE is volatile and largely negative, which is extremely concerning. This requires further investigation into PM's financial health and accounting practices.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $9.71B | 64.73% |
| 2024-09-30 | $9.91B | 66.04% |
| 2024-06-30 | $9.47B | 64.67% |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.79B | 63.66% |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.05B | 61.73% |

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE       |
|---------|-----------|-----------|

| 2024-09-30 | $-9.69B   | -31.79%   |

**6. Overall Analysis:**

PM has shown strong outperformance against the S&P 500 in the past, but the consistency of this performance is questionable based on the provided alpha and beta data.  While recent price action and some earnings figures suggest positive momentum, the negative equity and inconsistent ROE raise serious concerns about the company's long-term financial health. The high RSI suggests the stock may be overbought, and the negative long-term expected return relative to the S&P 500 warrants caution.  A more thorough analysis incorporating industry benchmarks, analyst estimates, and a deeper dive into the company's financial statements is necessary before making any investment decisions.  The extremely high relative divergence compared to VOO warrants a critical examination of the reasons behind this divergence before considering an investment.
