**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity      | ROE          |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $-11.75B   | 4.93%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $-9.69B    | -31.79%      |

| 2023-12-31 | $-11.22B   | -19.56%      |

Negative equity is a significant concern. While ROE shows some improvement in Q4 2024, it remains volatile and largely negative, which is a major red flag and requires further investigation.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

Philip Morris International has shown strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, with high and stable profit margins. However, the negative equity and volatile ROE raise serious concerns about the company's financial health.  The recent earnings show promising EPS growth in Q4 2024, but further investigation into the reasons for this and the persistently negative equity is crucial.  While short-term indicators suggest a positive trend, the long-term investment decision should carefully weigh the significant potential for outperformance against the considerable financial risks indicated by the negative equity and fluctuating ROE.  More detailed financial analysis, including debt levels and cash flow, is necessary before forming a definitive investment opinion.
