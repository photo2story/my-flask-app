**6. Overall Analysis:**

PM has shown substantial outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term, indicated by high cumulative returns and relative divergence.  However, recent financial data, specifically the negative equity and volatile ROE, raise concerns. While short-term technical indicators suggest an upward trend, the long-term expected return is slightly negative relative to the market.  A deeper dive into the reasons for negative equity and fluctuating ROE is crucial.  Further analysis of the earnings data and a complete understanding of the company's financial health are necessary before making any investment decisions. The high profit margins and consistent revenue are positives, but the negative equity is a significant red flag that needs further investigation before a full assessment can be made.
