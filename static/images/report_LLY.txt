2025-04-10 - Analysis Report
## Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) Stock Review

**0. Executive Summary:** Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) is a leading pharmaceutical company.  Its recent performance significantly outperforms the S&P 500, showcasing strong growth and profitability despite some market volatility indicated by recent price action and RSI.  However, high valuations and a potential overbought condition warrant further consideration.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

LLY's cumulative return (272.81%) vastly surpasses the S&P 500's (VOO) return (66.94%) over the analyzed period.  The difference (205.9%) places LLY at the 68.6th percentile of its historical relative performance against the S&P 500, indicating superior performance, but also possibly a high degree of relative outperformance already baked into the price.

The Alpha/Beta analysis shows consistently positive alpha, suggesting outperformance beyond market expectations. The high and increasing Beta indicates higher volatility than the market.  Note the substantial increase in market capitalization (Cap(B)) over the years.

**2. Recent Price Action:**

LLY's closing price is $753.71.  The stock shows a recent price increase of $3.78.  However, it's trading below its 5-day ($746.20), 20-day ($807.40), and 60-day ($829.44) moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.5289 (High Risk).  This suggests caution.
* **RSI:** 31.33 (Oversold).  This indicates potential for a price bounce.
* **PPO:** -1.26 (Bearish).  This aligns with the current price action.
* **Relative Strength Divergence:** Recent 20-day relative strength showed a decrease, suggesting a short-term weakening trend.
* **Expected Return:** 78.2% over the long term (2+ years) relative to the S&P 500. This high expected return needs to be viewed in context with the high risk and current overbought situation.  The significant price increase recently might be a factor leading to this.
