## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products.

LLY's cumulative return is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 484.8 percentage points.  While the relative divergence of 77.3% indicates LLY's performance is high relative to its historical range against the S&P 500, it doesn't imply a guaranteed future outperformance.  The alpha consistently reported as 0.0 in the provided data suggests that the excess returns are not attributable to factors beyond market movements, hinting at a potentially high beta.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 826.71
* **5-Day Moving Average:** 819.06
* **20-Day Moving Average:** 787.58
* **60-Day Moving Average:** 855.48

The price is currently below the 60-day moving average and above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages. This suggests a potential short-term upward trend, but a longer-term correction might be underway.  The difference between the closing price and the last market price (826.46 vs 826.71) is negligible and does not indicate a significant recent price jump or drop.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 78.75 –  This indicates the stock is in overbought territory, suggesting a potential short-term correction might be due.
* **PPO:** 1.46 – A positive PPO value indicates upward momentum.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +3.2 –  This shows short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 517.9% – This represents a projected long-term (2+ years) excess return relative to the S&P 500, assuming continued strong performance. However, this projection should be treated cautiously as it's highly dependent on the model used and can be influenced by market volatility.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant fluctuation in EPS and relatively stable revenue.

* **Revenue Growth:** Revenue generally shows growth, though with some minor quarter-to-quarter variation. There is no clear consistent upward or downward trend.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS shows substantial volatility, with both high positive and negative values.  The drastic changes in EPS highlight the potential risk associated with this investment.  Further analysis is necessary to understand the reasons behind these fluctuations.
* **Comparison:** Direct comparison of reported earnings with market expectations isn't possible without the expected EPS and revenue figures.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue is relatively stable, but with some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Profit margins are consistently high (around 80%), indicating strong profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows growth, although ROE is highly volatile. This fluctuation indicates significant changes in the company's profitability and possibly its capital structure. The negative ROE in Q3 2023 raises concerns that require further investigation.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires access to recent news articles and financial press releases to provide information on recent earnings news, market outlook, and analyst opinions.  No such information was provided.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY shows strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, this outperformance is accompanied by considerable risk, evidenced by the highly volatile EPS and ROE. The high RSI and relatively high PPO suggest potential short-term overbought conditions, hinting at a possible pullback. The extremely high projected long-term excess return should be interpreted with extreme caution, given its reliance on the model's assumptions and the volatile nature of the company's earnings.  Further investigation is crucial to understand the drivers behind the volatile earnings and ROE to assess the sustainability of its future performance.  The lack of recent news and analyst opinions prevents a fully comprehensive analysis.  Independent research into these factors, and an understanding of the company's underlying business and industry trends, is strongly recommended before making any investment decisions.
