## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a pharmaceutical company engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products.

The cumulative return of LLY is 516.30%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 118.37%.  The difference is 397.9 percentage points.  This places LLY's performance at the 64.1st percentile of its historical range relative to the S&P 500, based on the provided maximum and minimum divergence figures.  While this suggests strong outperformance, it's crucial to remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future results.  The provided alpha values of 0 across all periods suggest that this outperformance might not be entirely attributable to stock-picking skill (alpha) but possibly influenced by higher exposure to market factors (beta).

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $725.72
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $754.49
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $773.16
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $796.70

The price is currently below all three moving averages, indicating a potential downward trend. The recent price drop (-4.21% from the previous close) is substantial and warrants further investigation.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (31.34):**  Suggests the stock is currently in oversold territory. This could indicate a potential bounce, but it's not a guarantee.
* **PPO (-0.51):**  A negative PPO suggests bearish momentum.  This aligns with the current price action.
* **Relative Divergence:** The recent negative change in relative strength (-10.5%) points to a short-term downward trend.

Considering the current price drop of approximately -4.21%, the market is reflecting a negative event. The combination of negative price action, oversold RSI, and negative PPO suggests a high degree of uncertainty in the short-term. However, the projected long-term expected return of 151.1% significantly outpaces the S&P 500, indicating a potentially strong long-term investment opportunity *if* the market's current negative assessment is temporary.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant fluctuation in EPS and revenue. While the most recent quarter shows strong revenue ($11.44B), EPS is much lower than previous quarters.  There is also an unusual negative EPS reported in both October and November 2023, requiring further investigation to understand the underlying reasons. The revenue is generally consistent, hovering around the $9B to $11B mark.  A full analysis requires understanding these variations.  This volatility needs further investigation.


**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

The revenue figures are relatively stable across the reported quarters. Profit margins are consistently high, exceeding 80% in most quarters.  This is very high and may require further scrutiny to ensure accuracy and understand the factors contributing to such high margins.  The Equity and ROE data is more volatile, but ROE is generally high (except for the negative figure in 2023-09-30) suggesting high profitability compared to shareholder equity.  However, the high volatility suggests potential risk.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY shows significant long-term outperformance compared to the S&P 500, indicated by a high cumulative return and a positive long-term expected return.  However, the recent price drop, along with the negative PPO and the fluctuating earnings data (especially the negative EPS values), paint a picture of near-term uncertainty. The high profit margins reported need further investigation to ensure accuracy and understanding.  The technical indicators suggest the stock might be oversold, potentially setting up for a rebound.  A thorough fundamental analysis, particularly addressing the recent negative EPS figures and the extraordinarily high profit margins, is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The substantial positive long-term expected return could make it a compelling investment for long-term, risk-tolerant investors willing to weather short-term volatility.  However, the unexpected negative EPS requires further investigation.
