**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), a pharmaceutical company developing and manufacturing medicines and bio-medicines, significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the analyzed period.  The cumulative return for LLY is 653.79%, while VOO's is 130.81%.  This results in a substantial difference of 523.0 percentage points.  The relative divergence of 77.5% indicates LLY's performance is in the upper range of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.

* **Closing Price:** $825.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $812.79
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $786.06
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $857.26

The stock price is currently below its 60-day moving average and slightly above its 20-day and 5-day averages, suggesting a potential short-term correction after a recent upward trend. The last market price of 826.48 is within a typical daily fluctuation range, and does not indicate a significant jump or drop.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 61.45 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 1.46 (Positive; suggesting upward momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** NaN (-). This suggests a recent relative underperformance. However, without a value, further analysis is needed.  This should be re-examined for accuracy.
* **Expected Return:** 553.6%.  This exceptionally high projected return, relative to the S&P 500, should be viewed with caution.  While the past performance has been excellent, projecting such high future returns is highly speculative and unlikely to be realized, even with long-term investment.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has demonstrated exceptional performance relative to the S&P 500, with a remarkably high cumulative return over the analyzed period.  However, the high projected return and the variability in recent quarterly earnings and ROE warrant caution.  The substantial outperformance might not be sustainable in the future.  Further analysis is required, including accessing and analyzing missing data points (relative divergence, earnings expectations, analyst ratings), and understanding factors driving the volatility of ROE and EPS to provide a more holistic and reliable assessment of the company's prospects.  The provided data suggests a strong company with high profitability, but careful due diligence is required before making any investment decisions.
