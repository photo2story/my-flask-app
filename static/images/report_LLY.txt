**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $734.19
* **Last Market Price:** $732.26
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $776.99
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $816.23
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $831.52

The stock price is currently trading below all three moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.  The recent slight increase of $1.18 (from $723.73) is not significant enough to reverse the overall downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4883 (High Risk)
* **RSI:** 29.70 (Oversold territory, suggesting potential bounce, but not confirmed)
* **PPO:** -1.27 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **Recent (20-day) Relative Divergence Change:** +1.3 (Short-term upward trend, but within a larger downtrend context)

The combination of high MRI, low RSI, and negative PPO suggests caution.  While the short-term upward trend is present, the overall picture indicates bearish pressure. The price change of $1.18 does not represent a significant rebound.

* **Expected Return:** 72.4% (Long-term (2+ years) expected return exceeding the S&P 500). This high expected return needs to be considered in the context of high risk.

**6. Overall Analysis:**

LLY demonstrates strong long-term growth potential, supported by consistently high profit margins and increasing revenue.  However, the stock is currently experiencing a price decline, indicated by its position below moving averages and negative momentum indicators.  The high MDD highlights substantial risk.  The high expected return should be weighed against this risk.  A long-term (2+ years) investment strategy might be suitable for risk-tolerant investors.  However, close monitoring of market conditions and financial reports is crucial.  Further investigation into the reasons for recent EPS volatility is recommended before making investment decisions.
