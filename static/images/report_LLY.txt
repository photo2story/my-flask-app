**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Eli Lilly and Co. is a pharmaceutical company engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products.

The cumulative return for LLY is 592.56%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's cumulative return of 125.68%.  The difference in cumulative returns is 466.88%, placing it at the 69.58th percentile of its historical range against the S&P 500 (max difference: 681.71%, min difference: -24.55%).  This indicates a strong historical outperformance.  The provided CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) data further supports this, showing consistently high growth exceeding the market.

* **5-day Moving Average:** $748.29
* **20-day Moving Average:** $814.00
* **60-day Moving Average:** $880.39

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 34.34 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** -0.91 – A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **20-day Relative Divergence:** -20.63 – Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance against the S&P 500.
* **Expected Return:** 169.41% –  This represents the expected excess return over the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming continued outperformance.  This is a high projection and should be considered with caution.  The current price of $753.47, being only slightly above the last market price doesn't indicate any dramatic price swings (neither a sharp rebound nor a sharp drop).

**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided earnings data shows fluctuating EPS and revenue.  While revenue generally increased,  EPS shows significant variations including a negative EPS in 2023-11-02 and 2024-10-30.  Further investigation is needed to determine the reasons for these fluctuations.  Missing is a comparison with analyst expectations for the most recent earnings report (Oct 30, 2024). This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the actual performance relative to market expectations.

**5. Financial Ratios:**

The provided financial data reveals a consistently high profit margin (around 80%) suggesting strong profitability. However, Return on Equity (ROE) fluctuates considerably, highlighting potential variability in the efficiency of capital utilization.  Further analysis is required to understand the reasons behind these fluctuations.

**7. Summary:**

LLY has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests a downward trend, supported by technical indicators (RSI and PPO) showing oversold and bearish signals.  While the long-term expected return is high, the fluctuating financial performance (particularly EPS) and the need for clarification on the October 30th, 2024 earnings report against expectations requires further investigation before drawing definitive conclusions. The current negative short term trend is a concern.  Analyzing recent news and analyst opinions is crucial for a complete picture.
