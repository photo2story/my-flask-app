**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has historically significantly outperformed the S&P 500, showing strong long-term growth potential.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term correction.  While the company displays strong profitability and revenue growth in the longer term, the volatility in EPS and ROE warrants closer examination. The lack of recent news and analyst opinions hinders a comprehensive assessment.  The high projected long-term return is compelling, but potential short-term risks should be considered. Further investigation into the causes of EPS and ROE volatility and the availability of recent news is highly recommended.

**8.  Recommendations:**

Given the data provided, a long-term investment strategy could be considered, but only after further investigation to understand the recent fluctuations in the EPS and ROE and confirmation of the high projected return via other reliable sources.  Close monitoring of the stock's performance and any news affecting the company is crucial.  The high beta should also be acknowledged as representing a greater sensitivity to overall market movements.
