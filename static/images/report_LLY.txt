## Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) Stock Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a leading pharmaceutical company.  The provided data shows significantly higher cumulative returns compared to the S&P 500 (VOO), with strong growth indicators but also some risk factors to consider.  Detailed analysis follows.


**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

LLY has substantially outperformed the S&P 500.  The cumulative return for LLY is 322.13%, while VOO's is 82.57%. This results in a current divergence of 239.6%, placing it in the 72.9th percentile of historical divergence relative to the S&P 500.


The Alpha/Beta analysis reveals consistently positive alpha (outperformance relative to the market) across the observed periods, with the beta (market sensitivity) generally increasing over time, indicating growing market correlation.  The significant increase in CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and market capitalization (Cap(B)) suggests strong and accelerating growth.  However, the high Maximum Drawdown (MDD) figures in the later years indicate considerable risk and potential for significant price drops.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** 859.73
* **5-day Moving Average:** 834.93
* **20-day Moving Average:** 784.95
* **60-day Moving Average:** 833.62

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The relatively small gap between the 5-day and 60-day averages indicates a relatively stable, albeit upward trending, short-to-medium term trend.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4053 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 59.94 (Slightly above neutral; not overbought)
* **PPO:** 1.75 (Positive; suggesting upward momentum)
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** 4.1 (+), indicating short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return:** 76.3% (Long-term, 2+ years, exceeding S&P 500).

The indicators suggest a generally positive outlook, but the medium risk level warrants caution.  The high expected return is a significant positive, but it's crucial to remember that this is a forecast and not a guarantee.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS    | Revenue          |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| 2025-05-01 | 3.07   | 12.73 B$         |
| 2024-10-30 | 1.08   | 11.44 B$         |
| 2024-08-08 | 3.29   | 11.30 B$         |
| 2024-04-30 | 2.49   | 8.77 B$          |
| 2025-05-01 | 2.49   | 8.77 B$          |

There's some inconsistency and potential duplication in the provided data (two entries for 2025-05-01).  Revenue seems relatively stable, while EPS fluctuates considerably.  More complete and consistent data is needed for a thorough earnings analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

The absence of "Total Revenue" and "Gross Profit" data prevents a comprehensive financial statement analysis. This missing information is a significant limitation to the overall assessment.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LLY exhibits strong historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500. Technical indicators suggest a positive short-to-medium term outlook, and the projected long-term return is substantial. However, the high MDD figures and the medium risk level highlight significant potential for volatility and downside risk.  The lack of complete financial information and inconsistencies in the earnings data limit the robustness of the analysis.  Further investigation into the financial statements and clarification of the earnings data are crucial before making any investment decisions.  The high projected returns should be viewed cautiously, considering the inherent risks in the pharmaceutical sector and the volatility suggested by the MDD figures.
