The slightly higher Last-market price (822.45) than the current price (822.41), with a small price change of 0.29, does not indicate any major price volatility or immediate trend change.  The large difference between the 60-day moving average and the 5 and 20-day moving averages suggests that the price is in a recent uptrend after a period of lower pricing.
