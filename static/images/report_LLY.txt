## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Analysis Report

This report analyzes Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), a pharmaceutical company, based on the provided data.  Note that this analysis is limited to the information provided and may not reflect a complete picture of the company's financial health and prospects.


**1. Performance vs. S&P 500 (VOO):**

Eli Lilly's cumulative return (552.85%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (114.36%). The difference is 438.5%, placing it at the 70.3rd percentile of its historical performance range against the S&P 500. This indicates a strong relative performance.  The provided CAGR data further supports this, showing consistently high growth rates exceeding the market significantly. The alpha of 0.0 suggests that the excess return might be attributable to systematic risk rather than managerial skill. However, the beta indicates high volatility relative to the market.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $764.71
* **5-day Moving Average:** $778.76
* **20-day Moving Average:** $788.37
* **60-day Moving Average:** $839.16

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downward trend.

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 40.42 (Below 50, suggesting bearish momentum)
* **PPO:** -0.08 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.8% (Short-term downward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 575.4% (significantly higher than S&P 500, reflecting the historical outperformance and potentially high risk given the high beta).  The current price ($764.71) being below recent moving averages does not indicate a dramatic price change (no 급반등 or 급하락 observed).  The high expected return must be viewed in the context of the historical data and inherent risk.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant variability in both EPS and revenue:

* **Revenue:** Revenue shows fluctuating growth, with a peak in the most recent quarter ($11.44B), followed by a slight drop from the previous ($11.30B) and a more significant decrease in earlier quarters.  There isn't a consistent upward trend over the period provided.
* **EPS:** EPS displays significant volatility, fluctuating between strong positive values (e.g., $3.29 in 2024-08-08) and negative values (e.g., -$0.06 in 2023-11-02 and 2024-10-30), lacking a clear trend. There's no information to compare against expectations.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue is generally high and fluctuates somewhat. Profit margins remain consistently high (around 80%), indicating strong profitability.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows growth, with fluctuations in ROE that are high in some quarters and negative in one.  This suggests some volatility in profitability and return on investment.


**6. News and Recent Issues:**

No recent news (within the last 2 days) or analyst opinions are provided.  The market outlook is also not available in this data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has demonstrated exceptionally strong historical returns significantly outperforming the S&P 500. However, recent price action suggests a possible downward trend, supported by bearish technical indicators (RSI and PPO).  Earnings show considerable variability with no clear trend in revenue or EPS.  While profitability margins are strong, ROE fluctuates considerably. The substantial projected long-term return should be considered cautiously, taking into account the volatility suggested by the beta and recent price movement.  More information (like analyst forecasts, news, and recent market conditions) is needed for a comprehensive evaluation of the current investment outlook.

Independent research and consultation with a financial advisor are recommended before making any investment decisions.
