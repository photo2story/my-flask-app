## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a leading pharmaceutical company engaged in the research, development, and manufacturing of pharmaceutical products.  Over the period analyzed, LLY's cumulative return (594.02%) significantly outperformed the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return (128.31%). The difference is 465.71%, placing it at the 69.42% percentile of its historical performance range against the S&P 500.  This indicates strong relative performance compared to the broader market.  The provided Alpha values consistently positive, further supporting this conclusion.  Beta values generally close to 0.7 suggest a moderate sensitivity to market movements.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $755.0 (Last Market: $754.16)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $747.21
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $792.89
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $870.54

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (39.1):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce.
* **PPO (-0.33):** Shows a bearish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-19.63):** Shows a recent short-term decline.

The combination of RSI and PPO signals suggest a possible short-term reversal but longer-term outlook requires caution. The expected return of 169.98% over the long term (2+ years) compared to the S&P 500 is a substantial positive prediction, however, relying solely on this prediction is risky.  The last market price of $754.16 doesn't indicate a significant recent sharp movement (up or down).


**4. Recent Financial Performance and Outlook:**

The provided earnings data shows mixed results:

| Date       | EPS     | Revenue      | Notes                                   |
|------------|---------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $1.08   | $11.44 B     |                                        |
| 2024-08-08 | $3.29   | $11.30 B     |                                        |
| 2024-04-30 | $2.49   | $8.77 B      |                                        |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.06  | $9.50 B      |                                        |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.06  | $9.50 B      | Duplicate entry, likely an error        |


Revenue generally seems consistent, but EPS shows significant volatility, requiring further investigation into the reasons behind these fluctuations (e.g., one-time charges, seasonal effects).  A comparison with analyst expectations for the most recent quarter is crucial for a complete assessment.  The duplicate entry for October 30th 2024 requires clarification.

**5. Financial Ratios Analysis:**

1) **Revenue and Profitability:**  The company demonstrates consistently high profit margins (around 80%) over the past year. Revenue has been relatively stable with a slight dip in Q1 2024.

2) **Capital and Profitability:** Return on Equity (ROE) shows substantial fluctuation, with a negative ROE in Q3 2023 and high positive ROEs in other quarters.  This volatility needs further investigation to understand the underlying reasons.  Equity has grown steadily over the period.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* **Missing Information:**  The prompt requested analysis of recent earnings news from sources like Shacknews and Finbold, but no specific news articles or links were provided.  Therefore, I cannot offer an analysis of recent market outlook, analyst opinions, or performance highlights based on current news.  To provide this section, please supply relevant news articles.

**7. Overall Summary:**

LLY has demonstrated strong outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the given period, supported by generally positive Alpha values. However, recent price action suggests a downtrend, while technical indicators show mixed signals.  Financial data show high profitability but significant volatility in EPS and ROE.  Further analysis is required to understand the drivers of this volatility and to incorporate current news and analyst opinions for a complete picture.  The high predicted long-term return should be viewed cautiously without thorough supporting analysis.  The absence of current news and analyst commentary significantly hinders a comprehensive evaluation.

**8. Recommendations:**

A more thorough investigation is needed.  Specifically, access to current analyst reports, recent news, and clarified financial data (addressing the duplicate entry) would enable a more informed assessment.  Given the mixed signals from price action, technical indicators, and the volatile financial performance, a conservative approach is advised.  Thoroughly investigate the causes behind the EPS and ROE fluctuations.  Compare reported earnings to analyst expectations.  Include recent news and analyst opinions.
