Equity shows growth, but ROE fluctuates significantly, indicating potential variability in profitability.


**6) Overall Analysis:**

LLY has shown remarkably strong growth exceeding the S&P 500 significantly.  However, this growth is accompanied by substantial volatility as reflected in high MDDs and fluctuating EPS and ROE.  While technical indicators suggest potential for a short-term bounce (oversold RSI), the negative PPO and price being below moving averages indicate bearish momentum.  The high expected long-term return is encouraging but relies on the assumption that LLY's past outperformance continues.  Further investigation into the drivers of earnings volatility and the sustainability of high profit margins is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The duplicated data point in the earnings report needs clarification.  A thorough due diligence process including a deeper examination of the company's financial statements, competitive landscape, and future growth prospects is recommended.
