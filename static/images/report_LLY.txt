## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and markets pharmaceutical products.  As of the last reported data point, LLY's cumulative return is 566.19%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 121.78%. The difference is 444.4%, placing it at the 71.2nd percentile of its historical range of outperformance relative to the S&P 500 (max: 634.8%, min: -25.2%).  The provided Alpha values of 0.0 suggest that the outperformance is not solely attributable to factors outside of market movements (beta is a measure of market risk, and a beta of 1 means the stock moves in line with the market). However, the provided data does not include the methodology used to calculate alpha and the significant increase in beta over time suggests a correlation to market risk.  Further analysis is required to properly evaluate this.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant volatility:

* **EPS:**  Fluctuates widely, with a substantial drop to -$0.06 in Q4 2023 and Q4 2024, followed by a strong rebound in subsequent quarters.  There is insufficient information to assess whether these earnings beat or missed expectations.
* **Revenue:**  Generally increasing, though with some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Q3 2024 revenue is the highest reported figure.

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:** Revenue remains relatively stable, with a consistent high profit margin above 80% in most quarters.  The relatively flat revenue growth may signal a saturation of the market and needs further investigation.
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has been increasing, though ROE shows significant fluctuation, suggesting changes in profitability and investment strategies. The -0.51% ROE in Q3 2023 is particularly notable and should be further investigated.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

* No specific news or analyst opinions are provided within the data set. Information on recent market outlooks and analyst opinions would require external research.  Absence of recent earnings news within the last 2 days is noted.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has shown a remarkable historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downtrend, despite a positive long-term outlook.  Earnings data exhibits substantial volatility, needing further clarification and context.  The high and consistent profit margins are positive, but revenue growth appears to be stagnating.  The significantly high historic Alpha, requires more data for analysis. More research is needed to fully assess the financial health and potential future performance of LLY, considering recent market trends and analyst sentiment.
