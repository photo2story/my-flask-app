## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a pharmaceutical company developing and manufacturing medicines and biologics.  The cumulative return of LLY (568.25%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (115.41%) over the analyzed period. The difference is 452.8%, placing it at the 72.4th percentile of historical divergence relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates strong outperformance, but the relative divergence is a measure of past performance relative to the S&P 500, not a predictor of future performance. The provided alpha values of 0.0 suggest that the outperformance is not solely due to factors independent of market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $786.89
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $777.07
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $780.76
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $812.01

The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent upward momentum. However, it's below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term pullback from a higher recent peak.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 53.11 -  Suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions; the market is relatively neutral.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.14 - A positive value indicates upward momentum, but it's relatively low, suggesting the momentum might be weakening.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** +1.1 -  Indicates short-term upward price movement.
* **Expected Return:** 116.4% - This represents a significant projected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years) if a buy-and-hold strategy is adopted.  This should be viewed with caution as it is a projection, not a guarantee.  The current price of $786.89 does not immediately signal a major event (rapid increase or decrease).

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has demonstrated significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the analyzed period.  High profit margins and generally robust revenue suggest a financially strong company.

The lack of recent news and analyst opinions limits the scope of this analysis.  Additional data is needed for a more comprehensive evaluation.
