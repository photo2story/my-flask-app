## Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) Stock Performance Review

**0. Key Figures & Initial Analysis:**

LLY, Eli Lilly and Co., is a leading pharmaceutical company.  The provided data shows significantly higher returns for LLY compared to the S&P 500 (VOO) over various periods.  Further analysis is required to determine the sustainability of this outperformance.

**1. Cumulative Return Comparison:**

* **LLY Cumulative Return:** 677.54%
* **VOO (S&P 500) Cumulative Return:** 116.17%
* **Return Difference:** 561.4%  (This indicates LLY significantly outperformed VOO.)
* **Relative Divergence:** 88.9% (This places LLY's performance in the top 88.9% of its historical range relative to VOO.  It doesn't imply a 88.9% outperformance consistently.)

The Alpha and Beta analysis in the table shows increasing Alpha (outperformance relative to the market) and consistent positive Beta (market sensitivity) over time, suggesting LLY's growth has been partly driven by market factors but also by significant company-specific performance. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) also shows significant growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $920.63
* **Last Market Price:** $932.65 (a $12.02 increase)
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $904.80
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $867.09
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $811.06

The price is above all three moving averages, suggesting an upward trend.  The recent increase of $12.02 indicates a positive market response, possibly triggered by positive news or strong recent earnings.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 65.17 (Slightly above the neutral 50, suggesting the stock is in overbought territory, but not excessively so.)
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.38 (Positive, indicating upward momentum.)
* **Recent Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +6.3% (Short-term upward trend.)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 80.1% (Significant outperformance relative to S&P 500 is expected over a longer term.)  This implies high growth potential but carries inherent risk given the exceptionally high expected return.

The price increase from the previous close (implied in `Last-market`) shows a positive short-term momentum, potentially contributing to the higher RSI.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue       |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $1.08    | $11.44B       |
| 2024-08-08 | $3.29    | $11.30B       |
| 2024-04-30 | $2.49    | $8.77B        |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.06   | $9.50B        |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.06   | $9.50B        |

There appears to be a duplicated entry for 2024-10-30.  Excluding the duplicate, earnings show volatility but a generally upward trend in revenue and profitability, with a notable spike in EPS in August 2024.  Further investigation into the reasons for the negative EPS in November 2023 is warranted.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue    | Profit Margin |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $13.53B    | 82.24%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $11.44B    | 81.02%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $11.30B    | 80.80%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.77B     | 80.91%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.35B     | 80.88%        |

Revenue and profit margins have been consistently high and show a growth trend.

**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity     | ROE           |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $14.19B    | 31.07%        |
| 2024-09-30 | $14.24B    | 6.81%         |
| 2024-06-30 | $13.56B    | 21.88%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $12.81B    | 17.51%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $10.77B    | 20.33%        |

Equity has increased, while ROE shows some volatility but generally remains positive and reflects strong profitability.  The significant drop in ROE in Q3 2024 needs further examination.


**6. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has demonstrated exceptional performance relative to the S&P 500, indicated by significantly higher cumulative returns and a consistently positive alpha.  Positive momentum is supported by technical indicators and recent price action.  Strong financial statements show high revenue, profit margins, and increasing equity.  However, the volatility in EPS and ROE, particularly the significant drop in Q3 2024 ROE, requires further investigation.  The exceptionally high projected return of 80.1% for the next 2+ years implies very high growth expectations, and investors should proceed with caution, considering that such high growth is not guaranteed and involves considerable risk.  Thorough due diligence, including analysis of the factors behind the Q3 ROE drop and future market conditions, is crucial before making any investment decisions.
