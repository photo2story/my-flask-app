This report analyzes Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY), a leading pharmaceutical company, based on the provided data.  Note that this analysis is based solely on the provided data and may not encompass all relevant factors for a complete investment decision.  Independent research and consideration of external factors are strongly recommended.


**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Eli Lilly's cumulative return (565.87%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500's cumulative return (120.85%) over the analyzed period.  The difference is 445.02%, placing it at the 71.2th percentile of the historical spread between LLY and VOO. This indicates strong relative performance. The provided CAGR data further supports this, showing consistently high growth rates significantly exceeding the S&P 500's typical return.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $778.62
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $785.02
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $786.63
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $840.90

The current price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (45.12):**  Approaching oversold territory (below 50), suggesting potential for a bounce.
* **PPO (0.09):**  Positive, indicating bullish momentum, although relatively weak.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence (-2.8%):** Shows a recent short-term decline in relative performance.
* **Expected Return (567.5%):** This represents a significant expected outperformance against the S&P 500 over a long-term (2+ years) investment horizon, assuming continued strong performance.  However, this projection should be treated with caution as it is based on past performance, which is not necessarily indicative of future results.  The current price of $778.62, being below the moving averages, doesn't suggest immediate significant upward or downward movements, although the RSI suggests it could be nearing a possible bounce.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data reveals significant fluctuation in EPS and relatively stable revenue.

* **Latest Quarterly Results:** The most recent quarter (2024-10-30) shows a significant decrease in EPS ($1.08) compared to the previous quarter ($3.29) and a slight decrease in revenue. The previous two quarters had higher EPS and revenue. The very last entry on October 30 is identical to an entry on November 2 (2023).  There is an apparent inconsistency or duplication in this data that needs clarification.
* **Revenue Growth Trends:** Revenue has remained relatively stable, but there's no clear upward trend displayed across the quarters.
* **EPS Trends:** EPS shows substantial volatility, with significant drops followed by increases.  Clarification is needed on the Oct 30th data duplication.
* **Beats or Misses:**  Without expectations data, it's impossible to determine whether the earnings results beat or missed expectations.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue fluctuates, but profit margins remain consistently high (around 80%).
* **Capital and Profitability:** Equity has shown growth, but ROE exhibits considerable volatility, indicating fluctuating profitability. The negative ROE in 2023-09-30 is notable and requires further investigation.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires information on recent earnings news (within the past 2 days), market outlook, and analyst opinions, which is missing from the provided data.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

Eli Lilly (LLY) has demonstrated exceptionally strong historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  However, recent price action suggests a potential short-term downturn.  Earnings data shows inconsistent EPS with relatively stable revenue, and the ROE is volatile. Technical indicators offer mixed signals.  Further investigation is needed to address data inconsistencies (EPS and Revenue figures from 2024-10-30 and 2023-11-02 seem to be duplicated), obtain missing information (market outlook, analyst opinions, and earnings news within 2 days of the report's creation date), and to clarify the expected return projection.  A thorough analysis considering additional factors (industry trends, competitive landscape, regulatory environment) is necessary before making any investment decision.
