## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Review

**1. Performance Relative to S&P 500 (VOO):**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a pharmaceutical company that develops and manufactures medicines and biomedicines.

The cumulative return for LLY is 579.29%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (VOO) with a cumulative return of 112.20%.  The difference is 467.1%, placing it at the 74.6th percentile of the historical range of its outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  This indicates a substantial outperformance, historically speaking.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $799.90
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $781.50
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $780.79
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $809.88

The current price is slightly above the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting recent upward momentum. However, it is below the 60-day moving average, indicating a potential short-term pullback from a previous higher price point.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 63.34 – Suggests the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a neutral to slightly bullish sentiment.
* **PPO:** 0.32 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum.
* **20-Day Relative Divergence:** +3.0 –  This confirms short-term upward momentum.
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 109.6% –  This represents the projected excess return over the S&P 500 for long-term (2+ years) investment.  This is a very high expected return, and should be considered with appropriate caution.  This figure is likely based on past performance, and future performance is not guaranteed to match expectations.  The high number might stem from the unusually high recent performance of the stock.

The current price of $799.90 doesn't inherently indicate a rapid upward or downward trend given its relationship to moving averages.  The high expected return needs further contextualization based on the assumptions used to generate it.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| Date       | EPS      | Revenue          |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 2024-10-30 | $1.08    | $11.44 Billion   |
| 2024-08-08 | $3.29    | $11.30 Billion   |
| 2024-04-30 | $2.49    | $8.77 Billion    |
| 2023-11-02 | -$0.06   | $9.50 Billion    |
| 2024-10-30 | -$0.06   | $9.50 Billion    |

There seems to be an error in the data; the same date (2024-10-30) appears twice, one with positive EPS and one with negative EPS.  This needs clarification.  Revenue appears relatively stable, though there are some fluctuations between quarters.  Further analysis requires accurate data.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Revenue      | Profit Margin |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $11.44 Billion | 81.02%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $11.30 Billion | 80.80%        |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.77 Billion  | 80.91%        |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.35 Billion  | 80.88%        |
| 2023-09-30 | $9.50 Billion  | 80.42%        |

Revenue shows some variability, however profit margins remain consistently high, suggesting strong profitability and efficient operations.


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter    | Equity        | ROE            |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| 2024-09-30 | $14.24 Billion | 6.81%          |
| 2024-06-30 | $13.56 Billion | 21.88%         |
| 2024-03-31 | $12.81 Billion | 17.51%         |
| 2023-12-31 | $10.77 Billion | 20.33%         |
| 2023-09-30 | $11.22 Billion | -0.51%         |

Equity has generally increased, but ROE fluctuates, indicating variability in the return generated on shareholder equity.  The negative ROE in 2023-09-30 is noteworthy and requires further investigation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the analyzed period, showing strong historical performance.  Recent price action suggests some consolidation after a period of growth.  Technical indicators are generally positive, though the high expected return needs further scrutiny.  Financial information indicates high and consistent profitability, although some inconsistencies require clarification (duplicate data entry and fluctuating ROE).  A comprehensive analysis requires reviewing the corrected earnings data and understanding the factors driving the highly optimistic projected long-term return.  Independent verification of this projection is crucial before investment decisions are made.  The high expected return should be considered in context of the inherent risk in all investments and specifically the unusually high historical outperformance.
