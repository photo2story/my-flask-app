## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Analysis Report

**0. Executive Summary:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a leading pharmaceutical company.  Its stock has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (VOO) over the observed period. While recent price action shows some weakness, strong financial performance and high expected returns suggest a potentially favorable long-term investment opportunity. However, investors should carefully consider the high beta and recent market risk indicators.

**1. Performance Comparison & Alpha/Beta Analysis:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) shows a cumulative return of 273.19%, significantly exceeding the S&P 500's (VOO) cumulative return of 66.27%. The difference (206.9%) places LLY at the 68.9th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500, based on a historical range of 312.7% to -27.7%.

The provided alpha/beta analysis reveals high growth (CAGR consistently above the market), but also considerable maximum drawdown (MDD).  The consistently positive alpha indicates consistent outperformance relative to the market benchmark, with beta values fluctuating but mostly above 1, indicating higher volatility than the market.  Market capitalization also shows significant growth.


| Year       | CAGR | MDD  | Alpha | Beta | Cap(B) |

| 2015-2017  | 10.0% | 55.6% | -19.0% | 0.1 | 67.7 |
| 2016-2018  | 38.0% | 58.6% | 20.0% | -0.1 | 95.1 |
| 2017-2019  | 49.0% | 58.6% | 19.0% | 0.3 | 110.4 |
| 2018-2020  | 51.0% | 58.6% | 25.0% | 0.2 | 144.7 |
| 2019-2021  | 105.0% | 60.7% | 50.0% | 0.3 | 240.3 |
| 2020-2022  | 100.0% | 65.0% | 94.0% | 0.3 | 322.6 |
| 2021-2023  | 138.0% | 65.0% | 122.0% | 0.3 | 519.2 |
| 2022-2024  | 156.0% | 72.1% | 139.0% | 0.3 | 692.0 |

**2. Recent Price Action:**

* **Closing Price:** $757.18
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $743.71
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $792.53
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $829.35

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a short-term downtrend.  The recent slight increase (0.38) is not significant enough to suggest a reversal.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **Market Risk Indicator (MRI):** 0.4175 (Medium Risk)
* **RSI:** 35.29 (Suggests oversold conditions, potential for a bounce)
* **PPO:** -0.4651 (Negative, indicating bearish momentum)
* **20-Day Relative Divergence Change:** -2.8 (Short-term bearish trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 78.1% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 expected)

The combination of a low RSI, negative PPO, and negative relative divergence suggests a bearish short-term outlook, although the oversold RSI hints at potential bounce.  The high expected return suggests long-term potential, outweighing current negative indicators. The slight positive daily change is not significant enough to indicate a major price shift.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows considerable volatility in EPS, with some very strong quarters and one negative quarter.  Revenue generally shows upward trajectory, but with some variability.  More context is needed for a complete analysis (e.g., specific reasons for the negative EPS quarter, seasonality effects).

| Date       | EPS   | Revenue       |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 2024-10-30 | 1.08  | $11.44 B      |
| 2024-08-08 | 3.29  | $11.30 B      |
| 2024-04-30 | 2.49  | $8.77 B       |
| 2023-11-02 | -0.06 | $9.50 B       |
| 2024-10-30 | -0.06 | $9.50 B       |


**5. Financial Information:**

Both Revenue and Profitability metrics show consistent strong performance with high profit margins throughout the reported quarters, indicating strong financial health.  Equity shows growth, and ROE demonstrates periods of excellent return, although some quarters show lower values.  Further investigation is required to understand the fluctuations in ROE.

**Revenue and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Revenue | Profit Margin |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $13.53B | 82.24%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $11.44B | 81.02%       |
| 2024-06-30 | $11.30B | 80.80%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $8.77B  | 80.91%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $9.35B  | 80.88%       |


**Capital and Profitability:**

| Quarter | Equity    | ROE          |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| 2024-12-31 | $14.19B  | 31.07%       |
| 2024-09-30 | $14.24B  | 6.81%        |
| 2024-06-30 | $13.56B  | 21.88%       |
| 2024-03-31 | $12.81B  | 17.51%       |
| 2023-12-31 | $10.77B  | 20.33%       |


**6. Overall Conclusion:**

LLY demonstrates a strong historical performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500. While recent short-term indicators suggest a bearish trend, the high expected return (78.1% over 2+ years), strong financial fundamentals, and consistently positive alpha make it a potentially attractive long-term investment.  However, the high beta and observed volatility warrant careful consideration of risk tolerance.  Further analysis of the factors behind EPS fluctuations and ROE variations is recommended before making an investment decision.
