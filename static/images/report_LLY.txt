## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison with S&P 500 (VOO):**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company that researches, develops, manufactures, and markets pharmaceutical products.

The cumulative return of LLY is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference in cumulative returns as of the last data point is 444.7%, indicating a substantial outperformance.  The relative divergence (71.2%) places LLY's performance in the upper percentiles of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500.  The provided alpha values consistently show 0.0, indicating the company's returns are largely in line with market performance, despite the significant outperformance.  This suggests that market timing and sector specific factors heavily impacted the returns.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $773.84
* **5-day Moving Average:** $788.62
* **20-day Moving Average:** $792.83
* **60-day Moving Average:** $825.99

The stock price is currently below all three moving averages, suggesting a potential short-term downward trend.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI (Relative Strength Index):** 37.69 – This indicates the stock is currently in oversold territory.
* **PPO (Percentage Price Oscillator):** 0.16 – A positive value suggests bullish momentum, but close to neutral.
* **Recent Relative Divergence:** +0.9 – Short-term upward movement in relative strength.
* **Expected Return:** 118.8% – This represents a significant projected outperformance against the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years), assuming continued strong performance.  The current price of 773.84 being below recent moving averages does not fully reflect the long term positive expectations.  This is a potential buy signal for longer term buy and hold strategies.  Rapid upward movements should be treated as short term gains unless other supporting financial information shows a fundamental change in the financial performance of the company.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The provided earnings data shows significant variability in EPS and relatively stable revenue.  While revenue fluctuates, it maintains a generally upward trend. EPS shows considerable volatility, with a large jump from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024 but a negative EPS number in Q4 2023.  Without further information, including the market expectations for these quarters, it is impossible to definitively classify these results as "beats" or "misses."

**5. Financial Information Analysis:**

* **Revenue:** Shows relatively consistent revenue generation with some minor fluctuations.
* **Profit Margin:** Remains remarkably stable and high throughout the reported periods.
* **Equity:** Shows an upward trend, except for a decrease between Q3 and Q4 2023.
* **ROE (Return on Equity):** Exhibits significant volatility, reaching highs of over 20% but also experiencing a negative value in Q3 2023.  This volatility could reflect significant changes in company operations and accounting practices.

**6. News and Recent Issues:**

This section requires access to recent news sources and financial analysis websites to provide information on any recent earnings news releases within the last two days, market outlook for LLY, and analyst opinions.  This information is not available to this LLM.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY exhibits strong long-term performance significantly outperforming the S&P 500. While recent price action suggests a potential short-term pullback, the oversold RSI and positive PPO indicate potential for a rebound.  The high and consistent profit margins and generally increasing revenue demonstrate the underlying strength of the business.  However, the volatility in EPS and ROE warrants further investigation into the underlying drivers of these fluctuations. The projected long-term outperformance is encouraging for long-term investors, but short-term volatility should be considered.  Further analysis using company financial statements and industry research will provide a more complete picture of LLY's future prospects.
