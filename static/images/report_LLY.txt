## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Review

**1. Performance Comparison and Divergence:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company that researches, develops, manufactures, and markets pharmaceutical products.

The cumulative return of LLY is 566.99%, while the S&P 500 (VOO) shows a cumulative return of 122.16%.  The difference in cumulative returns is **444.8%**.  The relative divergence of 71.2% indicates that LLY's performance significantly outpaces the S&P 500 based on the historical range of divergence.  This suggests strong outperformance, but it's crucial to remember that past performance doesn't guarantee future results.  The provided alpha values of 0.0 across all periods suggest that the outperformance might be primarily attributable to market-wide factors (beta).

**Alpha and Beta Analysis:** The provided data shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) values for LLY, indicating strong growth over the analyzed periods.  However, the Alpha consistently being 0.0 suggests this growth is largely due to market movements (Beta), rather than company-specific factors.  The high Beta values indicate significant sensitivity to market fluctuations.  The Maximum Drawdown (MDD) values also highlight periods of significant losses, though these have been recovered over time.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $785.41
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $754.81
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $771.26
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $787.66

The price is above both the 5-day and 20-day moving averages, suggesting a short-term uptrend. However, it's slightly below the 60-day moving average, which could indicate some potential for a pullback. The recent price increase reflects a strong performance compared to the closing price on the previous day (change of 2.45%).

**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 51.71 (Slightly above neutral; neither overbought nor oversold)
* **PPO:** 0.16 (Positive, suggesting bullish momentum)
* **Relative Divergence Change (20-day):** +2.6 (Short-term upward trend)
* **Expected Return (2+ years):** 123.4% (Significant outperformance relative to the S&P 500 is anticipated with long-term investment).  The recent price change is likely contributing to this expected return, it is important to note this is a projected value not a guarantee.

The positive PPO and recent price increase support the bullish momentum. The RSI indicates a neutral position, suggesting thereâ€™s potential for further upward movement.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data is inconsistent.  There are duplicate entries for Oct 30, 2024, and a significant drop in EPS and a negligible revenue change in November 2023 compared to the following quarters.  This inconsistency needs further investigation to ensure data accuracy.  Further analysis requires a consistent and complete dataset.


**5. Financial Information:**

**Revenue and Profitability:**  Revenue remains relatively stable, with a slight dip in Q1 2024.  Profit margins are consistently high, indicating strong profitability.

**Capital and Profitability:** Equity shows growth, but ROE is volatile, dropping significantly in Q3 2023 before recovering strongly in subsequent quarters. This variation suggests factors influencing profitability that warrant further investigation.


**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY exhibits strong growth exceeding the S&P 500 considerably. While the high Beta suggests vulnerability to market changes, the long-term performance has been impressive. The recent price increase and positive momentum indicators are encouraging.  However, inconsistencies in earnings data and volatility in ROE require further examination before drawing conclusive judgements.  The significant positive expected return is compelling, but relies heavily on the continuing performance of the company, and long-term investment carries its own set of risks.  Further due diligence is needed before making investment decisions.  The unusually high CAGR numbers, with a consistent 0.0 alpha, requires a careful investigation into how these figures were calculated.

Investment decisions should be made after thorough due diligence and consultation with a qualified financial advisor.  The data used in this analysis is only as reliable as the sources provided, therefore inconsistencies in data need further investigation for increased reliability.
