## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Divergence:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company engaged in the research, development, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products.

The cumulative return of LLY (594.02%) significantly outperforms the S&P 500 (VOO) cumulative return (128.31%).  The difference is 465.7%, placing it at the 69.4th percentile of its historical performance relative to the S&P 500 based on the provided data's range of maximum and minimum differences.  This indicates LLY has historically outperformed the S&P 500 by a considerable margin.

The provided Alpha and Beta analysis shows consistently high Alpha values (above 1.0), suggesting that LLY has generated returns exceeding what would be expected based solely on its market risk (Beta).  The Beta values, while fluctuating, generally remain above 1, indicating higher volatility than the overall market.  The company's market capitalization (Cap(B)) shows substantial growth over the analyzed period.


**2. Recent Price Movement:**

* **Closing Price:** $755.0 (Last Market: $787.84) - Note the closing price is lower than the last market price indicating a recent decline.
* **5-day Moving Average:** $747.21
* **20-day Moving Average:** $792.89
* **60-day Moving Average:** $870.54

The price is below all three moving averages, suggesting a downtrend.  The significant gap between the current price and the 60-day moving average highlights a considerable price decline from recent highs.


**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI (39.1):**  Indicates the stock is in oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce is possible. However, this is not a definitive buy signal.
* **PPO (-0.33):**  A negative value suggests bearish momentum.
* **Relative Divergence (-19.7):** Shows a recent decline in relative strength.  The negative divergence, combined with the negative PPO, reinforces the bearish momentum.
* **Expected Return (612.3%):**  Represents a significant projected outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the long term (2+ years). However, it's crucial to remember that this is an *expected* return, not a guaranteed one.  The significant last-market price drop needs to be carefully considered in relation to this forecast.  A drop from $787.84 to $755.0 may suggest that some near-term negative news has impacted the price and this should be investigated.


**4. Recent Financial Performance:**

The provided EPS and revenue figures show significant fluctuations.  While some quarters exhibit strong EPS and revenue growth, others show declines or even negative EPS (e.g., 2023-11-02 and 2024-10-30).  It's crucial to compare these figures to analyst expectations for a complete picture.  Missing earnings expectations for the latest report (2024-10-30) is a critical piece of missing information needed for a robust analysis.


**5. Financial Information:**

* **Revenue and Profitability:**  Shows consistently high profit margins (around 80%) despite fluctuations in revenue.
* **Capital and Profitability:**  Fluctuations in Return on Equity (ROE) are observed, with some quarters showcasing high ROE while others show low or even negative values. This volatility requires further investigation into the underlying causes.

A deeper dive into the financial statements is required for a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial health.

**8. Summary:**

LLY exhibits strong historical outperformance against the S&P 500, indicated by a substantial cumulative return difference and consistently high alpha values. However, recent price action suggests a bearish trend, with the price below key moving averages.  Technical indicators paint a mixed picture, with the RSI suggesting potential oversold conditions, while the PPO and negative relative divergence point to bearish momentum. The financial performance displays volatility, requiring analysis of analyst expectations for complete context.  The high expected return requires considering the significant recent price decline.  A thorough review of recent news and analyst opinions is crucial before making any investment decisions.  The lack of earnings expectations for the latest report and the absence of recent news articles prevents a fully comprehensive analysis.


**9.  Recommendations:**

Given the mixed signals, a thorough investigation is needed before taking action. This should include:

* **Obtaining the missing earnings expectations for the October 30th, 2024 report.**  This is critical to properly assess the recent financial performance.
* **Reviewing recent news from reliable sources (such as Shacknews and FINBOLD) to understand recent market events affecting LLY.** This is especially important given the recent price drop.
* **Consulting with a financial advisor to discuss your risk tolerance and investment goals before making any investment decisions.**

This report provides a preliminary analysis; further investigation is strongly recommended before investing in LLY.
