## Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) Stock Analysis Report

**1. Performance Comparison & Outperformance:**

Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY) is a global pharmaceutical company developing and manufacturing medicines and biologics.  The cumulative return of LLY is significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 (VOO).  The difference between LLY's cumulative return (546.13%) and VOO's cumulative return (116.43%) is **429.7%**.  The relative outperformance, considering the historical range of the difference, places LLY at the 68.9th percentile. This indicates a substantially higher return compared to the benchmark index.  The provided Alpha values of 0.0 suggest that the excess return isn't consistently attributed to skillful stock picking but rather other factors, possibly related to market-specific factors.  The high Beta values however, point to a high sensitivity to overall market movements.


**2. Recent Price Movements:**

* **Closing Price:** $760.85
* **Last Market Price:** $761.48
* **5-Day Moving Average:** $769.98
* **20-Day Moving Average:** $775.96
* **60-Day Moving Average:** $799.74

The stock price is currently trading below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a potential downtrend.  The difference between the last market price and the moving averages is not significant enough to signal an immediate sharp reversal, but it does warrant further monitoring.

**3. Technical Indicators & Expected Return:**

* **RSI:** 38.86  (Approaching oversold territory, potentially suggesting a bounce, but confirmation is needed.)
* **PPO:** -0.22 (Negative value indicates bearish momentum.)
* **Recent Relative Strength Change (20-day):** -3.6% (Short-term downward trend.)

The negative PPO and the declining relative strength suggest a bearish sentiment.  However, the RSI nearing oversold levels might indicate a potential short-term rebound. The expected return of 130.5% over the long term (2+ years) significantly exceeds the S&P 500's projected return.  A 761.48 price, which is slightly above the closing price, does not suggest a sudden sharp upturn or downturn in the price.  More data is needed for a clearer assessment.

**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

The earnings data shows significant fluctuation in EPS and revenue. While some quarters show strong earnings, there are also instances of losses.  There is a potential issue with duplicate data for 2024-10-30, necessitating clarification.  A more in-depth analysis would require access to complete and consistent financial statements.

**7. Overall Analysis:**

LLY has demonstrated strong historical outperformance compared to the S&P 500. While recent price action shows a bearish trend, the RSI suggests potential for a short-term rebound. The company's high and consistent profit margins are positive indicators. However, volatility in earnings and ROE necessitates a thorough examination of underlying factors.  The expected long-term return is significantly higher than the benchmark, but this projection relies on several assumptions that require deeper investigation. Further analysis of the company's financial statements, pipeline, and competitive landscape is crucial for a more comprehensive assessment.  The duplicate earnings data needs clarification.
