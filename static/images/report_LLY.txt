The table shows consistently high CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) over the years.  Alpha values fluctuate, indicating periods of outperformance and underperformance relative to the market. Beta values are generally low, suggesting lower volatility than the overall market. Market capitalization (Cap(B)) exhibits strong growth.

**2. Recent Price Movement:**

LLY's price has experienced a recent decline.  The price is below its 5, 20, and 60-day moving averages, suggesting a bearish trend. The price drop of $2.94 (-0.39%) from the previous close should be monitored.


**3. Technical Indicators and Expected Return:**

The RSI of 32.90 indicates an oversold condition, potentially suggesting a buying opportunity.  However, the negative PPO (-0.40) indicates bearish momentum.  The recent 20-day relative divergence change of +0.3 suggests a short-term upward trend, although the current price is below major moving averages. The MRI suggests a medium level of market risk. Given the expected return of 85.3% over the long term (2+ years), the investment appears potentially attractive despite the current short-term bearish signals. The significant price drop may be attributed to market-wide correction or specific news impacting LLY.


**4. Recent Earnings Analysis:**

| 날짜       | EPS     | 매출         |

Earnings show some volatility, with a significant drop in EPS during 2023-11-02 and 2024-10-30, which is potentially why the stock price dropped. Further investigation into the cause is necessary.  Revenue remains relatively stable. There's a discrepancy in the dates for Oct 30th, necessitating clarification.

**6.  Overall Conclusion:**

LLY has shown exceptional historical performance, significantly outperforming the S&P 500.  However, recent price action shows a short-term bearish trend.  The oversold RSI suggests a potential buying opportunity, but the negative PPO and below-average moving averages warrant caution.  The company's financial health appears strong, with high profit margins and growing revenue.  The long-term outlook remains positive, given the predicted substantial outperformance relative to the S&P 500.  Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the recent earnings volatility and price drop.  Investors should carefully consider the short-term risks against the long-term potential.  A deeper dive into the factors behind the October 2024 EPS drop and clarifying the duplicated date entry are crucial for a more comprehensive analysis.
